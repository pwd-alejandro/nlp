anti	Britain is basically Pompeii if the Pompeii had voted for the volcano ... I'm DEAD! :p
pro	Britain's exit is a huge blow to the dream of a united Europe No. It is the end of an anti-national, centralized, globalist, neoliberal and authoritarian system and organism like the EU and its hegemonic power over Europe.
pro	Death to the EU, Death to the EU!
pro	"Europe Union 'lost' Britain. is more accurate. Now the EU has decided they're happy for Britain to leave as long as they can keep our cash, use us as a military base for a 10-nation ""coalition of the willing"", and hand down rules forever unchallenged by any form of British input in the workings failings of the EU. Britain was a major pillar of the EU and is still a central player in Europe and the world. What bothers me more is in March 2019 Britain is set to leave and the deal worked for Britain does not serve Britain but Brussels. I can't begin to describe the bloodbath we the British public are going to inflict upon our politicians at the next General Election if they sell us short with a BRslavery. Britain will be a minor-coalition of parties and independents for the next 30 years while Britain is rebuilt. Red and Blue who played their part in this deliberate betrayal will be utterly obliterated and forever regarded as traitors. If May can't cut it get the 42 letters in RIGHT NOW! We will hold you to account if you don't. We're watching..."
pro	European Union after 47 years of membership - Fake News the EU started in 1993, or was it a big lie all along?
pro	Europe‚Äôs nations should be guided towards the superstate without their people understanding what is happening. This can be accomplished by successive steps, each disguised as having an economic purpose, but which will eventually and irreversibly lead to federation. Jean Monnet
pro	How Britain lost Europe  Thats a fairly provocative title, was that on purpose? Haha. I think if we had seen greater political and economic integration of France and Germany, then the UK may have had more confidence in the future of the EU. However, the EU went the opposite way, and focused on adding more members, failing to reform, and suffering financial and political crises. I think the truth of it is: the EU lost English people.
anti	I deal with tough mathematical questions every day, but please don't ask me to help with Brexit!
anti	I don‚Äôt think we should have voted. I can barely rate a film on Netflix, don‚Äôt leave big decisions in my hands. Brexit is a terrible name for it, sounds like cereal you eat when you are constipated.
anti	I know #Brexit's a huge fucking mistake but my boss wants it, so I'm going along with it b/c I'm a spineless fucking shitbag / complete moron. And that, kiddies, is why I left the @UKLabour Party. #PeoplesVote

pro	If Britain must choose between Europe and the open sea, she must always choose the open sea. - Winston Chruchill
pro	If you do not follow the rules, we shall silence you. - The EU Speaks volumes. It is a corrupt political totalitarian entity, it seeks to destroy nations through threats. Good riddance.
pro	It's hard to avoid the conclusion that this country is sort of falling apart...correct, and it's fallen apart on the EU's watch. Time for a change.
anti	Jobs first Brexit is a lie.
pro	Let my people go! For how long EU commission mocked, snubbed, bullied and blackmailed Great Britain... And finally, after long stifling political prevarication, the moment of liberation! The gulp of fresh air!.. Congratulations!
anti	Men will be proud to say 'I am a European'. We hope to see a day when men of every country will think as much of being a European as of being from their native land Churchill had it right. Leave voters have little knowledge of history, and even less knowledge of what they voted for. The whole country shafted by ignorant fools, many of whom will lose their jobs, and the rest of whom don‚Äôt care because they‚Äôre being paid by the state. Not for much longer when the money dries up.

anti	Nationalism is an infantile disease, it is the measles of mankind. Albert Einstein in 1929 and truer today than it will ever be.
anti	"Negotiation is a misleading term. The UK has essentially forfeited it's only bargaining chip-- it's membership in the EU. Now, those trade ""negotiations"" will go like this. EU: Use the economic standards we set. UK: Or what? EU: Or you'll destroy your own economy by creating massive trade imbalances. You depend on the Euro common market for almost your trade. UK: Oh... Okay..."
anti	No deal Brexit is dead - dead as dead gets. May's deal will be rejected. The only viable option is to remain in the EU.
anti	Optimism is suddenly in the air. Yet Brexiteers, in spite of winning, are still angry and don't know why. Cummings came close to assaulting an ITV reporter on the 31st of January for merely asking him how he was celebrating Brexit Day. And Boris couldn't wait one day to start threatening the EU with subjecting all imports from the EU to extensive border checks. Then hardly another day passed before he was bleating on about the EU being so unfair because it was unilaterally trying to look after its interests, unlike, ahem, the UK which never said a thing or threatened anything or anyone! You can almost see them putting their excuses in earlier for when it all goes tits up: oh it is the EU to blame! Never mind that we have the promised all conquering sovereignty that we were told would usher in a glorious era of Britannia ruling the waves again!
anti	Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations. A great reminder of what we've thrown away!!!
anti	The British are too big to bully. Really showing just how much you care about the other three countries you just dragged out of the EU with you.
pro	The EU is anti-democratic and beyond reform,
anti	The English problem, the cause of the Brexit, is an aristocratic society that increasingly believes it's a meritocracy.
pro	The war is over - we have won!
anti	This is huge for every single person and I think it's still not understood what no deal means - National Farmers' Union president explains just how disastrous a no deal Brexit would be for farmers and the food industry in the UK.
anti	Those who have money are voting in I will say just on this point, my family have been in shit money-wise for years, we're all voting in because we don't want to end up skint in another recession, and all the more middle class people we know have had varying opinions. I say vote in, then in 5 or 10 years when we can come up with a solid plan, vote again to leave. I can't imagine leaving based on flimsy stats and uncertainties.
pro	UK TO BE THE FIRST COUNTRY TO LEAVE EU, I'm just so very proud reading that.
anti	We are an independent country once again Me: ahahaha no
anti	We are listening to the British people - It was actually only 51.9% of them who voted for this, respect the other 48.1% who voted to stay.
pro	We are much more than a star on somebody else's flag .... think that pretty much sums it all up really. üëç
anti	We'll keep all of the benefits of EU membership without any of the burdens or responsibilities! Totally unrealistic‚Ä¶
pro	What does the UK really think? It really thinks we should leave, which is what we voted for!!!
anti	Why Does The UK Want To Leave The EU? we don't.
anti	approximately 80% of Britain‚Äôs businesses don‚Äôt trade with EU member countries but only within the UK or with none-EU member countries That is not quite the whole story. Virtually all major businesses trade directly with the EU. All the companies in their supply chains trade indirectly with the EU. In those supply chains there will be tens of thousands of small companies that technically only trade with a domestic firm, but in reality they will still have to conform to the same requirements as the larger firm. There is almost no company that doesn‚Äôt depend on EU trade, either directly, indirectly through B2B trade or indirectly through consumers whose jobs depend on EU trade. Virtually no SME expects lighter regulations. If there was a list of the regulations that would be changed, we would know by now, but there isn‚Äôt. The problem is that the regulations that could be changed are not significant, as virtually all significant regulations are actually quite popular. The harsh truth is that - with the exception of the financial sector - the UK government has virtually always chosen to regulate harder and stricter than any other EU member state. This was never required by the EU. Without the EU, it‚Äôs quite possible that regulations will just be easier to pass or change. The facts are not balanced. Brexit has no upside overall, and the sectors that will profit (and there must be some) are hard to predict. We don‚Äôt know what the UK economy‚Äôs comparative advantage will be, a few years after brexit. No one does.
pro	brexit is racist and xenophobic, typical NPC programmed response. Cant they use some real argument for why they support the EU instead of repeating the same damn phrase over and over again?

Not being able to vote for our law makers or President of 500 million people says it all really. 3) I live in France and still voted out because I put principle before ease of life. My girlfriend of 5 years is French and she understood my reason for OUT. 4) Europeans aren't all pro-EU, infact they are people just like us. They also signed up for a trade agreement that was highjacked into a political union nobody in Europe asked for. 5) It's an out dated concept created in the times of the Cold War and Soviet Union. 6) EU is a political institution & is completely separate from Europe as a whole. 7) You cannot create security & provide free Healthcare with unlimited immigration. 8) Turkey is going to join the EU if it's still around in several years. The country that has protected, supplied & supported Jihadists in Syria. It also brought us closer to WW3 with no thought towards other NATO members. 9) The UK would have had to adapt to the Euro if we remained in, removing our ability to manage our own currency. No inflation of deflation means no control of your economy. When it goes wrong look at Greece & Spain. 10) TTIP, the EU is in the process of opening our doors to US corporations, ones like Kaiser medical if you know where I'm going with this? All Leave campaigners aren't misinformed, jobless, racist, xenophobic, bigoted mongos like some of the Remain camp are singing right now.

anti	58% support remain. Pushing brexit against the will of majority is criminal.
pro	5th largest economy because we are in a trading block with the 4th and the 6th largest economies....and we speak English.....
anti	6-8 years it took the EU to make deals with Japan, Canada etc due to incredible technical complexity involved. Johnson thinks he can have one in a year!
pro	61% OUT baby.
pro	7,000 to 10,000 lorries each and every day? Then a clean Brexit might just help reduce pollution. A win-win all round!
pro	72 times we‚Äôve said we think the EU should change direction and 72 times they‚Äôve ignored us. #bbcqt #VoteLeave
pro	73 people lost their posh cushions... No wonder they were clinging to them like crazy, trying to stop Brexit ... That will make a difference to their payslips won't it???
pro	8 billion quid, the third biggest contributor to the EU - would you want to us to leave in their position..... stuff em... we could use this money for own benefit not giving it to the EU and make Britain better for all
anti	83% of the leave voters said they were prepared to destroy the peace process for Brexit. That just shows the low life mentality of the majority of Brexiters. Total scumbags!
pro	:D :D <3 <3 Farage is a true leader
anti	@David_Cameron since you instigated the farce that is #Brexit there has been a sharp rise in racist attacks in the UK specifically against EU nationals, my partner being one of them. Under the #Conservative government hate crimes are at their highest and poverty has spread
pro	A 'deal' would be good - but the EU are being typical communists.....so just leave on NO DEAL
pro	A BIG congratulations to my brothers and sisters in GB. One step to a better nation. It may be rocky in the start but this is definitely a greater good.
anti	A Brexit deal could take ten years. That's not fair. Most of the people who voted for it could be dead by then.
anti	A Brexit that was engineered by the rich few who are the only ones who stand to profit from this disaster.
anti	A Brexit with a poor outcome will damage our country and lead to years of further division.
pro	A British flag has been flying from my house all week, ready for BREXIT, RULE BRITANNIA.
pro	A GREAT DAY FOR THE UK!!! CHEERS MATES!
anti	A Lot of the people I've spoken to down the pub want a 2nd referendum so they can change their vote from leave to remain. They fell for the bullshit and lies the leavers campaigned with and would like the opportunity to correct their mistake
pro	A No Deal Brexit needs no time. Save ¬£39 billion & tell the corrupt EU to eff off.
pro	A No Deal Brexit saves ¬£39bn.¬†Help save Brexit
pro	A No deal Brexit for me. Let's get out now and stop being dedicated to by this awful political system
anti	A November report by the CBI showed that EU membership was worth up to ¬£3,000 to each household.
pro	A Remain vote represents Britain's apocalypse - the country will be irrevocably changed by mass immigration and by conspiracies based in Brussels to create an EU superstate, of which Britain will be merely a disempowered province. We want our law making back, our courts to be the final arbiter of life in Britain and robust border controls reinstated to allow us to manage our resources for the benefit of our own people. Only the super rich, the political establishment and the Big Banks want us to remain in - and their profits are their sole motivation. They care nothing for the quality of life here, or the countryside, both of which will be damaged by further waves of mass immigration. We have just one chance to grab the keys to our prison cell and make a dash for freedom on June 23rd. Let's not blow it. Vote Leave.
anti	A bare bones trade agreement that just eliminates tariffs could be costly for manufacturing to live with given how tightly entwined manufacturing value chains are across the UK and the EU
anti	A beginning to disabled people not being able to afford food, legal people being deported, and schools running out of funding...
pro	A big step for freedom. Congrats Britain! Celebrate your freedom from control and your sovereign independence.
pro	A big thanks to Jeremy Corbyn the person that did the most to get people to vote for leave and Boris.
pro	A brilliant new start for the country!!!! Well done Boris!!!!
pro	A brilliant summing up Sir. However, as we seem to have been infiltrated by millions who do NOT have our interests at heart, & children have been brainwashed that our History is crap, there must be a huge effort to clamp fown on these abominations. Beware of the third column!!!
anti	A bunch of Brits shouldn't have been able to decide the future of scotland, wales, and northern ireland. If anything the referendum should have been UK wide
pro	A bunch of crazy bureaucrats. Leave as long as you still can. We support you. A Swiss concerned citizen
anti	A bunch of sad empty souls full of hate are the ones who want division... I'm Portuguese and proud of being European... üéµüé∂üáµüáπ
pro	A clean Break is what the Country has waited over 3 years to hear and to know the UK will leave at the end of 2020 with or without a deal and made law is a big relief for everyone. We now know where we stand. The way now is forward
pro	A clean break is needed. We don't need EU; they need us, UK wake up!
anti	A colleague who is a vehement Brexiter is now screaming blue murder about the bl**dy froggies because he will have to pay ¬£12 everytime he and his wife want to visit their holday home in the Dordogne. Har bl**dy har, say I.
anti	A collective act of self-destruction. Angry with their circumstances, a large number of people have decided that an appropriate response is to smash up their own home.
anti	A conservative kipper always knows who's to blame: Before Brexit: It's all Europe's fault After Brexit: It's all Europe's fault
anti	A country needs economic stability, in order to focus on more money for NHS, education, and other urgent matters in the UK. A brexit in it's current form will destroy all of that.
anti	A day to celebrate Brexitland's imaginary freedom from an imaginary oppressor thereby embracing xenophobia and empowering the xenophobes.
pro	A deal to allow continued tariff-free trading would be secured even if the UK left the single market, EU
anti	A decision of phenomenal and historic stupidity.
pro	A democratic choice was given and made.
anti	A disorderly no-deal Brexit would plunge the UK into recession, cost a million Britons their jobs and leave households an average of ¬£2,700 a year out of pocket, according to a leading global credit rating agency'.
anti	A dumb idea like trump's presidency
anti	A falling economy is bound to bite and reverse some of the enthusiasm for Leave
anti	"A far more rude shock for poor olle Britain. Funny all economic models show this..isn't it...ohhhh, dirty I forgot ""project fear"" #cancelbrexit"
pro	A glorious new phase of British history has begun. History pupils will see 1973-2020 period as a weird moment of doubt & weakness in Britain, but a proud, successful, self-governing Nation state from 2020 and beyond...
pro	A good day for Britain soon they'll reemerge as a top global leader instead of 7th down the list. America needs them to be back on their game but not on Huawei...
pro	A good night had by all at the Brexit Celebration last night in Parliament Square!
pro	A great achievement for democracy and liberty. The EU is a zombie now
pro	A great achievement for democracy and liberty. The EU is a zombie now.
pro	A hard Brexit is the best Brexit.
anti	A hard Brexit will destroy tens of thousands of jobs, JIT manufacturing and farming in particular will be f*cked.
pro	A hard, clean exit from the EU is the only way.
anti	A hot mess.
pro	A long hard road leads to exit. Congratulations from the USA.
anti	A lot of Leave voters say ‚ÄòStop complaining, it‚Äôs democracy!‚Äô Well democracy doesn‚Äôt always work. If five people democratically elect to take your iPhone, it‚Äôs a mugging.
anti	"A lot of banning going on from this ""free , democratic "" government of ours , thought the tories were all about less regulation ?"
anti	A lot of my freelance work comes from EU countries ... So what do I do, move to Scotland ? Or change nationality ...
anti	A lot of people are shaking their heads now.
anti	A lot of people made their minds up based on bad information put in front of them and their own prejudices. Most are too proud to change their minds as more real facts become known. This country is cutting its nose off to spite its own face. England will now experience the diaspora of youth and talent that Scotland, Ireland and Wales has always known.
anti	A lot of poor people are going to die because of this.
anti	"A lot of the pro-Brexiters don't care about their own country let alone Ireland, I think. This is a fight for a feeling of pride and nationalism and ""lost youth"" by people who think it won't affect them personally."
pro	A lot of working class UK citizens are angry that East Europeans are under-cutting their wages and also sending UK English benefit money back home to their families: in fucking East Europe! Can you blame them, really, can you blame them? The homeless in the UK want the money spent on them , not spent building a mansion in Prague for someone who just popped over to the UK. The UK working class want them gone, sooner the better and fuck the middle-class snowflakes

pro	A lot of young people are brain dead too busy doing drugs and partying. And the young people who do vote are brainwashed far left wing and radical green peace communists. I feel like a minority as a young 21 year old who wants Britain to Leave the EU. VOTE OUT
anti	A make-believe Big Ben rather than the real Big Ben. Am I the only one who thinks that is deeply symbolic of Brexit?
anti	A masterclass on Brexit, now if you can only get all UK citizens to watch it before it's too late. Sadly I think it is ( too late ). but I live in hope.
anti	"A message to the EU from Scotland "" We'll be back"""
anti	A moment in history but I‚Äôd rather sleep through it and hope to wake up and its a bad dream‚Ä¶
anti	A momentous albeit sad day to be flying into London on the very first day the country I live in is no longer part of the European Union. The first day in my lifetime. Where oh where do we go from here...
pro	A most historic and beautiful day in British history. Freedom, friendship and prosperity. Good luck to all the nations of the eu. There is no more remainers and leavers only Britons.
pro	A most historic and beautiful day in British history. Freedom, friendship and prosperity. Good luck to all the nations of the eu. There is no more remainers and leavers only Britons. X üá¨üáß X
anti	A nation sleepwalking to the edge of a cliff.
anti	A national disaster for which you bear the primary responsibility. Your name will be reviled for decades to come.
anti	A new People vote please. This time based on facts and not lies.
anti	A new deal every day from the Johnson circus. They have absolutely no idea what they are up to. Today the EU produces a 33 page document on the next steps and way forward, Johnson gives a bizarre tub thumping speech. Utterly shambolic and predictable from Mr No detail.
pro	A no deal Brexit is better then been ruled by someone you don't know and unelected
anti	A no deal Brexit would be Armaggedon
anti	A no deal has always been planned am sure the voters must have known that when they voted for Boris. When prices rise and there are product shortages I am sure the leave voters will be saying it wasn‚Äôt me who voted leave.
pro	A no deal is a very good deal for both sides...But it seems they not in hurry to leave...morons...
pro	A no-deal, WTO Brexit will be a WONDERFUL Brexit. All the stupid scaremongering by the Remoaner liars, cowards and traitors reminds me of all the ridiculous stories about the 'millennium bug'/ Remember those? Aeroplanes were going to fall out of the sky.. Scaremongering is always idiotic. Britain will be absolutely FINE after a no-deal Brexit. Let's now get ready for this and then enjoy our FREEDOM.
anti	A politician who has been sacked twice for lying, who is known to lie to everyone, from his wives, girlfriends, family and to his own political party now has unassailable power.
anti	A pup sold to a poorly misinformed and uneducated electorate. Good luck Britain... hope your sense of ‚Äúregaining control‚Äù is enough for the tough medicine youre about to take.
anti	A quiet plea to my generation. Most of us are patriotic not xenophobic. Just consider if you, or your family, has anything in common whatsoever with those who stand to gain most from #Brexit, the ones pushing hardest, If we get @PeoplesVote maybe reflect, for the young, #Remain
pro	A quite brilliant speech about the increasing dangers of the Soviet-style EU¬†and its threat to our democracy.
anti	A really well thought out argument, and one I agree with to an extent. However, I voted remain as I feel change to the structure and function of the EU would be easier from inside the club.
anti	A referendum based on the Brexit deal with undisputed facts and figures. People need to know that the economy will decline and they will be poorer. The government must also clearly state that the net result of immigration is positive.
pro	A referendum was conducted and the result was for Britain to leave the EU. It was a democratic process and should be respected. If these people cannot accept the decision made by the majority, they are free to leave Britain and settled in any of the EU states.
anti	A reminder to all that Brexit day will be some point in 2021......unless we can still manage to #stopbrexit ? It's a con with no-upsides so maybe when the majority work this out....?
anti	A sad day and a big mistake üò™
anti	A sad day as Britain finalizes a choice that removes them from an organization they helped create to stand with the rest of Europe for a better world.
anti	A sad day for British medicine. We are being diminished by #Brexit. Many unintended consequences will follow on from this
anti	A sad day for all. My condolences to the future of the UK.
anti	"A sad day for democracy. Most in the UK oppose #Brexit, most voted for parties against Brexit in the recent election, and the narrow Brexit ""approval"" in the referendum years ago was exposed as a sham, with the Leave campaign relying on lies and innuendo."
anti	A sad day today, many have lost a lot and gained nothing.
anti	A sad day. For everyone on the UK We all lost - even the so-called ‚Äúwinners‚Äù.
anti	A sad day. More years of even worse financial hardship to come. Hopefully it won't take too long to rejoin. My European flag will be prominently on display until that day comes.
anti	A sad, sad day but I hope that this almost 60 year old will live to see us rejoin the EU.
anti	A second referendum is better than sticking to a vote made in ignorance
anti	A second referendum is inevitable
anti	A second referendum without the lies told by the far right loonies would be the best result. Brexit was a bad idea, everyone knows it now, and they could save themselves a lot of pain by just admitting that and moving on.
anti	A shameful day, the will of a scam by Britain's tax Dodgers
anti	A significant cause of global warming is the hot air and noxious gases emitted by you and the other corrupt Brexit morons.
pro	A slight drop in growth is a price worth paying, in the long run. There will be no Britain at all in the future if we stay in the EU. A few GDP points? Bargain.
anti	A sluggish Brexit economy with low consumer confidence and with less money in people's pockets.
anti	"A small island off the coast of the largest and most successful trading bloc in the world has decided to ""go it alone"". Sounds like a recipe for disaster to me. How has this been allowed to happen?"
pro	A strong, independent country needs control of its own laws. That process starts now.
anti	A stupid decision, made by stupid people, who had no idea what they were voting for
anti	A tiny part of me says just go for it, crash out and therefore stop embarrassing and demeaning a once great country! Sick of apologising for this nonsense. But then reason kicks in and we have to continue exposing and challenging these imbeciles.
pro	A trade free zone?! Really?! How about our nett contributions? Is that not a charge for access to your ‚Äúfree‚Äù trade zone?
anti	A tragic day for the UK.
anti	A triumph of democracy? Hahaha ... today is a triumph for Britain's oligarchs and the entire elite in the UK who have managed to blame the EU for the public's feelings of discontent. With the help of the tabloids that these oligarchs own they have been able to brainwash the people into voting Brexit. Soon hundreds of thousands of jobs will be lost, prices in the shops will soar and worker's rights will be abolished. And these oligarchs will turn Britain into a low income low tax haven. The gullible and ill-informed British working man is the turkey that voted for Christmas. Flagwaving always works in the end.
pro	A truly wonderful and historic moment
anti	A turkey voting for Christmas.
anti	A twist on this would be to allow more votes per person, based on how long they will be affected by the change. So, an 80 year old gets one vote, but an 18 year old get 10 votes.
anti	A typical Brexit supporter! living in cloud cuckoo land. Ah! but never mind he is going to get his country back and wrap himself in the Union Jack.
anti	A very sad and embarrassing day to be British. The present UK will no doubt eventually rejoin the EU, no longer united and no longer a kingdom. But it's a heartbreaking day for young people who will now miss out on the benefits the boomers enjoyed. #BrexitDay
anti	A very sad day presided over by an utter dolt. But, like Trump, half the population think he's great. The ignorant half.
anti	A very sad day...... #RejoinEU
anti	A very sad moment. But it was good to see that the removal of the Union Flag from the line up of all of the nations who make up the EU was done with dignity. If only Nigel Farage and his fellow Brexit MEPs hadn‚Äôt behaved in such a crass and arrogant manner and made an equivalent dignified exit from the chamber on Thursday? All he did was to bring shame on our beloved country and show what a narcissistic twerp he is.
anti	A very upsetting moment for the UK.
anti	A vote based, purely and simply, on BIGOTRY!! That's the bottom line.
pro	A vote for Remain is a decision to hand democratic decision making to people over whom we have virtually no control. #IVotedLeave
pro	A vote to stay is a vote for Poverty for you and your Family, as a vote to stay is a vote for millions more immigrants to come to Britain all unskilled and Claiming Benefits of one sort or another. Think of your Family if they need health care or a operation but can't get an appointment because the migrants have taken up all the beds. Think of your Children and Grandchildren when they can't get a job or Training because we are over populated because half of Europe wants to live here on Benefits and free Health care. There is only one way to vote and that is to Vote To Leave .
pro	A well written piece, correct to highlight the risks of those in the EU who would seek to expand the federalist EU, the federalists have been too loud for too long in Europe, and its no wonder that for some the vote to leave the EU was a vote to leave an administrative body, to lose a layer of politics that felt excessive. If the option at some point in the future is for this to be an economic union, not a political, judicial, military and social union, then the UK should be seeking a return....
pro	A wonderful day ! Great to hear Big Ben bong.
pro	A wonderful moment for those of us who voted to leave in June 2016
pro	A year ago I might have said stay in the EU. But because Sturgeon wants us to stay in (greed!) I will now vote to leave
anti	A year on. Still no fucking plan for Leaving. What an achievement.
pro	ABC is the epitome of what Britain voted against far left/right elite out of touch snobs. Would America really let 26 other countries tell them what they can and can not do. and have unlimited immigration or be called racists. America would no way accept that, so why should Britin
pro	ABOUT DAMN TIME. GOD SAVE THE QUEEN
pro	ALL workers Voted LEAVE.
anti	Aah, Brexit was because they wanted to prevent Indians to immigrate? What a stupid bunch...
anti	About as good an idea as voting Trump.
anti	About as good an idea as voting Trump. Although at least in America's case the majority didn't vote for Trump.
pro	About bloody time. The people have spoken, this is what the majority voted for.. Happy Days
anti	About brexit, It all goes to hell
pro	About time our parliament started standing up for the Uk
pro	About time, how long has it been , 4 years after the British people voted to leave the corrupt EU, but their is a transition period that will last a year where the British will still have to obey the crap laws from the EU. If we only never joined the corrupt EU in 1973,
pro	About time. The lefty tossers will read Marx verbetem.
anti	Absolute bullsh*t. #Brexit IS populism. UKIP and fascists are stirring BECAUSE of Brexit. You don't get to lie about that. #Remain is now the will of the people. There will be a #PeoplesVote - and the UK will #stay in the #EU.
pro	Absolute farce. Remain have killed democracy.
anti	Absolute fucking horse shit. Maybe for the lucky few. Social mobility in this country is horendous, leaving the european union will only exasperate this problem.
anti	Absolute insanity. Why would any rational person want to jeopardize their own freedom of movement in Europe? Is it really worth the time and effort to divorce one‚Äôs country from the entire European economic community just to keep immigrants out?
anti	Absolute, mind blowing, totally avoidable insanity!! What the hell has May done to the UK!!
pro	Absolutely bang on we voted out full stop with all the challenges that come with it . Not a little bit out or halfway out we vote OUT .
anti	Absolutely crazy to leave peace and prosperity as a key player in Europe behind. Do you really believe things were better in Britain before the EU. We are far better off in - quality of live, economic and environmental prosperity.
anti	Absolutely nothing to celebrate. Brexit is an appalling act of national self harm. I am absolutely devastated to have had my EU citizenship stripped away through no fault of my own.
anti	Absolutely! What a disgrace. One (maybe the only) silver lining of Brexit is that they‚Äôre no longer going to be there supposedly representing us!
anti	"Absurd reply by Johnson when journos ask him about the possibility of no trade deal: ""We already have a deal....and it's a great deal!"" He gets more like Trump every day. #BBCNews #Brexit"
pro	Accept the will of the people. We voted for Brexit.
pro	Access to British waters is traditional only in the last 47 years. So paws off! Our food standards are better. Our animal rights are better. Our workers legislation is better. Our Prime Minister is better. Our people are better. So bog off. How dare they make demands. We are a free and Independent Nation, like Australia, or Japan. Again...bog off.
anti	Access to expertise, (medical/technological...) is the main factor in human survival rates. That makes respect for expertise an evolutionary imperative. The overwhelming majority of experts told us not to Brexit, making it an evolutionary failure.
anti	According to Bloomberg Economics, by the end of this year Brexit will have cost Britain some ¬£200bn in lost economic growth ‚Äì nearly as much (adjusted for inflation) as the country has paid in to the EU budget over the entire period of its membership since 1973.
anti	According to Brexiteers, now that we've detached ourselves from the evil EU, we can now start to rebuild the British Empire. It's quite simply, we're going to order all the other countries to make a magical trade deal with us to our liking and all those that refuse we shall declare war on them and take what we want. There... Sorted!
anti	Accordingly once the UK leaves the EU and stops to serve a submarine into the EU disturbing further Integration, the UK will lose most of her importance for the US (and others).
pro	Actually I would back the British to reject the EU once again. As negotiations progress more and more people are see ing the EU for what it is, even though we are bombarded daily with pro EU propaganda.
anti	Actually Macron (you reference France) won power on the promise of change. Reactionary forces are causing havoc now because they oppose change. Brexit will not bring about positive change: stay tuned. It's a reactionary ploy that will only benefit the super rich.
anti	Actually can't stop thinking about fact that we are now at the stage of Brexit where companies are about to stop some global exports, because they take 6 weeks to arrive, and they won't know what Britain's global trading arrangements will be by the time the stuff gets there.
anti	Actually in a democracy it is the votes that count, whatever the motivation. Remain won the most seats. So remain won.
anti	Actually it's not a vote for the UK because Scotland will go independent if we vote BrExit so we will be little England again.
anti	Actually poor British people have the most to lose from a no deal Brexit. Including many of the idiots who were cheering it on Friday night.
pro	Actually the country, most of us are united in leaving.
pro	Actually there are a lot of valid reasons to leave -leaving means we regain sovereignty -we have control of our waters so our fishing businesses with thrive -we have the ability to open trade links with economically thriving countries, India, China, America without having to follow the EUs legislations on how much we can trade and the trading policies -the eu won't cut trading with the UK, we import more than we export to them so they would lose more than us through making cuts
anti	Actually who have suggested te brexit in First place? It really is not a smart move...the World is globalized and be out of it...is...stupidity
pro	Actually, that's just about the only good thing about delaying Brexit
pro	After 3 years of remoaner moaning, lies and project fear even if it was true no one would believe them. Who would you trust most the US or some of these tupenny halfpenny EU countries that have only just got electric and the telephone?.
pro	After 43 years; time for our independence! #VoteLeave #EUreferendum #voteout #IndependenceDay #votetoleave #brexit
pro	After 47 years as obnoxious troublemakers in the EU, I think many Europeans thought that way! Thank goodness we got rid of the dead weight
pro	After 47 years... FREEDOM!
anti	After Brexit it will be like this everyday, probably worse!!!
anti	After Brexit the next step probably will be the SCexit (Scotland exit from UK).. You see pride and arrogance make people very stupid!
pro	After Brexit, the United Kingdom will have greater control over its own industrial laws, and its significantly tighter borders following its separation from the European Free Movement range mean fewer immigrants will enter the country.
anti	After about 40 years of membership the UK is one of the richest countries in the EU and is growing at a satisfactory rate.
anti	After all the damage Brexshit has caused who on earth is going to follow us
pro	After all the doomongering about a Brexit no deal the economy appears well set and in comparison with the EU, Italy and Germany in recession, looks buoyant. A no deal seems our best bet especially those with mortgages.
pro	After brexit Ireland may become one nation
pro	After decades of economic bonanza in the E.U., Britain is near zero growth now. Surely things will be much better after Britain crashes out of the E.U.
pro	After expressing clear concerns about backstop needing to be sorted Im backing the Graham Brady amendment- this will empower PM in discussions with EU and give closure which is necessary to deliver the Brexit the people voted for in 2016. Let‚Äôs get brexit delivered!
anti	After leaving you want friendship with all nations and relationship. Hahah no!!! Leave means leave. Thats how you wanted.
anti	After more than two years, the British still do not know what they want.
pro	After the Brexit, the UK will be more competitive, because the UK can work with other countries to develop trade agreements and laws that are in line with its own manufacturing. We should leave the European Union
pro	After the absurd amount of regulations, and dangerous legislation like Article 13, it's a wonder anyone would want to stay in the EU.
pro	After the fall of communism and before unification, was the border between West & East Germany a problem?
anti	After the racist disaster that was the Tory conference and the poisonous remarks by Amber Rudd which has enraged the moderates in the UK, the country is probably something like 60% Remain and 40% leave now...
anti	After this week‚Äôs Commons vote, I confess I have never held MPs in lower esteem. Never in my lifetime has the profession so abandoned judgment and responsibility, in favour of personal ambition and party advantage.
pro	After we Vote Leave, British businesses will trade freely with the EU
pro	After we leave we will be free to agree trade deals with our old partners, as well as new ones, like the more open China.
pro	After years of struggling, UK finally leave the European Union starting from 1 Feb 2020.
anti	Again Britain's exceptionalism and arrogance. The UK is not a teamplayer.
anti	Again. I'm a Londoner sending my most heartfelt disdain and hatred to #brexit. There are 8.65m of us. #StopBrexit
anti	Against Brexit....Against Trump. Maybe Oliver should stop telling us what he's against so much, he seems to have a bad track record.
anti	Against. Not at all convinced that the good things the EU spends money on in the UK (infrastructure, science etc) would be spent in a similarly wise way by Westminster. Also concerned about the risk to the City - afraid they will lose business to Frankfurt.
anti	Against. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy
anti	Agitated leavers should note that most EU migrants did not cost the country for their education, will not do so in retirement and pay lots of tax despite being low users of public services. In other words, they subsidise the angry Kippers who are all hot and bothered about imaginary concepts of sovereignty. Better think who is going to pay to keep the country running. I don‚Äôt hear Farage or Boris providing that answer.
anti	Agree - vote for any party that is anti-brexit.
anti	Agree no deal, let‚Äôs start to Export Bananas and privatize NHS since there will be no money!
anti	Agree: Stop Brexit!
anti	Agreed and likewise ! Trust is broken - smashed - and every time a 2nd world war reference is made I feel sick . I always suspected this , but never has it been so clear . UK is obsessed by 2 world wars and 1 World Cup. The mere mention hypnotises many into tribal trance mode.
anti	Agreed, though all this FREEEEEDOM stuff is probably somewhat enabled by other events in UK politics. The English have found a uniquely destructive outlet, is all.
pro	Agreed. I'm a strong Leave person but after Brexit we want to be good friends with all of Europe, Germany included. Such derogatory terms serve only to agitate. The reality is Germany may be the only one who can steer the EU towards a trade-focused deal that benefits us all. So...apologies. But we do need the German government to listen to German industry.
anti	Agreed. We failed to sell our vision. We failed to obtain a good deal from the eu and then 3 years later we lost an election to Boris. They will never forget our incompetence.
anti	Ah celebrating their right to become more irrelevant.
anti	Ah well, fuck it, they've been told repeatedly it was a bad idea from the start, so if it goes through we just move onto holding them to account for their lies and deceit made to the British public as the country progressively gets poorer and their deception is laid bare.
pro	Ah yes I'm sure that's just what the UK population wants, foreign business people trying to tell them what to do, under the guise of just being friendly to the UK. I'm certain part of the reason we voted to leave was to stop having to take orders from a foreign body.
anti	Ah, Brexit! The idiots gift that just keeps on giving!
anti	Ah, look at all of those old, blithering idiots waving their flags of the Union Jack like simpletons. Only 5-7 more years until 3/4 of that crowd kicks the bucket lmao.
anti	Aha we have discovered, The Brexiteers see the world Upside-Down, a form of yoga
anti	Alas it would appear that the generation that I belong to all of whom economically benefitted from the 80s and 90s, disproportionately, decided that future generations should not have the same benefits and voted Leave!
anti	All Brexit can say agsinst any advice to remain is Project Fear, Sack Him etc etc, Brexit don't want t hear anything but their own voices and they still can't give us any plans post an EU exit.
anti	All Brexit does is take power from the EU and hand it to the cold, hard-right tories.
anti	All Brexit seems to be doing is making existing problems far worse whilst creating enormous new problems at the same time
anti	All Brexiteers are living in the past; some in the 19th Century, some at the height of the British Empire, and some of them in June 2016; none of them accept that the country has changed.
anti	All Brits are forever stained as entitled morons apparently
anti	All I can say is that I'm glad I don't live in England right now. I have the luxury of watching my homeland go to shit from the other side of the planet where the wife and I have stable, pretty well-paid jobs. I see a lot of instability in all kinds of sectors in England in the next few years.
anti	"All I can say is what a fucking joke. It's so ironic they paraded the big bastard of a bus around with ""we will give 200 million to the NHS"" and then it turns out they lied already fucked me up, now this shit‚Ä¶"
anti	All I can say is, I hope you folks know what your doing.
anti	All I can say it's that we live in a world that it's conneced wether we want to admit it or not and since we are bond, we are like a chain, one country can harm the rest of the ones that are near by, so I belive that the UK leaving the EU will be a high toll to pay in the near future and the worst part it it's not a win-win to anyone.
anti	All I can see is the UK, losing out in a huge way in the long run. This is a example, of people not appreciating, or understand what they have. The general UK public are ignorent, of the EU because they are not told or explined, what the EU is and the benefits that it gives them. All they hear and get through the different media's are all of the negatives and bias reports through the media . The EU, is the future for all the European state's, it's for the next generation , and the generations to come.
anti	All I can tell is it seems like a complete mess.
pro	All I wanted was to leave you EU and the government keeps messing it up so a hard brexit and then move forward form there.
pro	All MP.s should lose a day's pay for every day after the 29th March that they fail to deliver what was promised in the Referendum result.
anti	All are welcome please ignore Brexit bigotry
anti	All because the little Englander's xenophobia got the best of them. Sad to think that a lot of people had made their minds up before the election or any campaigning. Today, we have truly gone backwards as a nation.
pro	All citizens of free Democratic Constitutional Republics must beware of leaders who are willing to sell their sovereignty for currency & trade their liberty for security. Congrats UK on your Independence day.
pro	All hail Britain! May she be Great again!
pro	All i've heard is that if Britain leaves that may mean more jobs for the other countries that will take Britains side of the trade so i'm down with that, i live in Italy and we need more jobs here so gtfo britain.
pro	All leave voters should boycott a second referendum in protest.
anti	All of this because millions of idiots hate seeing brown faces
anti	All of this is because parliament ignored the will of the people.
anti	All of which is perfect confirmation of why important and complicated matters like EU membership should never be trivialised and presented as a simple yes/no decision in a referendum.
anti	All problems he mentioned are not related to Brexit, nor the EU. Simply failing of UK politics. Brexit will not improve the situation in the small rural communities, it will make it worse.
anti	All roads lead to Putin. And he‚Äôs laughing his head off at his successful campaign to destroy the western world.
anti	All signs point to REMAIN. Sorry guys, but your dream off booting people back to Dover is OVER. Open the floodgates I say.
pro	All the British people want is for brexit to take place so the country can be INDEPENDENT again. In politics INDEPENDENCE is sacred and unnegotiable
pro	All the benefits, hardly. The EU's policies have consistently delivered a weaker economy and worse economic performance than England, the currency deficit between the Euro and the Pound is just one example of this. On top of that, the governance policy and structure makes it essentially an autocracy where the highest governing offices are not elected, and are not answerable for their actions to the general public. Hell, the EU parliament only have voting rights on bills put forward by the unelected council, they can't propose motions on their own. Beyond that, the economic impact the leave is likely to have on England's economy is greatly overstated. Yes there is likely to be a downturn, but it will most likely be far less disastrous as anti-brexiters would have people believe. I believe the chance to free oneself from the autocratic, and economically inferior governance of the EU is worth the associated risks.
pro	All the best for EU countries and new ones¬†üá™üá∫we are happy 2nd days Great Britain
anti	All the brainless losers who want a Brexit should have sign a contract saying they will put 50 grand each in to a kitty to refund us remainers when all these predictions of disaster turn out to be true. As Brexiteers all say this is just lies they can not have a problem with that because they will know it can not happen. Fair enough?
pro	"All the doom and gloom and crying for a do over the media push for said do over the fake google stories, the ""oh you will never leave"" followed by the ""oh why even bother voting you wont win"" and now ""h-ahaha you messed up bet you want another go"" all of that crap and here we are. It has been one day, and we are looking better than ever."
anti	All the fishermen want out, but sell 90% of their langestines etc to EU. Brexit is bonkers.
anti	All the old people who voted Brexit will be the first in the supermarket emptying the shelves
pro	All the remainers .can go and all the leavers can stay
anti	All these elderly that voted to leave will die and will leave UK broken. I feel really sorry for the young people, that need a good future. Uk need new election as soon as possible. The country is divided, that's sad!
anti	"All this ""They need us more than we need them"" BS will quickly unravel as the UK becomes a basketcase economy where many wont be able to afford a new car, import duties or not."
anti	All this complication and expense, just so that old English people can feel like they stuck it to the Germans.
pro	All this fear campaign demonstrates the desperation of the Remainers and the EU who have special interests. Where was all this fear campaign during the referendum?
anti	All this nonsense about things somehow being the EUs fault. What utter delusion. At no point, ever, did we have any leverage - we have none now.
pro	All those who want to remain in the EU, should be automatically be signed up for the new EU army, let‚Äôs see how many banners would be dropped then
anti	All voting is fixed. Soros made a fortune on Brexit. The decision was made by the psychopathic elite to fit their agenda and fill their pockets.
pro	All we want IS to get out of EU the sooner the better.
pro	All we want is British Sovereignty returned to the People.
pro	All you need to do is read the various EU Treaties (starting with the Treaty of Rome 1957 right through to the Lisbon Treaty) to see the absolute monster we've voted out of!
pro	All yours Boris, well done. Don‚Äôt let down the fishermen please. Let‚Äôs put the Great back into Britain
anti	Almost all UK chicken producers would be wiped out by Trump‚Äôs excrement-covered birds, but if any of them (farmers not birds) voted Brexit you can be sure that they knew wot they wuz vo‚Äôing for - the dole q.
pro	Almost all of the people where I work are Poles,, Romanians and Hungarians :(( only me and 1 other English person, It doesn't feel like England anymore :( I vote leave not because I am against immigrants, but because i feel that there is a limit to how many we can take
anti	Almost every multi-national corporation will move outside of the UK. Stupid ass idiots got duped into believing Brexit was for the best. Thanks Putin.
pro	Almost there, folks! #GetBrexitDone
pro	Already about 5 big Merchant Banks have announced investment in the City of London - and that's after Brexit. We had all these scare stories the first time around about not joining the Euro would destroy the City and Stock Exchange - it didn't.
anti	Already every bad consequence of Brexit or no deal has been blamed on the evil nature of the EU, it was inevitably going to go this way as their whole campaign to leave was built using the EU as a scapegoat for their own ineptitude and poor domestic policy decisions.
anti	Already, even before we have left the EU, Brexit is damaging our country, our economy, our society and our standing in the world - damage that will be worsened by the kind of ruinous no deal being pledged by some who aspire to become prime minister.
pro	Also, EU laws are passed by the European parliament, which is directly elected. Mind expanding on how laws are being dictated to you by an ‚Äòunelected‚Äô body, when they‚Äôre literally passed by a parliament? I suggest you ask yourself who‚Äôs really at fault for immigrants taking low wage jobs - the people trying to etch out a living, or the employers willing to take advantage of that?
anti	Also, had a friend who runs a Belgian inspired beer bar and thought there were to many immigrants, despite his bar being fully staffed by eastern Europeans. I don't think you'll get a rational answer to this. Edit: both cases are people who said they voted leave.I Being an EU citizen, I didn't really know too many people in that crowd.
anti	Also, polls show that the remain side is dominated by under 35's, with the leave side being significantly older. It's our generation that will be impacted by this decision, and unlike the xenophobic dinosaurs, we don't want to be stuck in a little Island with a wall built around it!
pro	Although I am glad about us leaving the EU on Jan 31st 2020, am over the moon with the non alignment with EU after us leaving, also with trade talks coming to an end at the end of the year, I am not happy as an ex serviceman with the government allowing Cobham to asset stripped.
anti	Although in theory, solving brexit‚Äôs challenges could help alleviate genuine problems the UK has, it probably won‚Äôt.
pro	Although leaving EU has a terrible consequences, but for me it may have promising benefits from it years after the leave itself--the UK may establish diplomatic relations and trade treaties to the commonwealth and other non-EU countries of interest, like Japan, Iceland, Norway, Chile or the Philippines to rebound their economic status
anti	Always said 'Industrial workers' voting for Brexit were Turkeys voting for Xmas
pro	Always united? We were never united even when we were part of the Eu! The only thing the Eu cares about is the UK taxpayer money. Good riddance.
pro	Am I getting a bit ahead of myself here, but does the prospect of leaving the E.U. without a deal look better and better?
anti	Am in England for #Brexit I genuinely hope people who voted for it DO NOT Suffer lack of medical resources Lose their jobs Lose their fishing rights Lose their families I hope it‚Äôs everything they wanted & hoped for because it‚Äôs going to be difficult and I wish you all well
pro	Am right behind you Boris , love your determination even after this past week !!
pro	Amazingly Switzerland has 5 borders with the EU without a hard border
pro	American has always sided with France at the cost of U.k since their revolution and WW2 When the French sent their gold too the U.S until after the war .They then left U.K to fight unill we were bankrupt after that at the very end of the war they finished the job we started and put us into moral and financial debt and at a distinct disadvantage....So in short don't trust them you mug's! VOTE OUT E.u-mess !
pro	American here wanting to wish you a happy Independence Day! Freedom and Security by Brits for Brits!
pro	Among working-class voters, Boris has an amazing 44 to 17 per cent lead over Jeremy Corbyn. No wonder Labour strategists are so dismayed by the prospect of an election.
anti	An Economic crisis is coming home.
anti	An act of economic stupidity based on xenophobia and Tory lies. The UK will rue this day! Hopefully Scotland charts an independent path back to the E.U. now that this Brexit folly has come to pass
pro	An earthquake would be appreciated in the heart of Brussels to raise that SHITHOLE to the ground preferably with the EU leaders in IT
anti	An embarrassing mistake. Great Britain will not be greater.
anti	An excellent piece by Stephen Bush in the New Statesman. On post Brexit business and companies betting against the UK economy. Perhaps an indicator as to the negative impact Brexit will have on the UK.
pro	An exciting new chapter opens in our country‚Äôs history - a refreshed opportunity to enhance our bonds and partnerships with nations across the world, advancing British values globally
pro	An exit deal with the EU is beneficial for both parties
pro	An impressive opening salvo from Boris. Keep up the good speeches!
anti	An insane amount of money that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of just how much Brexit has cost the nation so far.
anti	And Brexit is the mistake people never realised they made.
anti	And Brexit just keeps on delivering the manure. Brexiteers - it is ALL YOUR FAULT from here on.
pro	And I did get up in 2016 - to vote leave Brexit!
anti	And I thought the british were intelligent people....
anti	And Leavers think it's a good idea to leave the EU without ANY trade deals...
anti	And Putin gets another win in his book.
anti	And Putin's hold on continental Europe grows.
pro	And THAT to the remainers is why we wanted to leave the EU gravy train! We are their largest exporter so they shall kneel before us eventually
pro	And about going ‚Äòback to Europe‚Äô the UK is part of Europe and always will be - it just won‚Äôt be part of the EU numpty!
pro	And about time, we should never have signed away our rights in the first place
anti	And about to get a whole lot worse, as May is clearly stupid enough to trigger Art-L and go for a Hardshit Brexshit!
anti	And as regards all these EU laws and regulations that are supposed to blight my life, I have never come across any of them.
pro	And by September last year, more of England's councils joined in, once more celebrating Brexit by pouring raw sewage
pro	And for a little context ask yourself why these people want to remain?? business interests maybe? shares in places abroad?
anti	And from tomorrow onwards when we see Tax Rises, Cost of Food Rises ect ect, that is when we will regret leaving the EU
pro	And hopefully we then leave without a deal and it's a clean break
anti	And idiots completely fell for the lie that is Brexit
pro	And if Ireland enter our waters after Brexit they'll be cut off too.
pro	And just to think there‚Äôs people in the U.K. think this vile organisation is wonderful.
anti	And let's make the Rejoin campaign one of tolerance, decency and friendship
anti	And life gets that little bit worse. Does it ever get a little bit better? I‚Äôm struggling to remember but no, not under a Conservative government it seems.
pro	And many millions like me will be rejoicing at finally no longer being tied to the corrupt EU. The EU know we will be successful the reason they what to make it as difficult as possible to leave.
anti	And moreover Brexit will be a drag on every sector of our society. To make it a success would require a tremendous will and work from the entire population.
pro	And never look back. EU has lost control of its borders. It's not too late for England to protect hers.
anti	And now Scotland gets independence and we join back to the EU
anti	And now conservative has won (Boris Johnson) and now we are leaving .... i think.
anti	And now millions of people in the United Kingdom are denied the right to easily travel, work and attend school in other EU countries. And the currency's worth is at its lowest point since the 1980s.
pro	And now straight a Nexit!
anti	And so begins our long, great decline. Ring those bells. And light a candle for what remains of our little country.
pro	And so like 1642 and 1776, 2019 is a date that a free people will remember. That or war
anti	And so the nightmare begins
pro	And so what? Britain has a decision. For good
anti	And soon Scotland and Northern Ireland will leave the U.K. in response. The Kingdom is shrinking...
anti	And soon because of it there wont be a UK.
pro	And still the bitterness continues. I just hope none of you posting on here are business people cos with your attitudes to change, we really will be toast
anti	And stop presenting the EU as doing a no deal. The UK decided to leave, remember. All failings will be down to the leaderless Tories. Do t even try to blame the EU, you can try though.
pro	And that is why the EU will ultimately fail to deliver ever closer political and economic union, it's going to make Europeans poorer.
anti	And that's how Britain got screwed.
pro	And that's part of the reason were leaving. The arrogant europeans have very little appreciation or respect for how the UK helped shape the eu. Out and onwards and upwards. The eu has turned into a bureaucratic technocratic nightmare tying everything up in red tape to keep all of its jobsworths employed and destroying the productive economy in the process. And the euro is a straight jacket of disastrous proportions. Glad we're getting out.
pro	And the EU is no longer a trading union but has become a non democratic superstate, ruled by unelected far left globalists.
pro	And the Stop Brexit campaign continues. YOU LOST get over it!
anti	And the benefits will be...?
pro	And the blind remainers cannot see the way the EU treat the UK we are just Cash Cows out and stuff them and their cars Japanese are just as good
anti	And the breixt voters still think they know better. If brexit does finally go through then it seems that the first problem the government of the day needs to tackle is eduction for it is clearly in a catastrophic state if so many in the country will continue pursue brexit despite the truth being known about all the leave claims and the conduct that has been uncovered.
anti	And the famous Blue Passports ( which could have been printed anytime in the past) can now be printed by a French Company in Poland. The U.K. will more than likely have to pay tariffs on them as well. I think that in itself summarises Brexit !
pro	And the good news keeps on coming for the UK post #Brexit As Facebook plan a huge new HQ at King‚Äôs Cross and Apple build
pro	And the more the EU tries to hardball the UK, the more we are going to want to leave, and pay back the EU for its unfriendliness.
anti	And the truly staggering thing is that probably half the people who voted for Brexit didn't even realize that it would mean the end of the UK. I guess if you're that blinkered then you deserve everything you get.
pro	And then the PM decides that the vote was wrong and we‚Äôre still stuck in the same situation today.
pro	And there you have it ladies and gentlemen of the remain campaign. From his own mouth. How much more do you need to hear and see? Grow a pair! We need to leave!
anti	And they will loose all the benefits of open borders. At least I hope the EU will be strict in such cases and quits all treaties so the British people can FEEL that the EU didn't only wanted money of them and gave them a lot of economic advantages they will miss.
anti	And this time it's real. Any last minute ideas to #StopBrexit?
anti	And thus a decision was made that would massively screw over the country for years to come.
pro	And to think only a couple of months ago we had a paralysed parliament that could only agree to disagree! Boris Johnson winning the General Election on December 12th will go down as one of the most important occasions in the history of the United Kingdom.
anti	And tucking the people up along the way.
pro	And we are fed up with career politicians who have no experience of the real world
anti	And what happens to the millions of British people living, studying and working abroad? Imagine all the retired Brits in Spain coming back and claiming on the NHS.
anti	"And why are they ignoring their own assessments that any Brexit will leave us all worse off? The only outcome that ""betters the lives of British people"" is to Remain."
pro	And yet remainiacs told us that Britain would have to apply to join the WTO but would be vetoed by Argentina
anti	"And yet some Brexiters still believe that the UK¬†""holds all the cards""¬†and that the EU will capitulate and give it what it wants."
anti	Anger as Gove claims UK doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòneed‚Äô trade deal with EU
anti	Another American here. Sounds like that famous, European self-righteousness, smugness, and sense of superiority has rubbed off on you. Must be something in the water over there. No wonder the Brits want out
pro	Another article that fails to understand Brexit or what‚Äôs going on in the UK. It‚Äôs subjective that it‚Äôs pointless. We want to leave the EU and FoM etc. Don‚Äôt you get it? We want it for good reasons.
pro	Another brexit scare story put to bed
anti	Another company I worked for in 2018 many colleagues were made redundant and staff moved to Amsterdam and both companies said it was due to Brexit and uncertainty.
anti	Another global financial crisis is coming
pro	Another great British victory over Europe
anti	Another opportunity lost. This is what happens when you make plans to leave the world's largest trading bloc. Watch the Brexiteer politicians who sold this snake oil to the country yet again blame everyone and everything other than themselves.
anti	Answer: Don‚Äôt leave the European Union.
anti	Any #Remainer out there, don't give Johnson the satisfaction of TV ratings. Don't watch, Turn the TV off, who wants to listen to a snivelling, lying cheat.There is nothing to celebrate in my opinion.
pro	Any 'DEAL' means we're still IN !!!!!
anti	Any British citizens want to enlighten us on how exactly this is going to change things for you? No sarcasm or snark intended, genuinely interested in an actual participant's take.
anti	Any bad things that happen, even after the UK has left the EU, will still be because of the EU in the eyes of Brexiters.
anti	Any decent politician would now be saying that whilst it's clear many people voted to leave, we cannot reach an agreement that will truly be in the best interests of the country & bring the people from both sides together. We must therefore #RevokeA50, #Remain & reform within.
anti	Any evidence to support your rhetoric? Unicorns are not real BTW.
anti	Any financial forecast is guesswork from either side. I think you've got to Base this on what sort of person you want to be, insular and fearful of outsiders and collaboration, or open and willing to help and work with others. I also do think you have to look at who is campaigning on either side, if you want to align yourself with Nigel Farrage and Michael Gove then you get what you deserve.
anti	Any form of Brexit makes our security harder to manage.. The harder the Brexit, the greater the damage.
anti	Anybody thinking a no deal is good is just ignorant on economics and trade. The British can not be trusted and the world is watching on how they conduct themselves.Who would do a deal with this backsliding country.
anti	Anyone aged over 50 must not be allowed to vote in the referendum. It is not their future to decide.
pro	Anyone else fed up with the propaganda from these Common Purpose led political clowns?
anti	Anyone else feel like we are in the set up of another world war
anti	Anyone else find it interesting that LEAVE voters type like TRUMP?
pro	Anyone in their right mind should vote to leave the EU political union, we want their trade, not their politicians and policies.
anti	Anyone know the collective noun for a group of elderly, racist #brexit jihadists?
anti	Anyone now supporting a 'no deal' Brexit is a threat to my family, business and the country. It's becoming quite clear that they are prepared to accept any degree of damage to the UK and its people, including loss of life.
anti	Anyone surprised ? Weaker country, weaker currency How anyone thinks the we can get a better trade deal than the one we have just given up, is beyond me.
pro	Anyone who opposes Brexit is a fascist
anti	Anyone who supports Brexit is an idiot
anti	Anyone who thinks brexit will help trade is a moron, if India wanted anything we have they could buy it already, cutting the cost of British wine by 5% isn't going to do a god damn thing
anti	Anyone who voted for brexit should be sent to a mental asuylm then be shipped off to prison for 3 life sentences to be served back to back for crimes against the people of the UK
pro	Anyone who wanted to stay in the European union should emigrate to a another country that has remained in the EU theres plenty more of them
anti	Anyone who wants a no deal is someone who will make a lot of money at everybody's expence.!
pro	Anyone would think that UK hadn't survived for hundreds of years without the EU. Trade is much more global now and the politics of the EU are anathema to a freedom loving country. Do your worst Globalists, UK will be the first to leave, will it be the last? I think not. Time will tell.
pro	Anything is better than bowing down to a bureaucratic super state that hold democracy and individual freedom 2nd to their dream.
anti	Anything is better than brexit.
pro	Anything that hurts the EU is a good thing.
anti	Anything that reduces the cohesiveness of the European project is something that the Russians have been pursuing. It is a divide and conquer strategy that they are implementing. The people in the EC are only now getting around to figuring it out, too little too late.
anti	Anything to help his mega rich donors. Brexiteers can‚Äôt seem to see what is obvious to everyone else. The EU were a bulwark against U.S. type capitalism, it was a force field that the extremist right in this country despised. You reap what you sow, you‚Äôll soon find out exactly what Britannia unchained is all about for you and your family personally.
anti	Apart from the racism and the loss of EU funds and the further loss of jobs in Wales, the Midlands and the North and the collapsing pound and the further unemployment everything is coming up roses.
pro	"Apart from the traitor and war criminal Tony Blair, Theresa May has become the most hated PM in this decade. If she forces another eu referendum she can count me out, as I will NOT vote again as I already voted to leave, and my vote is still the same. I hear people crying on the streets of Britain, ""Off with her head""."
anti	Apparently the Tories refuse to accept reality. Either that or they actually WANT to destroy the country.... which I hope is not the case but I suspect it is.
anti	Apparently we have lots and lots of opportunities being outside the EU. Such as...?
pro	Apparently you're not allowed to court-martial your paperboy any more if he forgets your Daily Star. Yet another reason we need to #getbrexitdone
anti	Appealed to their most base instincts - fear and racism
pro	Are Remainers just going to moan forever and then when Brexit is a great economic success still maintain they were right and we just got lucky? I think so.
anti	Are leavers just pretending not to know that we‚Äôre in a transition period where nothing changes or do they genuinely not realise? #Brexit
anti	Are the Brexit muppets even aware that when they talk about their country being the fifth largest economy in the world they are stating they are from India.
anti	Are the English seeking to become a part of the U.S.? Are they willing to drop the monarchy? Why are U.S. flags flying lower than British flags? It seems they fell victim to the same thing the u.s. did. Unaddressed problems solved with the worst possible solution. We have trump, they have those other dumbasses. The Daily Show made a joke, if this were a movie it would be obvious. Those dudes with crazy hair are aliens and are trying to mess you up. Interesting times.
anti	Are there any real pro brexit arguments that aren‚Äôt about tax avoidance or hating the foreigners?
anti	Are we about to see the greatest brain drain in history?
anti	Are you asking brextards if they voted for brexshite
pro	Are you in or out? Does the UK really want to be governed by people that are unelected?
anti	"Are you seriously this ignorant? You've let this ""can't happen to me"" bullshit get in your head. Brexit shouldn't impact me with any significance either(as far as I can tell) but the way things are going it's going to fuck a lot of people. If you can't recognise that reality, you are very fucking naive. It's not out of character, Leave voters seem to be oblivious to the fact that their decision is going to literally cost some people their lives if we crash out of the EU."
anti	Are you speaking on behalf of those UK businesses dealing with EU partners
anti	Are you sure you want to take away the rights of free movement, throw away trade deals, put unity and stability of EU at risk and jeopardise the integrity of UK?
pro	Are you willing to put on a Yellow jacket and take to the streets if the 29th of March isn't the date we leave the EU in essence #Brexit #UKIP
anti	Around 3.5 million British jobs are directly linked to British membership of the European Union‚Äôs single market ‚Äì 1 in 10 British jobs.
pro	As BREXITEERS, we just want what we, the majority voted for! I have never wished harm on any remainer..they are entitled to their opinion but have to come to terms with the fact they were out-voted!
pro	As Brexiters leaders promised, UK has just signed 40 new Free Trade Deals and NHS have started to recive the extra ¬£50M per day.
anti	As Britain has declared its intent to become a total outlaw country, the black market will thrive and the legitimate economy is finished
pro	As Churchill famously stated in Parliament in 1953 We have our dreams and our own task. We are with Europe, but not of it.
anti	As I predicted - Brexit is going to be one phuck of a train wreck.....
anti	As I say goodbye to another friend this week leaving the UK for a job in the EU I am still at an utter loss as to why we are doing this. There are no benefits in my mind in a world where we need allies and friends across the world to combat climate change. It makes no sense to me and the hate filled comments and gloating of the leavers makes it unbearable.
anti	As Nissan scraps plans to build their X-Trail model in Sunderland, I'm reminded that 61.3% of people there voted for Brexit. And this is how some of the idiots celebrated. I'll be saving my sympathy for people who deserve it.
pro	As a Brexiteer I must vote this biased analysis down. You didn‚Äôt even try.
pro	As a Brexiteer I say good. Nobody wanted May's pathetic deal and she couldn't be trusted to get us out of the EU.
pro	As a Brit living in the Netherlands, Britain really will benefit long term with a No Deal Brexit. Expect Italy or even France to follow in due course while the Brits get out their popcorn.
anti	As a Brit, Brexit breaks my heart.
anti	As a Brit, I see the UK situation as just as embarrassing as the US situation. It‚Äôs possible to laugh at both.
anti	As a British person...... I can say with confidence that I hate British people. I am sorry for all those that have to put up with us Britons
anti	As a British person...... I can say with confidence that I hate British people. I am sorry for all those that have to put up with us Britons üòÇ
pro	As a British tax payer why should I subsidize countries in eastern Europe and why should they lose all their professional elites to us. The EU is not working.
anti	As a British, after Brexit, we are not free to travel in Europe, I hate Brexit.
pro	As a Chartered Engineer, I can assure you we're well skilled to look after UK's engineering needs.
pro	As a Commonwealth Citizen from Singapore, I exercised my right to vote and I supported Leave.
anti	As a European l have to say goodbye and good luck being Trumps sock puppet. You only have yourselves to blame
pro	As a European who studied and worked in London for a total of five years with many friends on the island, I am bloody proud of the people taking the stand for Brexit. It is a great part of getting the Sovereignity back. I can only hope that my country one day will take the same decision. You have defended European countries and shedded blood in two disastrous wars for freedom. You are now taking a stand against EUSSR. You are too big to bully!
anti	As a German I am fully prepared to help the Irish. We're a union, not a ramshackle political garbage dump, and unlike such a dump we keep our promises.
anti	As a Scotsman, I voted yes for independence and no to Brexit
pro	As a U.K. citizen Im sick of being shafted by the EU. If they want a level playing field then STOP putting demands on the table before negotiations begin.
anti	As a UK citizen living in the EU I'm terrified of this outcome as I haven't lived in the UK for almost a decade. They would literally have to drag me kicking and screaming to return there.
anti	As a UK resident I find Brexit insane...people were not informed properly and we all need a second chance #votestay#voteagain
anti	As a UK resident/tax payer but Swedish citizen I can't vote today. But I can show where I stand. I'm in. #VoteRemain
anti	As a brit, Brexit makes me feel sick. Still an EU citizen at heart, wish I could be labelled European British
anti	As a citizen of the Czech Republic, I'm so for the idea of a bigger political organization where everyone is equal. I'm not saying I want Europe to be one country. I just wish people realized that all European nations have so much in common and that together we are stronger.
anti	As a continental I am relieved to see that the gullible Brexiteers are in the minority and the British public can see through the lies and false media
pro	As a developed country, I don‚Äôt think we need to accept EU financial integration. This is obviously a disadvantage for us.
pro	As a diehard Brexiteer I say: leave means leave! Don't let door hit you on way out!
pro	As a eurosceptic I'm delighted at how piss poor the 'Remain' campaign are. All they have is scaremongering, near enough all of it 'the sky will fall in' by laying out the worst case scenario.
anti	As a historian I fear Brexit could be the beginning of the destruction of not only the EU but also Western political civilisation in its entirety
anti	As a law student, we're staying IN !
pro	As a lifelong Conservative voter, I am appalled and disgusted by this abject surrender by Lord Halifax..., sorry, by May, to the EU bullies. At least the USA has a leader that stands up for his own people and country. May and her gang of traitors have betrayed the British people yet again. Whether it's Brexit, multiculturalism, islam, crime, defence spending or half a hundred other topics that vex and dismay the people, you can be assured our smug self satisfied political elite will subvert or ignore the people they supposedly represent.
pro	As a part of the younger generation I'm NOT sad about this. So relieved to be out of the anti-democratic, protectionist, corporate bureaucracy that is the EU. We're a free global nation again, not locked away as a prisoner in fortress Europe. Hello USA, Hello China, Hello India, Etc. :D
anti	As a pro independence Scot, I am fully backing remain, despite a successful leave vote potentially triggering a new independence referendum here. Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are all being polled as strongly voting remain. This is England's referendum and the rest of us are being dragged along for the ride. The leave side is also using similar arguments that they condemned the Scots for using in the independence referendum which is mildly infuriating. Examples include Nigel farage crying out for the Queen to intervene in the Scottish referendum and in the past few months he has criticised Prince William for giving a pro EU speech and the 'no' campaign in Scotland for independence called the yes campaign xenophobic and racist towards English people and yet here we are ripping on immigration and foreigners. Nations historically always blame immigrants over addressing wider issues - Nazi Germany, Chinese blaming foreigners for Hong Kong protests, Red scares in the US being blamed for strike action etc. This is nothing different. As someone said to me the other day, the immigrants didn't crash our economy.
anti	As a pro-EU person I acknowledge that Brexit Britain will be fine. Well, at least depending on what ‚Äúfine‚Äù means to you. If ‚Äúfine‚Äù means ‚Äúno doomsday‚Äù, like people starting dying in thousands and unemployment jumping to 50%, then I agree, there won‚Äôt be any doomsday. But economy will take two hits, one stronger short-term hit and one weaker long-term hit.
anti	As a remainer I'm not looking forward to what the future holds
anti	As a remainer, I accept the result but I would vote remain again. Simply because the EU does not effect my life negativity. I am still yet to hear anyone explain to me why the EU is so bad and how it affects their lives negatively. Yes, I‚Äôve heard all the same sound bites and regurgitated headlines but no explanation of how that is effecting peoples lives directly. Hope it all works out.
anti	As a resident of the UK, I am so pissed off with this country. The sadist part of me wants everything to be so shit we finally get a proper change in government. I hope this blows up in our face. Maybe I'm a sore loser but I really don't care. I'm ashamed to be a UK resident.
pro	As a small business owner who believes in British democracy, but mostly as a father #IVotedLeave ‚ÄúI am not afraid of the future.‚Äù
anti	As a spectator on the outside, looking in - and as a US Citizen - I'd argue that the economic costs pale in comparison to the political cost both the UK and the US have suffered as a result of the strong conservative upraise in influence in-both respective nations. We have lost strength of clout and influence on a global scale and neither country is seen as politically stable nor reliable.
anti	As a strong believer that Brexit is a very damaging mistake that becomes more obvious every day, I see sound democratic reasons for asking the electorate to confirm what it wants to do.
pro	As a young Briton, there is no better choice than to leave the European Union.
pro	As a, leaver, immigrant( who never got any hate apart from from #remoaners who labelled me racist and xenophobic without knowing me & therefore showed THEIR racism) I'm proud of my adopted country taking back its own destiny.
anti	As always, the uninformed poor (as in the mafia bank$ter$ '08 ongoing crash) desperately grasped at an anti social Rightard straw - and got a sub prime-Brexit!! Good only for even more mafia bank$ter$ - like Farage!!
pro	As an American I cannot express how pleased (and rather impressed) I am with the Brexit party and the entire affair.
anti	As an American this is incredibly painful to watch...and I feel certain I can speak for large numbers of my fellow countrypersons when I say I am so, SO sorry you guys are having to go thru this.
pro	As an American, I just hope they can escape article 13, for their own sake.
pro	As an American, even I can see this is biased. I support Brexit, a country who doesn't want to be part of a collective deserves to be free should the citizens say so, and the citizens have said so. We did it in 1776, you guys are doing it now. Well, you're different, but we're sort of like that. I know a lot of Americans support Brexit, and I hope this follows through.
pro	As an American, it's good to see our British brethren do what's best for their country and break free from the chains of the EU and globalism.
anti	As an American, the UK leaving the EU has always struck me as stupid and odd because it would be like Michigan trying to leave the United States economy. Why would Michigan ever think that's a good idea for them to cordon themselves off from the rest of the U.S., all in the name of keeping out people from Minnesota and Indiana? Strange and futile, indeed.
anti	As an Aussie I can‚Äôt stop watching these videos. Brexit is like a slow motion car crash that you can‚Äôt look away from
anti	As an EU citizen, I am disappointed that the UK does not want to work together. It's a we want but do not give mentality, where all parties can only lose
anti	As an European I always looked at the British people and culture with appreciation but when I see the comments and argumentation of the majority of the Brits here I realize how wrong I was. Some are complete imbeciles
anti	As an European, i think it is very stupid. Brexit shouldn't happen and they should stay with us.
anti	As an Irishman I‚Äôm really sad that the UK is leaving. Best wishes and you‚Äôre always welcome back.
anti	As an Irishman and a proud European the words Boris Johnston and genuine do not go together. In my opinion it‚Äôs all games and showmanship with him and worst he is playing with the Irish peace process and ultimately risking peace and people‚Äôs lives.
anti	As an Irishman in the UK I now have more influence and opportunity than a british citizen. I can vote in your elections and live and work anywhere in the EU. What have you gained?
pro	As an aside, I wonder how many people who voted for remaining were scared into that vote by the economic fear factor that turned out to be pure fiction?
anti	As an economics student, I can confidently say that almost everything I've read from the leave campaign, at least from a financial standpoint, has been a huge mistake at best, or at worst they are just plain lying to the people. Add on the fact that we will need to keep open borders if we want access to the single market, and I cannot see any reasonable reason to vote leave. I'm not suggesting the remain campaign have behaved entirely reasonably either, but many of their claims have at least some evidence to back them up. Edit: Should've figured this would strike a chord. I'm not claiming to be an expert, just throwing my opinion out there, feel free to disagree. Edit 2: John Oliver has said it better than I can, I encourage you to watch the following video: https://youtu.be/iAgKHSNqxa8
pro	As an individual there is one thing I can do for the country on June 23rd Vote Leave, and I will do.
anti	As clear as mud! The vote that gave the U.K. Brexit is the same kind that gave the U.S. Trump. Clueless people talked into mindlessly deciding something in their worst possible interest.
pro	As dyed in the wood Brexiteer, had best breakfasts in Germany got many friends whilst working there fer 15 plus years,am a HARDEND eu hater,but Germany was OK just the eu mafia is the problem,just saying
pro	As far as I know, the UK pays more money to the EU than what it gets back
pro	As far as I see it they are trying to bully us. We have helped save their lives, and poured billions into the development of Europe. Yet they are manipulating and coercing us now.
anti	As far as Johnson is concerned brexit is now all about avoiding scrutiny at any cost
anti	As if Brexit was an economic vote, give me a break. It was a hate-filled xenophobic vote and that‚Äôs it. The older generation would rather see its own kids and grandkids deprived than married to gasp an Eastern European. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not really white, you know.‚Äù That‚Äôs all it is. The fact that we‚Äôll live worse doesn‚Äôt matter to any Brexiter.
anti	As it goes on so it becomes more frightening. The Brexit debate may reflect the troubles of Europe, but it is also unleashing something far worse. What utter, utter folly.
pro	As it stands I‚Äôm voting to leave, Cameron will have to to come up with something very special for me to change my mind
pro	As long as Britain leaves the EU Customs Union and Single Market, then it can forge free trade deals with countries around the world
pro	As long as Britain leaves the EU Customs Union and Single Market, then it can forge free trade deals with countries around the world.
pro	As long as we leave on the 29th March 2019 making sure we can make our own laws and negotiate our own trade deals the conservative party will retain my vote.
pro	As members of the EU, we're all colonies. They might describe us as Member States now, but the EU is aiming to become an Empire with Germany as the sovereign state.
anti	As much as I think UK is foolish to leave Eu.. they are an independent country .. EU has to make an example out of UK seriously????? Wtf .. EU looks like a butthurt baby ..
anti	As right as the picture is, now we should peacefully raise our voices for a 2nd referendum.
anti	As someone from Ireland, I'm terrified for my relatives up in the North. What happened to the Good Friday agreement that was promised? The bloodshed is going to come back and it's all your fault
anti	As someone from OS , the problem is not the EU, it's the laws and set up in this country that essentially discriminates against and fails to protect the lower classes. Simple stuff like being forced to pay the real estate fees and land rates for rental properties, elsewhere the landlord pays for that, it's their property. Pay day loans with extortionate rates, elsewhere these are illegal. Road taxes are high, insurance costs are high; people need a car to work but can't afford to have a car. Fix the basics and empower the poor and the country prospers...but I'm guessing the upper classes wouldn't like that???
pro	As someone living in the EU, I think EU are being real dicks about this instead of accepting that Britain wants to leave and treating them fairly. It seems the EU is just trying to fuck the British for no other reason than to set an example for other countries who might consider leaving.
anti	As someone who has worked for the UK government in its economics departments; on paper voting leave is simply ludicrous from a financial point of view. I shall be voting remain.
anti	As someone who is from the UK, I think we should definitely stay. I know that the EU is not perfect but I know as a fact that leaving wont make it any better for us.
pro	As someone who lived a number of years in Europe, including in the U.K., I congratulate Nigel Farage and the Brits on regaining their sovereignty and FREEDOM from the clutches of Brussels. Best wishes to the United Kingdom from TEXAS!
anti	As the Tories take us out of the EU on the hardest terms, they're risking our jobs, our security and trashing the cooperation of the past 50 years.
pro	As the UK is justly leaving the anti-democratic EU and is formally in the transition period, the argument to remain is empty. That is, remainers are now an extinct species: You cannot argue to remain in something which we are in the process of formally leaving. Therefore, the tribe which used to identify as remainers has split. The remainers which accept democracy are now leavers and those which do not accept democracy are rejoiners (?), or just malcontents, or something along these lines. Taxonomy is at play.
anti	As the date of the official political farewell nears (29 March 2019), some activists are talking about halting the process, mainly due to the frozen negotiations between the EU and the United Kingdom regarding trade, travel, security, and other areas.
anti	As they said it's very easy to leave the EU, but what you will do after is the difficult part
pro	"As this glorious event sinks in....it is wonderful to hold our heads up high and pronounce we are a Proud Nation again! Whatever the future holds, it will be a future that is decided by the citizens of this ""now again"" Great Britain! Our grandparents will be proud!...their legacy is secured!"
pro	As to a British exit from the EU. That cannot come any sooner. The EU experiment is crumbling, borders are being flagrantly disregarded by all and sundry and the leaders of most every country within have little to zero answers to the solution.
anti	As was said at the time of the referendum, the people were lied to, inflamed with migrant issues............!!! In consequence we have shot ourselves n the foot!! Don't blame the EU.....the blame lies squarely with the instigators: Cameron-----a woeful decision to call the ref., purely to keep the Tory Party together, Farage, Bojo, Gove, and May and co. for perpetuating the diabolical shambles!!
pro	As we leave the E.U., the U.K. can turn its back on the austerity policies that have been the hallmark of the euro area.
anti	As well as this I have lost my identity, not just as a European, but as a Brit
pro	As you might expect from the Guardian, much of these so-called facts in this study are way out of line and highly tendentious. Even BBC's Newsnight recently reported studies showing that the UK could grow at up to 8% per year if out of the EU. Not a word of it here.
anti	Ashamed to be British. A country lead by Boris, Farage, Gove and Duncan Smith is not where I belong.
pro	Ask yourself this question: If it's so great being in the EU, Why would the EU be scared that other countries might follow suit?
pro	Astonishing poll is packed with good news for independence supporters The most important caveat about all of the results
anti	Astonishing that Leave journos still peddle the myth that there could have been a successful, prosperous Brexit.
pro	At 11pm tonight, Britain will leave the European Union. After more than three years, we can finally say that we have delivered on the result of the 2016 referendum and have kept faith with the British people.
pro	At last some sense in Parliament and at last some hard ball tactics from the UK. Now stick to your guns, not deal, no money. Why has it taken 2 1/2 years of total unrest and business insecurity to reach this point. This should have been our position day one.
pro	At last someone with a backbone! They shouldn't get a penny unless Britain gets what it wants in return. AND we want our fishing waters back too. If they want to make a trade agreement that is purely about tax and customs, fine, but that's absolutely all it should involve. And as for MORE money that the EU are talking about - it should be 3 billion at most and then we want our assets we've paid into returned as well. Time to stop letting them think they can walk all over us!
pro	At last the road to freedom! Free from packaging regulations! Free from EU flight compensation rules! Free from data protection!
pro	At last we are starting to push back on the EU. Tell them they can go whistle for the ¬£39billion.
pro	At last we can move forward. Today is not about leaving Europe it‚Äôs about not being governed by Europe
pro	At last we can rule our own country & make our own decisions. I've waited over 20 years for this!
anti	At last we have left! Now the deluded brexiteers will finally have to wake up and experience reality.
pro	At last we‚Äôre leaving the EU. What a magnificent and historic day. The voters of Britain have defeated the Remoaner establishment and defended democracy itself. This is the most stirring political achievement of the postwar period
anti	At least Brussels has never taken us to some unjust and illegal wars, or imposed the unfairest tax imaginable!
anti	At least my taxes are paying to keep you all alive to see the catastrophic results.
anti	At least that can only last eight years. Brexit is permanent.
pro	At least the people will have some voice and not be ruled by appointed Belgian overlords...
pro	At least we can relax, knowing we will be free from being used as a dildoby the EU, who masterbateUs every day to get as much bodyfluid out of us as they can.
pro	At least we can save a lot of stupid membership fee
pro	At least with all the EU rules removed we can freely go to our local abottoir, and kill a few livestock on site and feed the masses. We can also use up all the wonky non EU veggies, not throw back all the EU illegal fish.. We'll have an abundance of food #Brexit #Nodeal
anti	At no other time would Brexit have happened, either before or after. It was the unfortunate configuration of the arrogant, lazy and cowardly Cameron who called the referendum, Theresa May with an obsession with immigrants and clamping down on them whatever the cost, and a would be socialist, still living the 1968 Student Union bar uprising, who sees capitalist evil everywhere.
anti	At some point in the future it will sink in to even the dimmest Brexiteer that leaving the EU was a big mistake
anti	At the end of the year we have become Third World citizens
anti	At the moment our defence and security rests on Nato, not on the EU, but the EU adds to that security... Why should we leave?
pro	At this moment. Leave the EU without a deal in March 2019. UK GOV PETITION 186,781 signatures Stop Brexit 68,400 signatures SAYS IT ALL LEAVE MEANS LEAVE
anti	At this point I'm hoping you back out and stay in the EU.
anti	At what point has it been a good idea? I seriously think we need another referendum.
pro	Aussies wish you all the best in your decision to leave. Hope it is all that you wish it to be.
anti	Austerity hasn't ended. There will not be 40000 new nurses. There will not be 40 new Hospitals. 20000 'New' police officers is still below pre 2010 levels. No new money for the North. You fell for a great big Con just to get #Brexit done
anti	Australia-style‚Äô Brexit agreement means no deal
pro	Awesome!
pro	Awesome! Definitely a historic moment. But they could only give this 26 seconds?!! Aren't most TV commercials longer than this?
pro	Awesome. The McGuiness witch is a rude ass. I would want to leave too. √∞≈∏‚Äô¬Ø√∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç√∞≈∏‚Äò¬ç√∞≈∏Àú≈Ω
anti	Awful hope things change and people wherever they are from who live and work here feel welcome again
anti	BBC This morning on Brexit. Michael Gove tangible benefit of Brexit 'Gives us the opportunity to 'level up ' the north. Huh? is that it? You could have done that 5 years previously while a member of the EU. Deceit and double talk from the Brexit govt.
pro	BBC and Sky have not let us see many Brexiteer MPs in front of the cameras in the past three weeks, just plenty of wishful remainers fantasising and grandstanding and ignoring the legal requirement to exit on 29 March if no deal is agreed, most of them female career politicians from all parties suffering from verbal diarrhoeiah. What a change to hear the simple commonsense and inescapable logic of the actual position we are in !
pro	BBC is so fake news. They continue to promote stories that Remainers were in majority. Why does Brits have to pay license fee to support such leftist propaganda.
pro	BBC spreading fear even now. Bye, bye EU, and hopefully soon, bye, bye BBC.
pro	BEST PM EVER KNIGHTHOOD FOR NIGEL
anti	BIG EXPECTATIONS FROM THE UK
anti	BIGGEST mistake we will ever make, we are dependent on the EU to function, well done to all you jobsworth BREXITEERS who do not have a clue about politics, we need Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband to take over this mess and have Corbyn as travel secretary and finally the honourable Dianne Abbott as the secretary of state, she's brill.
anti	BOZO claims he will unite the country, just another of his blatant lies. He is the last person who could do this. Even Farage or Widdecombe would have a better chance!! The majority in UK are now pro-EU and we will never yield to the Toffs, the fascists and the ignorant who are currently in control.
pro	BRAVO Boris ! üí™üá¨üáß BREXIT üí™31 JANVIER 2020 üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
pro	BRAVO, England. I didn't actually think you'd end up leaving so I was thrilled when I awoke that morning and heard the news. Independence. It's great. Now get back your rights to free speech, freedom of religion in the public square, and most importantly, your right to bear arms.
anti	BREAKING: The wilful ignorance and lies of those who promoted passing Brexit will now be adopted by those running Brexit. Weren't EU countries UK's biggest trading partners last week? Just checking for a friend...
anti	BREAKING: Theresa May scraps... Brexit! Now THAT is the headline we want to see‚Ä¶

anti	BREXIT WILL LEAVE BRITAIN POORER
anti	BREXIT has no definition every single brexiteer has their own definition, you voted for something you didn't understand that's the most dangerous thing about democracy I hope this is one backward, expensive lesson for everyone who voted brexit
anti	BREXIT has profound implications for almost every aspect of UK life - and the science and technology industries are no different.
pro	BREXIT is a good way to get out bad news
anti	BREXIT is a madness
anti	BREXIT is a madness. It was just an empty political scam.
pro	BREXIT is not a problem its the vile EU
pro	BREXIT is the best thing that could have happened the the UK. The EU is a total joke.
anti	BREXIT is the biggest fraud perpetrated in this country to date.
anti	"BREXIT makes Russia GREAT again . UK out of EU will the "" THE ENEMY "" All media will worl to destroy the IMAGE of Britain in the continent . UK will be ISOLATED . Trade with UK will be TABU . COLD WAR ... BUT NO PANIC ...UK has GOLD ( robbed to other countries ) to survive few years more"
pro	BREXIT means Breakfast, gald its done and dusted, onto a better Britain
pro	BREXIT must happen. Democracy must be upheld and outside the EU the country will thrive on the road of freedom!
pro	BREXIT no deal option and no payment bring it on then watch the eu implode as many nation's want out that haven't been given a vote
anti	BREXIT shows that the British electorate and government can be played and manipulated by bad actors posing as Nationalists as much as the next countries.
anti	BREXIT will be disastrous. Why cannot others see this fact. There is no going back to the good old days when England was a Great Nation, no matter what all the leavers think, wish, dream etc. England is not a major world power or player. Good luck on trying to stand alone.
anti	BREXIT without a deal is going to hurt both EU and UK but undeniably UK will be the one much worse off. In the end it will strengthen EU because it shows the folly of throwing a tantrum and leaving.
pro	BREXIT, The Victory Day. Congratulations Great Britain !
anti	BREXSHIT boring now everything will come out in the wash.
anti	BREXSHIT is a ploy to crash the UK economy so the rich can buy up land, properties, business. The rich despose of us when ever they went. All the modern problems in the world are do to the rich

VOTE OUT
pro	BYE EUROPE
pro	BYE UK :D we don't want you in UE, so happy after the result
pro	Back stop? Excuse ? Get out of the team if your not interested in being a part of it.
pro	Back to independence¬†üá¨üáß- we should never have joined the EU in the first place.
anti	Bad
anti	Bad deal for both. But for the EU, the chaos in the UK is a small blessing disguise. It allowed Barnier and his team to have the upper hand in the negotiations, making the EU look like a united front for once.
anti	Bad for UK end of
anti	Bad idea
anti	Bad idea awful execution
anti	Bad idea.
anti	Bad idea...
anti	Bad. We left the EU In control of our armed forces and intelligence services.
pro	Bank of England Governor admits there are risks to staying in EU. Safer option to #VoteLeave and #TakeControl
anti	Barclays has just been granted permission to shift 190 billion euro of assets out of the UK. Not sure that was on the side of the bus.
anti	Barnier rattled the EU's sabre. Johnson twanged the UK's butter knife!
pro	Barnier still doesn't get it. It's the EU that needs the trade deal. We can manage without and keep our fishing grounds
pro	Barnier,Junkner,Tusk three really good reasons to be away from the cesspit called the EU
anti	Basically Brexit was a big waste of everybody's time
anti	Basically boris man bad
anti	Basically brexit is like negotiating for 5 years to move to the house next door which is virtually identical. Utter waste of time.
anti	Basically, we didn't like a few laws that the EU imposed... so instead of trying to fix them... we just rage quit.
pro	Be a Churchill Mr. Johnson don't be a Chamberlain..No retreat, no surrender and no backing down to the EU dictatorship!
pro	Be a sovereign nation or be dictated by some unelected bureaucrats in Brussels. I'd take the 1st part.
anti	Be brave Mrs May say in sorry but we can‚Äôt deliver brexit as it would devastate the country
anti	Be rational and vote IN
pro	Bearing in mind that we were deliberately lied to about loss of sovereignty when we joined the then Common Market
pro	Beati loro! Gongratulation UK! üá¨üáß
anti	Because Brexit is objectively a bad idea.
anti	Because exactly what the UK needs is a smaller group of dickheads with bad ideas who have even less opposition to their bad economics policies. English people you disappoint me
anti	Because naturally clientelism and nepotism are absent or have always been absent of british politics.
anti	Because over half the U.K. population (including Scotland) are anti-Brexit too - Even in the most recent Prof Curtice‚Äôs What UK Thinks Poll of Polls. And the You Gov 26/1/20 poll.
anti	Because stupid people, old people and racists vote too. Same problem in the USA. And Putin laughs.
anti	Because the political class is absolutely useless and though we would just sleepwalk into voting remain.
pro	Because they want to lock us in, we're a cash cow for them and a nation they can dump the Eastern Europeans on.................Lets not forget they've already stated they want to allow 4 more nations in and we know where they'll be heading!
anti	Because we didn't want you to leave, in the end it would have been so much better for both of us to stay together. ;(
pro	Become independent just like America did
anti	Been in France for 1 day. Drove 600 miles with no roadworks, everything clean, hotel staff delightful, food perfect, wine incredible, everyone seems to care about their country. We need to be closer, not further away from this amazing place
anti	Before entering the European Union, UK could not buy even oil
pro	Before the referendum, the EU wanted Britain to take more refugees. Leaving the EU would allow Britain to regain control of its borders.
anti	Before the unnecessary referendum we were fine. High employment rates. Free movement. Austerity caused by British government impositions following 2008 global economic crash. Electorate blaming that on EU. Level of ignorance astonishing.
pro	Before we joined the Conning market our growth was 2.4% we had full employment affordable housing no waiting for doctor's appointments social housing for those who deserved it an NHS coping with demand and we took orders from nobody.....Over 40 years later and 100 Billion Pounds lighter ......Now look at us!
anti	Beginning of the end for the UK...EU membership issue swung a lot of voters in the Scottish Indy Ref.
anti	Beginning of the fall of the EU, HA! More like the beginning of the fall of the UK
pro	Being an independent nation not ruled by a collective of other countries does have its benefits. UK did well before the EU and I think they'll be ok post EU.
pro	Being anti EU is not the same as being anti European. Just like being anti Fifa is not the same as being anti football. The EU is corrupt. We are not leaving Europe or the EEA. Just the corrupt EU
pro	Being in the EU destroys countries by removing their national sovereignty.
anti	Being in the EU is vital for our generation. So proud that my uni is backing Britain remaining in Europe #StrongerIN
anti	Being in the EU, Great British startups are entitled to an EU match funded grant. This can bring an additional ¬£250,000 to each startup.¬†After Brexit, we will lose this. Brexit is a disaster for startups!
anti	Being outward-looking & forming alliances is what makes our city & country so great. #EUref #StrongerIn
anti	Being poor and voting to leave is like Uncle Tom giving up the fine clothes to go back to picking cotten
anti	Being supportive of Brexit is a marker for a wide-range of LESS-EVOLVED ideas, concerns and expectations. Brexit is an anti-intellectual movement. Boris has worked out how to speak to these people. As a young, asian, educated professional Londoner, I feel worried about the future. In fact I am making plans to leave Little Britain....
pro	Being tied to the same organisation that created the Euro crisis, the migrant crisis, the banking crisis, the mass unemployment crisis & the democratic deficit crisis would be the hight of stupidity.
anti	Being unified by Europe helped smooth the divisions of history, how can Brexit be anything but a return to division regardless of a hard or soft border?
pro	Believe in Britain, free, sovereign, democratic, global and strong.
anti	Believe it when it see it, I just worried about what you are going to give away to get Brexit.
pro	Belive in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything. Just do it! #brexitmeansbrexit
pro	Best day of my life. Finally left the establishment.
pro	Best decision for democracy, well done Britain, from an Irish person. we all know how EU democracy works here in Ireland, how people quickly forget the Lisbon treaty disgrace
pro	Best decision in the last 5 decades...bye EU, and hello Europe!
pro	Best thing about this is watching the repulsive BBC-Eurotrash getting more and more upset with each successive result. A roughly six hour trip from smug to distraught that was a joy to behold.
anti	Best thing education did for me was to make me realize how uneducated I was about a vast majority of things. I don‚Äôt want someone as smart as I am to be in charge. I want someone far more intelligent to be in charge. Trump and Johnson seem far less intelligent than I, and I don‚Äôt know shit about international politics. I do know shooting ourselves in the economic dick is a bad idea, though.
pro	Best to vote to leave Britain was a Superpower once remember
pro	Betrayal, betrayal! No, no one can blame the British for leaving this European Union. A united Europe no longer makes anyone dream. A European Union which has put itself at the service of the global bankster barons, instead of representing the best interests of the Europeans trusting them. The United States, China and Russia use OUR Europe as a puppet, not to say prostitute. They laugh in secret at the incapacity (or corruption?) of our elit‚Ç¨$, because for more than 10 years, these elit‚Ç¨$ have betrayed the interests of us Europeans, by selling our continent to international corporations. They instored crimeocracy, fueled by greedocracy. All these criminal activities skillfully hide an important fact from us, the peoples of Europe: United, under a competent and honest elite, Europe would be THE WORLD SUPERPOWER which would negotiate on an equal terms with the United States, China and Russia and, if necessary, could impose its conditions and standards. Juncker, Merkel, Macron etc. should not be honored, they should be brought before the judge. Europeans, wake up !
pro	Better a brexit now than something worse down the line.
pro	Better by far to trade with people who love us rather than the people who hate us.
pro	Better poor than slave! Freedom has no price!
anti	Better reject the notion of leaving the EU. It's part of Russia plan. Break up the EU, UK and USA.
pro	Better to be free and independent rather than part of the collective. Sorry socialists. You've always got venezuela.
pro	Better to govern thyself that be a slave wariness dried pickles and onions- after so tine pickle taste great and so does onions ....yes the unkonwn is tough and scary but one must remain brave
anti	Better to stay in the EU dawdling along, annoying the federalists but gaining the benefits of membership until a more evolutionary process brings the EU and UK to a better relationship.
pro	Between the union and the eu. I choose the union. Not both!! 2nd ref... no change for me. Maybe it's cause the Indy ref only happened before the brexit vote.
anti	Bexit is a nonsense in a world increasingly dominated by the big boys: the US, China, the EU, and the rising economies of India, Brazil, etc. Any influence that we had was because we were part of the EU. Who will¬†listen¬†to us?
pro	Biased media and fake news. If uk is strong and confident, no need to worry for anything.
anti	Big Ben was too expensive so we get an recording with a projector. Says everything about brexit.
pro	Big Mr Rothschild and his ilk can lord it to us from on high about how we must obey and vote to remain in the EU. The only voice I will listen to is the ordinary man and woman on the street whose wages are being pushed down through competition from migrant workers, and the desperate Steel workers in Port Talbot who are told EU rules prevent us from giving state support to help their industry, etc etc etc etc etc. IT'S TIME TO LEAVE THE EU. VOTE TO LEAVE - IT'S THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO FOR OUR FUTURES!!
anti	Big big mistake..
anti	Big mistake
anti	Big mistake!
pro	Big mouth, zero solutions - calls other exactly what he is. Do you job Nigel, do Brexit. I advise all to look into article 24 on Brexit.
anti	Biggest mistake UK ever made. Let‚Äôs hope a general election reverses the the stupidity
anti	Biggest mistake the British have made
pro	Bit late on this. should have been done 25 years ago, Oh and maybe they should add criminal background
anti	Black Saturday in UK history
pro	Blind beliefs to let unelected eurocrats rule over Europe and have unelected EU Commissions make regulations who cannot be ousted by the people is a terrible idea. The new Elite Class of Europe live right there in Brussels with overpaid public service jobs who arrogantly dismissed British concerns and interests for decades. Britain joined the EU decades ago for a trade union, not to give up all national self-governnance and control to eurocrats and 27 other countries. Unprotected borders, letting in dangerous people and unlimited immigration, overburdening schools, hospitals, housing has been a disaster. The excessive EU regulations and being a member of the corporatist, globalist EU has cost Britain billions of pounds per year. Leaving the EU wil save the UK billions of pounds, to make free trade deals with any country in teh world and become great like the free and rich country of Switzerland outside the EU.
anti	Bloody Brexiteers don't care if they destroy us all because of their xenophobia :(
anti	Bloody idiots, dont know whats coming
pro	Bloody love love lovvvve you Boris üá¨üáßü•Çüçæü•Çüá¨üáß
pro	Blow them out of the water! Rule Brittania!
anti	Bluntly, the economy will be damaged by people who won‚Äôt live to see what they have helped do. That‚Äôs just not funny.
anti	Bo Jo's withdrawal deal is full of holes. Should have been No Deal, clean Brexit.
anti	Bojo is a complete fool and will go down as worst prime minister ever and that‚Äôs not to mention his unwanted and unwarranted sexual advances towards women. No brexit up Corbin
pro	Bollocks I cannot wait Come on BREXIT AM NOT PAYING MY MONEY FOR EU ROMANIA IN EU THIS IS CRAZY NO WAY they are the most corrupt country in this planet,how they are in EU??????? Never come on brexit
anti	Bollocks to Brexit - the real fight starts soon, make sure we are ready
pro	Bollocks to the EU
anti	Border Protest as Brexit Begins: Brexit does not have the support of the people in Ireland.
pro	Borders will be more secure with no deal, not less. Bring it on.
pro	Boris !! for the first time in decades, I am impressed and feel optimistic for the future of a British nation, onwards and upwards, do not take one step backwards. !!!!!
pro	Boris I am with you
anti	Boris Johnson & the Tories appear to be in the process of ruining our country and economy and continuing to pretend that there will be no problems with Brexit and our country will do wonderfully well outside the EU! Johnson is pursuing a very hard or perhaps even a disastrous No Deal Brexit and this will have major negative consequences for our economy, public services, livelihoods, security etc!
anti	Boris Johnson going to break up the United Kingdom
anti	Boris Johnson is a shameful, selfish man who is only interested in himself. Look at his eyes in this clip. He knows he is talking nonsense, but he's doing it anyway because he thinks he can become PM on the back of Brexit hysteria. What a scoundrel.
anti	Boris Johnson is a twatt
anti	Boris Johnson is about to find out just how weak the UK is after Brexit. Britain small. EU massive.
pro	Boris Johnson is awesome. Although everyday he comes out on TV, his hair looks like he just woke up lol! Congrats on Brexit
anti	Boris Johnson is so delusional, typical British. It will be fun when you realise you will have to pay us to trade with the most successful trading bloc in the world. Good luck selling your assets to US. It will be super fun to see you crying because everything was privatised. The common uninformed Englishman truly deserves that.
anti	Boris Johnson is the fourth horseman of the British Apocalypse.‚úåüòÅüòÜ‚òùÔ∏è
anti	Boris Johnson sabotaged Theresa May because he wanted her job, and the only way to get it was to push for a total madman's Brexit
anti	Boris Johnson threatens to pull plug on any EU trade deal if it means following Brussels rules
pro	Boris Johnson won a massive landslide victory in a general election. #GoBrexit
anti	Boris Johnson's Brexit is opposed by 2/3 top Brexit parties. Boris Johnson's Brexit is opposed by 250K leave-voting unionists. Boris Johnson's Brexit is opposed by 2/4 countries of UK. Boris Johnson's Brexit is opposed by the 53% who voted for 2nd referendum parties. #NotMyBrexit
anti	Boris Johnson‚Äôs Brexit bill has cleared its last hurdle after the government overturned 5 House of Lords amendments, including one restoring the right of unaccompanied child refugees to be reunited with their families in the UK.
anti	Boris Johnsson is a wanker
pro	Boris The Lionheart! Thank you very much PM. Overwhelmingly wonderful.
anti	Boris and Raab are just going their usual tub-thumping gaslighting routine. U-turns, re-interpretations, pre-accusations of mal-intent, divide-and-conquer at home and abroad. And pre-conditioning the masses for the blame game. Same old, same old.
anti	Boris and his gang of idiots also seem to be labouring under the misapprehension that because they won an election in the UK with the help of their friends in the press, that they will also be able to do the same thing with negotiations with the EU
pro	Boris and his team are correct, we are out of the EU and will not take their diktats any longer!
pro	Boris and his team are correct, we are out of the EU and will not take their diktats any longer! That‚Äôs because‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. Brexit=Freedom
anti	Boris doesn't have the competence to be PM for long. Brexit is a disaster, and the UK economy will be damaged for years afterwards.
pro	Boris got Brexit done...
pro	Boris has a vision and he's a winner. WTO will do just fine.
pro	Boris has achieved, what looks like a great deal for the UK
pro	Boris has unveiled his canons and fired a distancing shot! Good speech! Determined, clear but cheerful and reasonable, he makes Barnier sound very last century.
pro	Boris is a boss. The British will decide who fishes in their waters. Not the EU.
pro	Boris is an articulate, jovial, and lovable character who's childhood hero was Sir Winston Churchill, listening to this speech we can see and feel the impact that this great gentleman has had on this young man.
anti	Boris is at his strongest when he‚Äôs waving kippers around to wrongly accuse the EU of creating red tape that originated in the UK.
anti	"Boris is behaving like a dictator. He fancies himself a Churchill, but he's a pale shadow. ""Grow up"" he says, I say he needs to look in the mirror. The worst PM in British history, a liar even by politician standards who only won an election by lying through his teeth and exploiting a broken system."
anti	Boris is leading this country into a dark unknow future no deal brexit will lead to mass job loses factory closing down and go to an eu member country to save pay tariff food shortages nhs drug shortages and mass debt on people
pro	Boris is the messiah who will lead us out of the EU
pro	Boris may have his faults and has turned his back on N Ireland but Brexit for the UK is the best thing at this stage.
anti	Boris must knows that we can't have the Butter and the money of the Butter...French proverb. And the EU it's not ONLY a market.
anti	Boris said Brexit was done. It's not really though is it? And it could go on and on and on and on. Never ending talks no less....
anti	Boris still claiming he will get get a great deal with no concessions which is nonsense, he caved in on the WA and hw has nothing to bargain with except fishing. Given how little we actually earn from fishing they should be the first thing on offer and it will really upset that numpty Farage has bonus value.
anti	Boris the coward didn't even venture outside No 10 last night.
anti	"Boris wants Britain to be ""Singapore on the Thames"". A one party, authoritarian state. Instead, one generation from now, England will be America's European Puerto Rico, eating genetically modified foods, chlorinated chicken and hormone-laden beef. Then, when they get sick and fat from all their American food products, they‚Äôll have the ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù to pay outrageous medical costs in the by then privatized NHS. Freedom in the neo-liberal lexicon means freedom of the strong to predate on the weak. Free Trade is a particular example of this. A rational person must expect the UK to be brutally savaged in dealing with the EU, US and China."
pro	Boris was brilliant, he was unifying and UK first. Only a biased, prejudice fool is not able to truly listen to the words spoken.
pro	Boris will deliver exit. Farage is a amazing political talent, I like him very much. You are the Lucky Brits. My country will never leave, it‚Äòs due to her history: sigh ;).
pro	Boris will go down along with Churchill as the greatest PM this country has ever had. What a time to be alive. I've had an extra spring in my step these last few days.
pro	Boris you are a breath of fresh air, Patriot of this great nation. we are fully behind you never surrender to the EU.
anti	Boris's Brexit Britain. The UK will be begging for a bailout from the EU within months.
anti	Boris, how about FREE SPEECH, in Britain!
pro	Boris. Get it done at the very least 17.4m people onside.
anti	Borris Johnson said, the UK will not comply by EU standards on social protection or environmental regulations. Well, I guess the UK better get ready for high tariffs and boycotts of its goods and services.
pro	Borris you got the job done. cheers üçª
anti	Botched Brexit followed by a hard left Corbyn government. Just disastrous really.
pro	Bottom line is many countries are outside the EU and they are doing just fine
anti	Brace for the recession, fellas
anti	Brace yourselves for tough times ahead. Those negotiations will not be easy by any means. The EU will ensure the UK is taught a good lesson so other member states do not dare to follow lead! .
pro	Bravo United kingdom!!!!! You did it, you have your independence back!!!! And your democracy back!!!!!
anti	Breakfast, not Brexit. Everyone will be happier.
pro	Breaking up the nation states sounds like a grand idea, but the alternative that presents itself, global governance, seems much, much worse.
anti	Breixters will be telling us it's all in our heads, after 3 years of evidence and expert opinion on how things are going to go for many years at the least.level 2
anti	Breixters: The people voted! If we don‚Äôt follow through on that vote, democracy is a farce! Remain: We could just vote again now that everyone has more information and many are changing their minds. Wouldn‚Äôt that also be democracy? Brexiters: The people have spoken! No take backs!
pro	"Bremoaners should be considered as being ""Virtue Signalled"". Rather like being Stockholmed. A vote for remain was a vote for Dictatorship. I ask Is the Juncker Reich virtuous?"
anti	Bretards won't believe anything.
anti	Brexcists seem to think that voting for this shit-show will somehow magically insulate them from its effects. Still, I'm sure they'll find a convenient scapegoat to blame for the mess they caused.
anti	Brexin. Remain is the sane option.
anti	Brexit & Trump are like the best and most tragic shows of 2010-2019.
anti	"Brexit (and Trump) happened because around 80% of people are not very intelligent. Winston Churchill:""The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter."" But I don't blame them as much as the scoundrels who promote the brainwashing/ propaganda that feeds the fears of these simpletons. Fox 'news', The Daily Mail, The Sun etc work for the wealthy while scoundrels like Farage, Johnson, Gove, Cummings et al also do their bidding. The fact that so many working class voters see billionaire Trump and Lord (snooty) Rees Mogg as 'one of them' is so pathetic as to be almost funny. Almost. #sad"
pro	Brexit , or death
pro	Brexit , or death.
anti	Brexit - A terrible decision.
pro	Brexit - as good as it gets.
anti	Brexit - something that never should have been put to a referendum. A lose/lose for the UK and the EU. Another foreign policy win for Vladimir Putin.
anti	Brexit - they thought it was all over! No, that was the easy bit, now the tories face the real test. Can they diverge from EU rules AND get a trade deal? Can they stop border checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK? Can they hold the UK together? Can they find the money for HS2? Will Boris lie down in front of the bulldozers at Heathrow or will he just continue lying? Interesting times ahead.
anti	Brexit 2016 was a chaotic vote, held at the height of lies deliberately perpetuated to misguided gullible , who still believe in the its glory! But it is a titanic that will sank England to a greater depth!!
pro	Brexit <3
anti	Brexit = Britain has no leverage in trade negotiations. And will be desperate to sign deals. US will firmly demand NHS as part of any deal. Our politicians want your politicians to let our pharma and for-profit health care industries savage your country and grind every last quid out of the British. If you think you can't squeeze blood from a stone then you have never dealt with US health care and pharma industry. I post this everywhere but here goes My 2020 health insurance plan: $21,250 annual premium $5,000 annual deductible $45,000 max annual out of pocket If that sounds great then you will love Brexit. If not, you need to figure out how to cancel Brexit.
pro	Brexit = Freedom
anti	Brexit = Stupidity
pro	Brexit = the British Crown/Queen wanting it‚Äôs independence back from Brussels... Remain = the Rothschild Euro project/banking system trying to stop anyone from leaving their euro-scam... We = the dumb, brainwashed c*nts bickering about it all amongst ourselves, like we know what we‚Äôre talking about!.. WAKE UP!!!
anti	Brexit = the most pointless exercise, ever.
pro	Brexit Britain Makes Britain Great Britain Again
pro	Brexit Britain Makes Britain Great Britain Again üá¨üáß
anti	Brexit Britain is Desert-Britain. There is no medicine, no food, no money! Northern Ireland, Scotland should leave as soon as possible before the Brexit destroys own country and people.üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±
anti	Brexit By the way its pronounced with a Sean Connery accent - Breksh!t
anti	Brexit Day +4 The grounded planes, the chaos in the streets, the unpaid workers, the crippling strikes
anti	Brexit Day, now upon us, feels like the end of hope, a moral collapse, a self-amputation that will make the country where I grew up poorer in every sense
anti	Brexit Destroyed UK. we want #SecondReferendum
pro	Brexit It's the best thing for Britain. And many other EU countries would be better as well if they leave like Germany for example
pro	Brexit Must come.
anti	Brexit Politicians couldn't run a bath. They would however tell you its full, when it's empty.
anti	Brexit Stinks
anti	Brexit UK. The mouse that tried to roar, but squeaked instead.
anti	Brexit a desaster for the UK.
anti	Brexit absolutely must be delayed... Nah, kicking the can down the road will solve nothing. Brexit must be cancelled.
pro	Brexit advocates share one single common trait: they can only imagine the very best of all possible futures for Britain.
pro	Brexit ain't broken, we're leaving in March. If we don't then democracy will be broken.
pro	Brexit allows us to subsidise and nationalise industry
anti	"Brexit always was about ""unnecessary economic damage"", and dismantling the UK. Why are they discovering this now?"
anti	Brexit and Trump voters are the same. Dreamers manipulate by the rich elite.
anti	Brexit and Trump. The gifts that keep on giving and letting racists and small minded bigots think that their actions are ok and justified üòí
anti	Brexit and it's associated world view are embryonic fascism that has now metastasized, aided by English passivity and cowardness
anti	Brexit bad
anti	Brexit benefits? None. None whatsoever.
pro	Brexit best thing ever happend to our country
anti	Brexit best thing ever happend to our country.... not!
anti	Brexit biggest mistake in UK history!!
pro	Brexit by name only. I said it all along!!! I knew what I was voting for. I wanted a hard clean cut. I stand by it more now than I did then
anti	Brexit can be summed up in 2 words. Complete stupidity.
anti	Brexit can only go badly. There's nothing in this politics but bad news for anyone. The Leave camp has been thoroughly deceived. Not a single one will get real enough about their project to cost it. So thee is no limit to what it will end up costing us all.
anti	Brexit cannot happen, if it does, then it will be such a colossal human tragedy. All the families split up. All the businesses shut down. The kids growing up without access to Europe and vice versa.
pro	Brexit could actually be a great opportunity given the massive organizational shifts that are to come globally in the next decade
pro	Brexit could be a really positive thing, It will allow the 'Europeans' to get on with integrating their countries and creating a new superstate as they clearly want to do.
anti	Brexit could be the beginning of the end.
pro	Brexit could bring us more money and less loss.
anti	Brexit could have very worse effects on England economy.. :((
anti	Brexit could potentially lead to the breakup of the UK, an unintended consequence possibly but one that is on the horizon. Northern Ireland is very unhappy with the deal because it creates a customs border with consequences there that could end with them splitting from the UK or violence. The Scottish National party gained a lot of ground in the last election which creates the atmosphere in Scotland for independence
anti	Brexit could very well lead to the end of the UK, or even of Great Britain.
anti	Brexit day means nothing except that the people who orchestrated this scam can now line their pockets whilst they negotiate trade deals outside EU. Let's celebrate!
anti	Brexit day showed again there's so much ignorance and racism among Brexit supporters, even though we're told we're not allowed to say that to shut us up. Our job now is to work out how to combat it especially when Brexit and Tory rule will make ordinary people's lives much worse
anti	Brexit day. A sad day in UK history. #leavealighton #LookAfterOurStar
anti	Brexit day? I call it doomsday.
anti	Brexit deals will NOT make up for lost EU business.
anti	Brexit decision is a disaster!! Email/tweet your MP and demand another referendum! #StopBrexit
pro	Brexit delayed is Brexit denied. The British government lied.
pro	Brexit does not translate into leaving NATO, Europe or the EU. Just like Switzerland has close ties to the EU, so will Britain
pro	Brexit doesn't mean the UK is going to cut it's mooring and drift a thousand miles away into the Atlantic, we're still europeans just not a part of their silly political project.
anti	Brexit doesn't seem very well thought though.
pro	Brexit doesn‚Äôt need fixing. We voted Leave. No Deal would be fantastic for the UK. All that is stopping it are treasonous politicians who do not want to obey the will of the electorate. Either we leave on schedule and get what we voted for or democracy is dead.
pro	Brexit ensures that the money the UK previously sent to Brussels will be spent as the UK decides.
pro	Brexit establishes the sovereignty of Britain.
pro	Brexit excellent excellent excellent excellent kill remainer rats
anti	Brexit fools. If the UK leaves the EU the FIRST thing that will happen is that the UK will lose its influence as a financial centre.
anti	Brexit for UK is a disaster economy.
pro	Brexit for the win, bollocks to the EU üá™üá∫ globalist elite
pro	Brexit gets better every day.
anti	Brexit gives me the same feeling of moment to moment dread and powerlessness one feels being in a car with a shit driver
anti	Brexit good for the EU? Right, sure, say what you like
anti	Brexit guaranteed to be a calamity
pro	Brexit had better go ahead unless they want a riot
pro	Brexit happened because of uncontrolled migration over forty years which changed the country beyond recognition and alienated the majority of older working and lower-middle class white voters whose votes tipped the balance in favour of leaving the EU. Pretending otherwise is now a niche industry for centre-left spin doctors in training.
pro	Brexit happened because the E.U. treated the U.K. worse than a foe conquered in military conflict. They charge us a fee for trading, just like the Mafia changed businesses, they stole our fisheries, putting thousands out of work, they forced immigration upon us, compelling us to financially support families in other countries who would never live here. ONLY enemies usurp a country's sovereignty in this way. TRADING PARTNERS never do this. The E.U. is a criminal enemy to the U.K. and it is high time that this was recognised by our politicians, and they are treated as such. We owe them nothing. They owe us ¬£billions for the years they have mistreated us. Bankers, businesses and Socialists, those who benefit from the E.U. at the expense of our people should hang their heads in shame for not supporting our country!
pro	Brexit happened because years of complaints from British governments from both parties that the union was obsessed with integration etc were completely ignored. It used to be a great little trading club but then started to get involved with things that were nothing to do with trade. We complained for years and were ignored. So guess what? We left.
anti	Brexit has a new meaning, it now means........ LEAVE BRITAIN, LEAVE THE UK.
anti	Brexit has actually been a quite good advertisement for the benefits of the EU.
anti	Brexit has allowed the UK to be almost entirely governed by the right wing parties. I have never been more ashamed to be British in my entire life. Now Scotland and Northern Ireland must show defiance to where the UK is going and leave before we have a Trump like character running our country too.
pro	Brexit has already created a new industry. Remainer salt mines! We need to get exporting that sweet sweet salt.
anti	Brexit has already made Britain poorer, weaker and meaner
anti	Brexit has become a tale of woe, capital flight of the order of 800 billion Euros has left the UK because of Brexit.
anti	Brexit has been a disaster for the UK, France and Spain. It is a dream that will become a nightmare for other member states as the wealthy states begin to remove their support.
anti	Brexit has been about nothing but the Tories putting their own electoral survival ahead of the interests of the country.'Getting Brexit done' was just a euphemism for 'keeping the Tories in power' and if that means throwing the country under the bus then so be it.
anti	Brexit has been initiated. This is a sad day for Europe, for The European Union and above all, for The United Kingdom.
anti	Brexit has been lies from start to finish. But you know what? Let's have Brexit. On 1 condition: OWN IT. Stop blaming EVERYONE else, stop blaming the EU. This was going to be the best & easiest thing ever. OWN IT.
anti	Brexit has completely reset the U.K.s image and reputation. Now it is bracketed with Kaschinski's Poland and Orban's Hungary as a country taken over by narrow minded bigotry, nationalism and xenophobia pandered to by a new government to that is a mixture of chancers and ideologues leading it into penury and isolation.
anti	Brexit has defined the death of colombia, and that will bring horrible problems to uk.
anti	Brexit has enabled and normalised racism and xenophobia and the worms have crawled out from under their rock .
anti	Brexit has made Brits `angrier' and `deeply divided'
anti	Brexit has made me ashamed of my country.
anti	Brexit has many downsides, but I think it will be nice for the Irish to watch a British famine
anti	Brexit has never been a fundamentally awful idea... but the way it‚Äôs been handled and the people who have been negotiating have been nothing short of catastrophic
anti	Brexit has never been about Britain first. It's always been about a small grain of shady business people first. If anything was Britain first it would be staying in the EU.
anti	"Brexit has never been advocated by what it would give to average Britons, but rather by what it would take from the ""others"" like the EU, eastern Europeans, and ""brown people""."
anti	Brexit has no worthy objectives and no likely positive outcomes
anti	Brexit has proven to destabilizing. The right wing is cancer not only here in america but to all nations around the world
pro	Brexit has saved Britain from EU immigrant hell.
anti	Brexit has screwed over the British people yet again.
pro	Brexit has strengthened the EU, Thank you England!
anti	Brexit has suckered millions of people into a situation where: -a UK government has wasted
anti	Brexit has suckered millions of people into a situation where: -a UK government has wasted ¬£130bn - enough to DOUBLE
anti	Brexit has taught me that a lot of people who apparently went to the 'school of life' and the 'university of hard knocks' think they are just as capable of understanding the economic and trading complexities of Brexit as those who went to real universities to study those things.
anti	Brexit has to be painful. Maybe then the UK will learn and rejoin. Leavers got what they wanted, it sucked and now is time to go back begging to the EU
anti	Brexit has turned into an absolute disaster.. We are the laughing stock of the World!
anti	Brexit hasn't even happened yet, and it's already a disaster
pro	Brexit helped us get rid of the rules set by Brussels, some of which even overturned British law.
anti	Brexit in UK, Trump in America, AfG in Germany, The League in Italy, Front National in France, DPP in Denmark, Democrats in Sweden, Freedon Party in Austria and Netherlands. Are these Alt-Right movements the beginning of the end of Western Civilization as we know it?
anti	Brexit in any form is going to mean job losses, recession and inflation it's just a matter of how many , how long and how much. We're leaving something we've been in for 40+ years , millions of people have moved countries, thousands of businesses have set up trade links, combined research, agencies,............. If you don't think this isn't going to cost you're not thinking.
pro	Brexit is Brexit. No Deal Hard Brexit is what the people of UK voted for and UK Parliament has to deliver. Just get on with it and sort it out.
pro	Brexit is Brexit.. YEAHH WERE OUT! GLORY TO UK!
anti	Brexit is British pride and arrogance.
anti	Brexit is Putin's dream come true - he wants to destroy all of the western countries and alliances.
anti	Brexit is a Trumpian move. Instead of working out a solution that does not isolate the country as a whole. Brexiters should know that Britain is no longer an empire thus it needs allies.
anti	Brexit is a bad idea. 'No deal' Brexit is lunacy.
anti	Brexit is a bad idea. Sometimes I hope a hard brexit will happen so that people will actually understand that it does more harm than good, then sometimes I hope it just doesn‚Äôt happen at all.
anti	"Brexit is a cancer not a plague. No one is going to delay food and medicines entering the country. On Brexit fools day the gutter press would be full of pictures of well, normality under ""Project Fear"" headlines. Over the following days and months Project reality would start to kick in. For example the government would have to choose between 40% price increase on imported food or unlimited free trade with the whole world. It is difficult to see the Government choosing 40% food price increases so imports from the rest of the world would increase and prices of food imported from the rest of the world would go down. Without massive government subsidies British farmers would become bankrupt and we would become totally dependent on food imports from the rest of the world. I take no comfort from the fact that British farmers were more strongly in favour of Brexit than the rest of the country. No Brexit is the only good Brexit. Most people, electors, farmers, car workers and Parliamentarians wish to stay in the EU. Let‚Äôs take back control, save a couple of billion a week and send the Letter of Revocation."
anti	Brexit is a cancer, not the plague. The UK economy will not implode on 30th march. It starts slow, with lower investments and new businesses who would have choosen the UK, but will chose now one of the EU27 to build a business in europe.
anti	"Brexit is a catastrophy. Britain has re-achieved its ""little island floating in the sea near Europe"" status. No thanks to the little no-brainers who voted for it."
pro	Brexit is a certainty. I voted ‚ÄòLeave‚Äô and the government promised to implement that decision.
pro	Brexit is a chance for British people to make a correction to everything - democratic, economic,social corrections,

anti	Brexit is a complete disaster! The most ridicules referendum ever
anti	Brexit is a con which takes rights, protections and freedoms away from the British public and offers them nothing in return. We all deserve better.
anti	Brexit is a crime scene. To come together is to accept that. No thanks. You own this. You also own all the chickens that will now come home to roost.
anti	Brexit is a death sentence to the party that sees it through.
anti	Brexit is a death spiral led by people so deluded they behave like extremists. A rational government would have done the risk analysis before triggering Article 50 and concluded that a soft Brexit, Norway model would have been the sensible course to take. I can't face a life supporting a country that has elected to get poorer over the next decade. I don't want to have children growing up and paying for Brexiteers mistakes. I think we should all think very seriously about getting out while we can.
anti	Brexit is a delusion, before it really becomes effective you will have economic melt down in the UK and then you will see the clueless politicians May and Corbin running like headless chickens

anti	Brexit is a disaster for the UK and will continue to be as well.
anti	Brexit is a disaster for the UK and will continue to be as well. We live in a globally connected world now and those most able to adjust and play the game win. You can‚Äôt insist on petty nationalistic ideologies and economically thrive anymore. UK will realize this the hard way.
anti	Brexit is a disaster for the UK but it's what the people voted for. And even if they didn't know what they were voting for how can that vote be set aside. But really, truly leaving the EU is really, truly damaging.
anti	Brexit is a disaster, Italy won't be real about its debt, and the European Union is in trouble.
anti	Brexit is a disaster. All you're arguing about is different levels of disaster! If only there was a way to avoid this Brexit disaster? Such as stopping Brexit? It's not impossible to avoid this disaster, is it?
anti	Brexit is a disaster. Stay in the union. Hold another vote before a hard Brexit. Do not be stupid you pack of old lards.
anti	Brexit is a disgusting series of lies at every turn. Admittedly the lies led to a one percent majority in an advisory referendum. But from the money for the NHS to the easiest negotiations in history, this hi-jacking of democracy is just that.

anti	Brexit is a fiasco of epic proportions, however many other countries are also unhappy with the with way the EU is run by Brussels. Forget Brexit it‚Äôs never going work, forget Remain it just wrong for our nation. We should get together with other member states and push for EU REFORM.

pro	Brexit is a huge win for the British and exposes globalism for the centralized control scheme it is. My hopes are that The UK does so well the rest of the bloc will leave as well.

anti	Brexit is a scam
anti	Brexit is a scam and a massive mistake. That I always thought was a terrible idea and holding a referendum on it wasn‚Äôt a good idea.I see no tangible benefits with plenty of downsides to it. I firmly believe that the best place for the UK is being a committed member at the heart of the EU and it is a shame that so many British people fail to see that.
anti	Brexit is a scam, a coup against democracy. In five years when the coffin dodgers who voted Boris Brexit are dead there will be restorative justice. Retribution. And we will join Schengen and the Euro.
anti	Brexit is a scam, pure and simple. Good for elite toffs as they believe it misleads the ultra foolish.
anti	Brexit is a self-inflicted wound; the people of this country hold the knife, and they don't have to use it if they don't want to. The people, not the hardline Brexiteers, are in charge.
anti	Brexit is a shit storm, it clearly isn't working out for anyone and the British are going to lose more than they gain and i think that they should just revoke article 50 instead of waiting for something to happen
pro	Brexit is a step forward for our nation.
anti	Brexit is a stupid and reckless act by small-minded British people desperately clawing on to some mis-remembered notion of sovereignty.
anti	Brexit is a stupid idea and it is not going to work without a great deal of unnecessary pain to the economy.
anti	Brexit is a stupid idea driven by xenophobia and chauvinism and I don't know any Remainers who feel differently. This country has made a disastrous mistake and ordinary working people will pay for it through job losses and reduced living standards and savage cuts to public services. Of course, a few disaster capitalists will get very rich. Must be rubbing their hands at the prospect of slashing workers rights, health and safety and environmental standards.

pro	Brexit is a symptom. Its not going anywhere however the wn -kers in parliament wish it would . It has been brewing since 1642, 1776 and 1974 . 2019 is just another outpouring of a free people to regain that which has been taken. By violence if needs be.
anti	Brexit is a terrible idea. There is no good way out of it. They should drop it for sure. It is just as bad as the US electing Trump.
anti	Brexit is a vampire, sucking the nation's life blood. But the earth turns on. And 2018 is the year in which the Brexit vampire will meet the bright sunlight of reality.
anti	Brexit is a very stupid thing on Britains part. Its opened up a can of worms with Scotland & Ireland leaving the UK. The economic effects & costs will be horrendous. Privatized health care, shortages, financial collapse & lord knows what else.
pro	Brexit is a victory for the British over the multinational corporations and globalist elites who want to enslave the rest of Europe in their 4th Reich project.
anti	Brexit is a victory only for Trump, China and Russia...
anti	Brexit is a warning what happens if one's ego and IQ are inversely proportional
anti	Brexit is a waste of time since leaving EU would put us in debt.

anti	Brexit is about to be cancelled. The leavers are dwindling in numbers. Sanity spreads among the English for every day that passes. Its simple, you can not govern a nation by pleasing a ill informed mob.

anti	Brexit is an absolute disaster and will make us all poorer
anti	Brexit is an absolute disaster and will make us all poorer. Voters are not experts and the referendum was just a silly mistake to begin with. It's the ignorant leave voters/no dealers who simply don't understand the negative ramifications of this mess.
anti	Brexit is an economic suicide!
anti	Brexit is an expression of english selfishness. Brexiteers don't give two hoots that two nations of the uk voted against; that it threatens the GF agreement that solved the mess the english had created in NI; that it threatens the post war order in europe. They don't give a shit
anti	Brexit is an ugly family heirloom that you secretly want to ‚Äòlose‚Äô in a fire but you‚Äôre too scared of offending your older relatives to admit it.
anti	Brexit is an ugly thing, spearheaded by ugly men with ugly intentions
anti	Brexit is an unmitigated disaster and I loathe and detest Cameron‚Äôs lazy, incompetent, irresponsible and ignorant approach to the referendum
anti	Brexit is an unmitigated disaster for the UK.
anti	Brexit is an unmitigated disaster for the UK. During the past 45 years within Europe we have increased our prosperity, security and vibrancy as a nation state. London has become the Capital of Europe, The Big Apple of the EU in much the same way New York is for the rest of the USA. I am ashamed of the 52% who voted to take us out. Demographically these people were older, less well educated, less economically active and from the racist and bigoted elements of our population. Outside Europe our economy will suffer and these elderly and/or economically inactive can expect smaller and smaller pensions and crappy health and social services and dwindling benefits and social security levels as things deteriorate over the next 2 to 3 decades. These people will suffer first and most as the jobs go. The jobs are going already. We just lost an airline (Monarch) with 2100 jobs because of Brexit uncertainty. Banking job movements to other countries have already started. Dozens of companies planning to move operations to the UK have cancelled the plans. Finally, the real reason that many UK citizens voted for Brexit was racist. There was a belief that too many foreigners were coming to the UK. This belief was most common with the elderly, the uneducated and the ignorant. It was a nasty and racist and pointless backlash against all the economically mobile, hardworking and useful people who were coming the UK and who have kept our economy warm since the financial crisis. This is an unprecedented case of the population of a major economic power being allowed to grab hold of the rudder and then steering the whole lot of us onto the rocks to sink. What a load of Bollocks. STOP BREXIT NOW!!!!!!!!!!
anti	Brexit is an utter and complete failure either way. At best it'll be miserable. When will these dilettantes and con artists held responsible for this utter mess they created in the UK, costing the UK tax payer many billions already with absolutely nothing to show for it. The exodus of high caliber business is accelerating.
anti	Brexit is and will continue to be lies and fantasy nonsense, blaming the EU and remainers and taking no responsibility whatsoever. Johnson is playing to the domestic gallery, relying on the stupidity of many of his supporters and believe you me, many of them haven't a clue. This was predictable.
anti	Brexit is another worrisome sign of the European drift towards right-wing ideologies spread by demagogues taking advantage of the bad economic situation of many.
anti	Brexit is as bigoted as ‚Äúthe wall‚Äù chatter here, and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre citizens have to endure it as it‚Äôs not ‚Äúgrowing pains‚Äù but shrinking your access to the rest of Europe. I just cannot see that as a good thing. The new taxes and passport mess, pretending this will keep ‚Äúforeigners‚Äù out... the job losses, down swing of the economy.
pro	Brexit is awesome.
anti	Brexit is bad for PR and development. Nobody wants to study or move to a greatly diminished Britain. US universities will happily outcompete UK unis for those students.
anti	Brexit is bad for the UK and Europe
anti	Brexit is bad your country. And with Britain being our Papa. us Americans feel bad for our paps. Really though, we couldn‚Äôt care less as it doesn‚Äôt effect us.

anti	Brexit is bad. Immigrants make Britain great. They also cooked your food
anti	"Brexit is becoming a national joke. No longer the ""will of the people"", with Beregret increasing day by day, we are laughing at the mess that Tories are making of it or we would be if it wasn't fucking the country. Brexit is bad for Britain."
anti	Brexit is beyond criminal. Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings are criminals. They will go down in infamy.
pro	Brexit is bigger than the Conservative Party. Brexit is bigger than all the British political parties put together so Britain has to do whatever it takes to get a proper Brexit (Hard Brexit).
anti	Brexit is boring. It and Donald Trump are horrible and pretending there is any nuance left more than that is a waste of time. If the audience can write the same political jokes as you, you don‚Äôt belong on stage.
anti	Brexit is breaking Britain. We must vote down May's deal.
anti	Brexit is built on lies and cheating. It‚Äôs time to #StopBrexit.
anti	Brexit is bullSH/T-sold to the general public by RICH liars,supported by the easily conned& promoted by the establishment loving media -name me one Tory policy that‚Äôs helped anyone in Austerity UK !?Homelessness/poverty/ austerity deaths on the rise while the Rich get tax breaks
anti	Brexit is causing me short term anxiety and long term depression. To the extent that I have lost sleep pondering political and economic scenarios. Scenarios which could lead to my government increasing or abusing powers, a decline in the standard of my food purchases, stagnant living standards, compromised employment protection and reduced residency rights in other EU countries.
anti	Brexit is developing into a project where there will be unpalatable comprises, painful trade-offs and potentially irresponsible political decisions with profound economic consequences.
pro	Brexit is done. Celebrate. The world has become a better place. What a great atmosphere in Parliament Square...brilliant.
anti	Brexit is driven by people with nothing to lose. Those who are cripplingly poor and want change and those who are rich seeking to get richer. You don't need Paddy Power to work out the odds of who will really benefit.
anti	Brexit is economic suicide for the UK.
anti	Brexit is evil putins project. Feminists and lgbtq must spearhead the fight against putin
anti	Brexit is fascism. Whenever people say such statements are exagerated, they're complicit. How bad is bad enough for the English to be able to face their own mess? Where do the English draw the line, gas chambers? Fascism does not require the existence of gas chambers, it's nevertheless still fascism. English nationalism is extremism. Brexit is embryonic fascism. It should've been recognized as such and aborted long ago. It has now metastasized and the English and their cowardnes are responsabile.
anti	Brexit is finished. We the people have spoken. We shall remain.
pro	Brexit is for the British , live with it.
pro	Brexit is for the best. Brits give more money to the EU than the EU gives back. Until Brits have left the EU they cannot have control over their borders. The trade will be fine as everyone else will leave the EU as well and trade will continue as normal.
anti	Brexit is for the richest in our country: they can afford recessions.
pro	Brexit is freedom. Brexit is getting out of an un-democratic container called the EU. The EU is a flawed, corrupt, undemocratic construct. Yanis Varoufakis (The Greek Finance minister, and intellectual, who resigned a few years ago) says so. He does say that it needs to be reformed from the inside out and does not advocate a Brexit. But from a practical standpoint, the EU is not reformable.
anti	Brexit is fueled mainly by ignorance, bigotry and xenophobia. I haven't heard one cogent economic argument for it. Just one would be enough to consider it. But nope, not even one.
pro	Brexit is giving the EU's remaining members a good reason to stick together
anti	Brexit is going to be a total disaster, why are we doing this?

anti	Brexit is idiotic.
anti	Brexit is impossible. Your only choice is either staying in the European Union as Citizens or as barbarian servants, rule makers or rule takers. Sorry if for a moment you thought otherwise
anti	Brexit is just a big pile of shit, can we just cancel this disastrous mess. 2 and a half years for this.
pro	Brexit is just a country governing itself, just like America Japan and New Zealand. There is nothing wrong with that. There is no hard or soft Brexit, just Brexit which will be a huge success long term.
anti	Brexit is just a sideshow for what is really going on here.
anti	Brexit is just idiotic. I can't believe the government allowed uneducated people to vote on such an important issue in the first place. Now they'll have to face the consequences and end up being an underdeveloped country in 50 years
pro	Brexit is just the first domino to fall in what will eventually be the collapse of the EU. It was doomed from the start: too many members had nothing in common culturally or historically.
pro	"Brexit is just the first domino to fall in what will eventually be the collapse of the EU. It was doomed from the start: too many members had nothing in common culturally or historically. For instance, most people in northern Europe see southern Europe as a place to go to play, not to do business and partner. Then there was Merkel's boneheaded decision to let immigrants in, no questions asked. Finally, there was the time-frame: people on both sides of the Pond believe that their governments have forgotten the citizens for whom they work. The cure for all three of those problems is to throw the b**tards out. Brexit is just the leading edge of what lies ahead. In the meantime, let us remember Maggie Thatcher's wise words from September 1986: ""We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels. Certainly we want to see Europe more united and with a greater sense of common purpose. But it must be in a way which preserves the different traditions, parliamentary powers and sense of national pride in one‚Äôs own country; for these have been the source of Europe‚Äôs vitality through the centuries."" I wish she were still with us. She and Reagan made a huge difference in the world. It is too-too bad--and sad--that there are no comparable leaders on the world scene today."
anti	Brexit is laborious, time consuming and (at times) all consuming.
anti	Brexit is like England going into a football tournament arrogantly thinking they are going to win it. The English get far too optimistic in the build up and then they get taken down with a bang and start girning.

anti	Brexit is making UK poorer. We should stay with the EU
pro	Brexit is not a mistake on our behalf. The EU didn't think we would go through with it, in fact even now Verhoff**** and Barnier are still in denial. The only economy that is likely to get hurt is the Euro
pro	Brexit is not a problem it‚Äôs an opportunity üëç
anti	Brexit is not changing EU at all, but will change UK economy in very painful way.
anti	Brexit is not going to happend :) :)
anti	Brexit is not gonna happen! This is a comedy show!
anti	Brexit is not good economic news for either party but I think that the EU will not fall so far as the U.K.
anti	Brexit is not ideal.
anti	Brexit is not quite as good as wartime Britain, in a war output has to increase. Our firms relocating abroad. and those that are staying here shutting down, or closing stores, in not the same thing.¬†The idea that brexit puts the G back in GB, is plainly, obviously, and completely wrong.

anti	Brexit is shaping up to be like a divorce in which one the parties is in a manic frenzy to leave and is not going to listen to any counsel about protecting his/her interests on the way out the relationship.
anti	Brexit is shit, more trouble than it's worth, was based on lies, and overall just creates an atmosphere of shitness across england
pro	Brexit is simple and harmless.
pro	Brexit is simple and harmless. It‚Äôs a straightforward question about whether we want to be in the EU or not and the answer‚Äôs no. It is true that some people catastrophize about it but why? Switzerland, USA, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand aren‚Äôt in the EU and they are all advanced, prosperous, democratic and civilised places.
pro	Brexit is simply a return to national self government as broadly understood to apply to the vast majority of countries which are not members of the European Union. ¬†It is astonishing that we ever abrogated this privilege and even more astonishing that so many of those who aspire to govern us have absolutely no faith in the country whatsoever.
pro	Brexit is so important, it gives us our freedom back.

anti	Brexit is the abyss..so stop believing that GB alone will bring Britons a better life..British colonial ego is the root of all this evil..it is showing that Britons are not capable to live with other Europeans when they cannot achieve or push through in the EU ..they are suddenly angry and behaved like a spoiled child.. Beware! Brexit will dissolve the union and the rest of it will regret this action for decades..

anti	Brexit is the biggest disaster the British people have faced since the second world war... If we leave the EU it will bring hardships on a scale that will make the 2007 recession look like a rainy Sunday afternoon. People voted for brexit based on feelings, not with their heads. And as a protest vote against the government. I can only hope that some common sense will prevail before we all pay the price for it at the end of March.
anti	Brexit is the biggest hit to Britain's status on the world stage since the Suez crisis. It's an act of cultural and economic suicide that is only going to make us poorer and nastier in the short and the long term.

anti	Brexit is the poisoned chalice given to the younger generations by the older. One can analyse the ins and outs of it and see how much the globalization the immigration hence the loss of national identity and the fears thereof contributed to it all.

pro	Brexit is the right thing for the UK
pro	Brexit is the right thing, finally people of the world are waking up to reality - the Euro king has no clothes!
anti	Brexit is the single biggest misstep in British history, brought about by self-seeing charlatans, and voted in by sheep.
pro	Brexit is the symptom - EU is the disease. EU will come to disintegrate anyway along with increased forced mass-immigration. To be or not to be - that's the question.
pro	Brexit is the will of the people
anti	Brexit is the worst political decision Britain will ever make, Britain just became worse off and the people who voted for Brexit will be the first to complain when they have less money and less standard of life. Lucky me I have 3 nationalities two being German and English.
anti	Brexit is the wrong move for our future, things will get needlessly complicated and it's time wasting. Most of the leave voters were old miserable smurfs in the 65+ age group, their future is as strong anyway. After the referendum, the most searched thing on Google was 'What is The EU?'. I think that just says it all. Not to mention our government is going in the direction of Somalia.
anti	Brexit is the ‚Äúsingle stupidest thing any country has ever done‚Äù .
anti	Brexit is threatening to destroy a century of development based on education, research and human capital
anti	Brexit is total shambles being railroaded through lies with no opposition challenging. Even if there was a GE there‚Äôs no large party against Brexit to vote for!
anti	Brexit is turning into a national disaster.
pro	Brexit is war. The EU is the enemy!
anti	Brexit is what Putin supported and trump for president is what Putin also supported. Both are a divisive shambles.

anti	Brexit is what happens when you make decisions sorely based on xenophobia, racism, bigotry and zero intelligence.
anti	Brexit is worse than Comic Sans.
anti	Brexit is, and always has been a complete waste of time and effort - unless you are either a right-wing, pro-American free market capitalist, or a dyed in the wool English nationalist, or you're just plain fed up with being taken for granted by politicians of whatever stripe and want to register a protest.
anti	Brexit isn't a solution EU reform is
anti	Brexit isn't going to happen. Those on here insisting it will, just make themselves look very silly.
anti	Brexit isn't just like shooting yourself in the foot, it is taking aim at it beforehand.
anti	Brexit it build on lies and cheating
anti	Brexit its like doing something stupid and then feeling too proud to admit they were wrong in the first place and sticking with it.
anti	Brexit itself is clearly a pig's ear driven in part by a rabid anti-EU faction in the Tory party
anti	Brexit itself is mad. A ‚Äúno-deal‚Äù Brexit is suicidal.
anti	Brexit itself is staggeringly likely to cripple the economy and has created a huge divide already in the country. Adding Scottish independence into the mix will almost certainly destabilise the economy even more and, if independence is sought after, politically split the country in two. In that sense, it would be incredibly destructive for the current government to risk that.
anti	Brexit itself was the con trick.

anti	Brexit makes me hate being british.
anti	Brexit makes me sad, anxious, regretful and angry. But it can‚Äôt stop me being European to my core. Like my fellow Scots, I refuse to succumb to isolationism. #LeaveALightOnForScotland
anti	Brexit makes me so sad
anti	Brexit makes me uncomfortable. It feels like we‚Äôre in no-man‚Äôs-land, and it doesn‚Äôt feel safe. People who voted to leave did so because of the scaremongering. It was all about immigration, but immigration is a great thing.
anti	Brexit makes me want to poke needles into my eyes
anti	Brexit makes no sense and Britain should vote again
anti	Brexit makes the UK a small, isolated, insular place with reduced influence. That must attract certain elements of the Republican Party.
pro	Brexit makes us a fully autonomous nation free of EU regulations and EU parliamentary decisions. Ensuring that when we vote for a law it can't be overturned by EU parliament. We're ensuring that we remain free of an EU super-state that aims to control everyone. We aim to keep free of a failing currency and economy and we are returning to our former glory of a nation that demands respect not laughed at and controlled by Brussels. We are ensuring that comrade Corbyn can't give our nation away.
pro	Brexit marks the beginning of the end of the EU. A great day!
anti	Brexit may have started as a dream, but it became more like Nightmare on Elm Street meets The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
anti	Brexit may well be the end of the Union and will have negative political ramification for years to come.

pro	Brexit means Brexit! Last chance for the rotten system to show, if there still a meagre rest of democracy is running through its veins.

pro	Brexit means OUT. The BRITISH majority have voted.

pro	Brexit means more jobs for the natives, less strain on hospitals, schools, doctor housing,all these built and payed for by the natives, and more money for britain, we will make our own laws and fish our waters we wont have to obey the unelected eurocrats, can the remainers give us a list of whats good about staying?
anti	Brexit means no trading deals, less profit to the uk
anti	Brexit means trade war!
pro	Brexit means we leave and should be no deals with these EU mongrel dogs.
pro	Brexit might put democratic reform back on the agenda. I am loving the right wing outrage at the House of Lords and although I doubt we will see PR anytime soon, disquiet with the Brexit dividend in Wales, Scotland, the North and NI might start people taking the idea of Federalism more seriously.
anti	Brexit must be halted in its entirety by all means necessary.
anti	Brexit must die
pro	Brexit must take the fight to the Remoaners with a vision of what it would be like if we stayed in the EU. Ugly and disasterous imho.
anti	Brexit needs to be reversed, this clearly shows the tories and May can't deal with this. We need to get Corbyn in to sort this mess out, brexit is no longer will of the people

pro	Brexit or a Betrayal of Democracy, the EU will not be getting any more of my money, neither will the government if we remain in the SM, CU, ECJ and continue with Free Movement of People from the EU.
anti	Brexit pays for the few while destroying the lives of the many.
anti	Brexit pretty much is the only international news we've been getting besides Ukrain/Russia and the Australian wildfires. From what I've heard it seems like it wasn't the best decision, and the process leading to the actual exit was a big clustefuck.
anti	Brexit propaganda is just that: propaganda. There is very little truth in any of it. It is not even particularly good propaganda. As to why anybody would believe anything that Boris the Liar says, that is completely beyond me. Ho-hum, some people are about to learn who is big and strong and tough, and who is little and weak and not so tough.
pro	Brexit red lines are constantly being broken. No compromise. We leave end of March with a deal or without a deal. They have had two years!
anti	Brexit removes our rights. Brings us new taxes. Tangles us in new bureaucracy. Brexit is a massive lie. There are precisely no benefits. Just drawbacks.
anti	Brexit requires zero effort to make it fail. It was a failure at its conception.
pro	Brexit saved Britain from hoard of East European paupers messing up British economy. There's no reason why Britain will not do better outside EU.
anti	Brexit seems to me an argument for a no deal.
pro	Brexit should be an easy process but parliament is full of weak and incompetent buffoons
anti	Brexit should be cancelled. There is no need for another referendum. Just don't do it, full stop. Simple.
anti	Brexit should be delayed forever!
pro	Brexit should happen for our betterment.
anti	Brexit should have never happened just like trump should have never become president
pro	Brexit should not be stopped.
anti	Brexit should not take place it is going to bad for everyone. we will have to pay extra money for goods and it is a way to avoid people of other countries to come and live here which is totally unfair.
anti	Brexit shows the power of propaganda (Leave.EU, tabloid newspapers, TV, social media) and how people could be manipulated into taking such a risky decision.
anti	Brexit something something hell on earth something shekels
anti	Brexit sucks
anti	Brexit sucks doesn‚Äôt it #Dyson... but he‚Äôll be ok, because just like so many other Brexit millionaires he‚Äôs moving offshore.

anti	Brexit to have greatest negative impact on regions outside London
pro	Brexit ultimately is for the best.
anti	Brexit voters continually misunderstand the complications of #Brexit. They just want less brown faces. Northern Irish boarder is more important to get right. What a mess.
anti	Brexit voters owe everyone in the UK and all citizens of the EU27 an apology for trying to destabilise the block.
pro	Brexit voters wanted freedom for 'all' British people from Brussels, remoaners wanted freedom for 'themselves' in Europe
pro	Brexit voters wanted freedom for 'all' British people from Brussels, remoaners wanted freedom for 'themselves' in Europe.
anti	Brexit was Putin's idea. Executed flawlessly.
anti	Brexit was a disaster from the beginning. It started with lies told about the EU, Farage even apologized for the lies.
anti	Brexit was a failure from day one. It was something Chump would do to my country. May is a female version of Chump and has proven it irrefutably.
anti	Brexit was a fantastic example of a nation shooting itself full in the face.
pro	Brexit was a good idea.
anti	Brexit was a hatred vote. Hatred of immigrants, foreigners, the EU and Muslims. No good can ever come of such negativity and Britain will sadly pay a terrible collective price unless it changes its mind.
anti	Brexit was a huge, huge mistake. A strong and stable Europe is now more important than ever.
anti	Brexit was a mistake
anti	Brexit was a mistake and I hope people my age will realise that and repeal it

anti	Brexit was a mistake. We demand a second referendum.
pro	Brexit was a must. ¬†Any other result means no democrazy for British citizens.
anti	Brexit was a reckless gamble and the Tories need to be held to account for this mess.
anti	Brexit was a terrible decision and I'm honestly ashamed that we, as a nation, voted leave
anti	Brexit was a total dumpster fire
pro	Brexit was a total success at 11pm on Friday, 31st January. We got our country back.
pro	Brexit was a war. We won
pro	Brexit was all about sovereignty and democratic accountability. Once we have regained them immigration and the economy can be sorted.
anti	Brexit was always a mistake from the first. Europe is stronger united.
anti	Brexit was always going to be death by a thousand cuts. Not just the deceitful ones that come naturally to Boris and his cabinet, but by businesses pulling away from the UK, by talent - especially in the NHS - removing itself from the country for good, but the EU will stand firm as a massive trading block on behalf of its member states.
pro	Brexit was an excercise in the wise (older voters) rescuing the young (brainwashed) voters from themselves.
anti	Brexit was and continues to be a disaster and funny enough, the main culprits (boris johnson and that snake farage) are oddly yet not surprisingly no where to be found.
anti	Brexit was and is on Putin's agenda. Stop it NOW.
anti	Brexit was and still is the stupidest thing that the UK has done. It is likely the Scottish will leave and that Ireland will re-Unify. That is the only reasons to MAYBE be ok with Brexit.
anti	Brexit was based on fear. Fear of the other. It was not a rational decision but a reactionary one. It was bad for Britain and it is bad for the residents of the Commonwealth. The only beneficiary of the Brexit was Russia.
anti	"Brexit was driven by British delusions of grandeur: ""re-assert the Comenwealth"" as if Canada & Australia wanted to be asserted against like its 1910...strike beneficial trade deals with the USA & China when the EU couldn't...""Global Britain"" at the heart of world trade...Yet the reason the UK needed to leave was that poor little Britain was getting bullied by the evil Germans & French...If the UK could not assert itself agains Paris & Berlin inside of the block, how will the UK assert itself against France & Germany backed by Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and the rest of the 27???"
pro	Brexit was heaven sent, a mirror revealing the hideous State of the Nation for all to see. The Establishment‚Äôs relationship with the people is an abusive one. With unsound money and measure every communication is dishonest; the public must be deceived for the confidence scheme of created debts to continue unabated. Some even consume bbc state propaganda and expect the truth. Parliament‚Äôs primary objective is to distract the unthinking and bury the real issues under a pile of deceit. You see, claiming the Crown operates a system of free market capitalism doesn‚Äôt survive close scrutiny. Capitalism only works in conjunction with sound money and measure. Capitalism with an unsound currency, like today‚Äôs pyramid scheme of banker‚Äôs debt, quickly descends into Kleptocracy, where markets get rigged and rapid debasement creates rampant structural inequalities, both within and across generations, without the chance of salvation. The ruling elite are unfit for purpose and the case for breaking up this cosy little club grows stronger every day. They cannot be trusted, they‚Äôre incapable of change, and they‚Äôre committed like a cult. Their source of power must be scattered to the four winds. England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, unite against the darkness of Westminster and like a light onto the world we shall restore sound money, for the benefit of all, not just the corrupt few.
pro	"Brexit was heaven sent,...."" Agreed. As while it shines a light on our Europhile establishment, it shines a much larger one on the EU, its aims and methods. Brexiteers couldn't have done a better job persuading many that voted Remain that they were wrong to do so, than the lesson learned by the Brussels strong arming of UK interests. Far many more want us 'to get on with it' than around the referendum time. No going back now, ever."
anti	Brexit was like the UK got drunk and accidentally unfriended Europe on Facebook
anti	Brexit was ruined from the start, they never intended on actually doing it.
anti	Brexit was sold as having all the benefits of EU Membership without any of the legal, regulatory, or financial responsibilities. People directly funded by Russian Intelligence, (who view the EU and NATO as a threat) lied to the British people promising Brexit meant a free ride.
anti	Brexit was stupid.
anti	Brexit was the biggest con in British history....
anti	Brexit was the biggest mistake of Uk.
anti	Brexit was the dream of a few tax-avoiding millionaires with powerful allies in the media. There has not been a single provable benefit except for those who can avoid the forthcoming EU tax-avoidance directive. Millions of our electorate have been whipped up into a populist frenzy believing that somehow the EU is the enemy when in reality they have been used as puppets of the elite. Sad.
pro	Brexit was the result of citizens getting tired of unchecked immigration.
pro	Brexit was the right thing period Merkel is assembling a 4th reich and purposely bankrupting countries to turn them into puppet governments.
anti	Brexit was the stupidest, most self-destructive act a country could undertake
anti	Brexit was the worst thing we have ever done voted for by uninformed people that got lied to by the leave campaign.
anti	Brexit was the worst thing we have ever done voted for by uninformed people that got lied to by the leave campaign. Same as the people that voted Trump because of all the BS he told them. Scare Tactics and populist nonsense. Brexit will not happen. If it does, its the end of the UK having any influence in the world.
anti	Brexit wasn't a good idea at any point. It was the rabid wet dream of a small bunch of millionaires who saw an opportunity for profit, which was enabled by a disenfranchised and misinformed public.
pro	Brexit wasn't about deals it was about leaving END OF
anti	Brexit wasn't properly discussed and the vote was done in impulse. The margin of 51.9 to 48.1 reflects the unsureness of some of the electorate. Lack of education, discussion, impulsiveness of the topic led to an ignorant vote.
anti	Brexit wasnt a rational argument for something, it was an emotional argument against something perceived as bad.
anti	Brexit will address nothing. Sort out immigration? Everyone I know on FB wasn't posting about anti EU immigration, they were posting about them Muslims or Asian refugees/ migrants coming into Europe. All Brexiters have is their old man xenophobia.. The whole project of Brexit is to make a small group of billionaires more wealthy with less accountability..
anti	Brexit will affect UK economy.
anti	Brexit will also bring another scottish referendum.
anti	Brexit will be a catastrophe?!
pro	Brexit will be a catharsis.
anti	Brexit will be a disaster.
anti	Brexit will be a disaster. Because we are creating barriers with our largest and nearest trading partners. Country is split 50/50. Expect politics to be polarised, as the video shows.
anti	Brexit will be a disaster. The idea of Brexit is as stupid as Trump's idea of a wall
anti	Brexit will be a disaster. The idea of Brexit is as stupid as Trump's idea of a wall ‚Äì ask any economist.
pro	Brexit will be a success, shame we have domestic traitors/terrorists destroying a democratic vote for freedom, maybe Miller, Dim Tim,Gleggy and the paedo Mandleson should bow out with British grace and stop displaying their treason for all the world to see!
pro	Brexit will be a success.
pro	Brexit will be good for Britain. Norway wisely refused European conglomeration. Norway is a very wealthy country.
pro	Brexit will be the best thing ever for the UK.
pro	Brexit will be the best thing that happened to the UK for decades
anti	Brexit will be the most negative affected.
pro	Brexit will be worth it, and could deliver better accountability and control to the people of the UK.
anti	Brexit will bring no opportunities and the UK has no potential as a result. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your Prime Minister aka Alice in Wonderland.

pro	Brexit will create many new opportunities.
pro	Brexit will destroy the EU. More will follow!
anti	Brexit will destroy the EU. More will follow! :D
anti	Brexit will do most harm to the regions especially the North and the poorer more remote regions of the UK. We don't need to leave the EU to decentralise Britain. Very much the opposite in fact. For the last few decades the EU has been the only government body attempting to improve the north of England, while Westminster did nothing. Brexit is in reality a suicide note from the poor.
anti	Brexit will end London's financial dominance.
pro	Brexit will happen, Brexit must happen. All the negative talk around Brexit is just fear monger appropriated by the EU. The EU NEEDS Brexit to fail in order to maintain civility amongst itself.
anti	Brexit will make every one poorer
anti	Brexit will make us a scratchy outsider with somewhat limited access to the single market, almost no influence and few friends
anti	Brexit will mark the end of Britain's role as a great power
anti	Brexit will not be better, but worse. I will gladly go into a discussion and provide proof on every point you made within the video to the opposit.
anti	Brexit will not happen. If it does, its the end of the UK having any influence in the world.
anti	Brexit will not help people in UK .
anti	Brexit will not quell the populist beast: it will feed it
anti	Brexit will not stop migration, it will simply cause problems for our economy. So I went for remain
anti	Brexit will only benefit the society in Britain to collapse earlier.
anti	Brexit will possibly even take the UK back to our standing before we were in the EU (which of course would be an absolute disaster - we joined because the country was quite literally failing)
anti	"Brexit will probably not ""End"" well for it came about based on LIES and ignorance much as the election of Trump in USA. Imagine that Brexit will increase the demands of Scotland, N. Ireland and maybe Wales for independence to varying degrees. Of course, there were complaints concerning the E.U. but think Winston Churchill said it was better to be in the tent than outside pixxing in, or something like that!"
anti	Brexit will probably ruin the economy
anti	Brexit will reduce the care and social backup that people need. Those with money will go to Poland for teeth, France for cancer, choose your Euro destination based on ailment, Switzerland for end of life services.
anti	"Brexit will reduce the care and social backup that people need. Those with money will go to Poland for teeth, France for cancer, choose your Euro destination based on ailment, Switzerland for end of life services. Look at the pro brexit politicians, from mad Jez Corbyn to the Rees Mog grouping, these are dyed in the wool ELITES. The complete con is the ""anything must be beter than this@ syndrome..."
pro	Brexit will regain control over fishing rights around our coast
anti	Brexit will ruin the UK
anti	Brexit will ruine the UK
anti	Brexit will sink the EU. It's like Titanic, holed below the waterline and sinking in slow motion.
pro	Brexit will spread economic growth across the nation
pro	Brexit will ultimately be a good decision for UK
pro	Brexit won because the ordinary people in the UK finally grew a pair and voted for common sense, apart from those idiots in Scotland.
pro	Brexit won people voted for it. That's democracy and rules and results have to be respected and assumed.
anti	Brexit won't bring back industry, it won't lead to high pay, it won't solve the housing issues, it won't lead to investment in infrastructure or the NHS.
anti	Brexit would be awful for the UK.
anti	Brexit would mean a huge loss of jobs. On the plus side, my train to work will be less busy in the mornings.
pro	Brexit yes! We are free!....
anti	Brexit! total nonsense!
anti	"Brexit"" is a mess !"
anti	Brexit' voters in Britain have done irreparable damage to the most enjoyable sport that nation has ever known: namely, treating Americans like idiots. But there is hope that, come November, Americans could become dumber than them once more.
anti	Brexit's a deeply shit idea
anti	Brexit's a terrible mistake and I'm proud that I voted Remain
anti	Brexit's the dumbest thing I have ever seen a serious, First World nation do in my lifetime. I can remember Vietnam and Watergate. What was the name of that movie a few years ago, the one set in the future where literal morons had bred out all the intelligent people and taken over the world? Idiocracy! Yeah, I used to think that was a joke. Then Brexit. Then Trump. Nope. It's not a joke anymore.
pro	Brexit, , while moderately painful to both member's and western economies, at least in the short run, will enable the world economy to better weather the eventual and inevitable collapse of the entire EU structure. Former Czech President Vaclav Klaus has been predicting this for many years, and every year his data grow more robust.

anti	Brexiteers are funny. The consequences of a no deal brexit aren't. Beware their deranged musings.
anti	Brexiteers are ideological fanatics. Brexit is like a socio-political suicide bombing. The U.K. was a VIP member of the E.U. with tonnes of perks and exceptions that no other E.U. member state was ever granted.
anti	Brexiteers are like Trump demanding his wall....and he got spanked too
anti	Brexiteers are like someone on a high diving board. They can't climb down because to do so would be to accept that they made a stupid decision, so they are trying to convince themselves to jump even though the pool is empty.
anti	Brexiteers are not the brightest.
anti	Brexiteers are solely responsible for the Irish border dilemma. They didn't think or care about the consequences of their actions.
anti	Brexiteers are the most ignorant, uneducated group of people I have ever seen. Even flat earthers have more about them. You are all humiliating yourselves and the UK.
anti	Brexiteers best start practicing puckering their lips in order to kiss goodbye their last colonies.
anti	Brexiteers deserve all the job losses and hardship heading their and their family‚Äôs way.
anti	Brexiteers don't understand that if we leave, we will campaign to rejoin! The time to start that campaign is now!
anti	Brexiteers form the fifth column in the West. They are Putin's soldiers who want to split the West and weaken and impoverish the UK.
anti	Brexiteers hate this as its a demonstration of parliamentary sovereignty, yet another thing they said they wanted and absolutely do not believe in.
anti	Brexiteers have such low IQ's they don't even know what they voted for......Second referendum coming right up.

anti	Brexiteers still thinking the world owes them something. It doesn't.
anti	Brexiteers voted the wrong way but the rest have to suffer.
anti	Brexiteers will destroy the UK. NI will join the Republic after the hard border is established and Scotland will leave and return to the EU and takes its North Sea oil with it. Wales will only stay in UK because of low rent English retirees who will swing the vote. The young will dance on their graves after they all pass over the next 7 to 10 years.
anti	Brexiteers. From today you no longer play the victim. Not anymore. You are now - all of you who voted for this - *accountable*. Lack of trade deals? It's on you. NHS sold to the wolves? It's on you. Endless layers of red tape that weren't there before? On you.
anti	Brexiteers: No downsides, only considerable upsides. LIARS.
anti	Brexiter MPs are not the problem ‚Äì it‚Äôs the other 600 of them

anti	Brexiters are so stupid. Waiting over 3 years for something that's not happening! Politicians laugh at you, europeans and the rest of the world laugh at you lol
anti	Brexiters believe that the last referendum settled out future with the EU for ever. It has not. The day after we leave I will be campaigning for Brejoin.
anti	Brexiters don't care how other people pay for their pensions.
anti	Brexiters have destroyed the country.
anti	Brexiters have farted in a room and then disappeared, leaving the rest of us arguing about it
anti	Brexiters have no idea what they actually do want, just lots and lots of (conflicting) what they don‚Äôt.
anti	Brexiters have offered no evidence that we will do great outside of the EU.
anti	Brexiters make me laugh...They want a good deal for them, ( UK deals) but no to respect the EU deals and ageements. Morons.
anti	Brexiters often try to oversimplify the economics of trade in order to maintain the fiction that buccaneering Britain can forge its own way in the world independent of the great trading blocks of China, the US and the EU. And of course they cite prosperous independent countries that are not in the thrall of any of them. Switzerland, Japan and South Korea are often mentioned. The devil is, as always, in the detail and one big detail is the fact that British industry has for over 40 years been busy integrating with Europe. Readjusting to life outside will be painful. Businesses will go bust and others will have to make painful changes. Of course knowing what changes are required would help but we are still in the dark on that one. When we look at how other smaller economies go it alone brexiters need to consider how they do it. Some in Asia have working practices and employment rights that no European would ever accept. There would be riots in the streets - even in supine Britain. We are not going to become South Korea or Malaysia. Other countries are small and specialise - we could do that but again the transition would be painful. In order to keep our mixed economy afloat and particularly the services sector Britain needs trade deals with many countries. Doing deals with countries smaller than we are should be relatively straightforward but we cannot survive without the big three. With them we are very weak. We no longer have the heft of the EU behind us and we will be bullied by all three of them.
anti	"Brexiters say "" Don't call us thick or stupid"". Cool , can you tell us any benefits of brexit , what problems in your life will be solved by leaving the EU ? fuck off remoaner , we won get over it , 17.4 million , you lost ,that's democracy etc Conclusion - Thick as pigshit"
anti	Brexiters seem to think that negotiations are like a pub brawl outside a Wetherspoon's.
anti	Brexiters spouting the usual fact-free nonsense. On the contrary, recent polls show greater support for EU membership than in decades (thanks to Brexit).
anti	Brexiters want their grandchildren to be poor just so they can feel good about themselves having ‚Äúachieved‚Äù something in life.
anti	Brexiters will go down in infamy old son. Their links to Putin and dark money will be exposed and history will judge them. May is just an idiot rabbit caught in the headlights of their corruption.
anti	Brexiters, not having fought in the war: ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt fight in the war to stay in the EU‚Äù People who actually fought in the war: ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt fight in the war for a terrible idea like Brexit‚Äù
anti	Brexiters, the truth hurts. You lot will cause an economic disaster if god forbid you win. John Deadwood and Jacob (Bertie Wooster) Rees-Mogg are despicable pathetic excuses of politicians who simply cannot accept the truth. Just like spoilt children. Vote In
anti	Brexitland must face the consequences of its idiocy, left and right. Politics will be revitalised once the two main and guilty parties split.
anti	Brexitors are going to find the devil‚Äôs in the details. But like Trump supporters in US, they will continue to blame EU, never taking responsibility for the results of what they‚Äôve done.
anti	Brexitshitshambles has demonstrated that the English are idiots. With backbone or not.

anti	Brexteers, you don't get to tell others how to feel; we don't want to get behind your actions; there is no healing and there will not be until we rejoin; so get over it and live with the consequences of YOUR ACTIONS
pro	Brilliant Boris, all this under funding etc has been while we have been in Europe, we have given them a fair chance to help us but we don't prosper under EU Influence, we are an island that is bigger than just its size ,leave now,make us GREAT Britain
pro	Brilliant article! I like in particular how you make reference to, and describe, those people and institutions that tried so hard to thwart Brexit and failed miserably. Why should we ever take these people or institutions seriously again. I really admire the grit, steel and determination of Boris Johnson, the influence and far reaching strategic vision of Dominic Cummings and the ERG for their constant pressure on people like May. Oh, and let‚Äôs not forget the crucial part that Nigel Farage has played in all of this, without his lifetime fight to exit the EU we would not be where we are today.
pro	Brilliant news, cant wait for Britain to be fully independent¬†üëç
pro	Brilliant speech, we need more like him on the side of Brexit and the majority who voted for it. Otherwise democracy will die and Corbyn will rule
anti	Brilliant! From being able to travel, study, work, live and eventually retire for the rest of your lives in a choice of 27 other countries to being able to go for 3 months without charge - what a deal!!!
pro	Brilliantly amazing PM Boris Johnson! Thank you that we leave EU and got our sovereignty and independence now as UK start a new beginning our lives with no Marxist to dictation in Jesus name I pray! Amen
pro	Bring On the best thing to happen to this country in years. BREXIT
anti	Bring in compulsory blue passports for all brexiteers. Remainers can hold onto their burgundy ones. Then when the food shortages start we know which cunts to send to the back of the line and when the redundancies happen the same fuckers can stand right at the front. /S
anti	Bring it on Stop BREXIT
pro	Bring on Brexit!
pro	Bring on a Hard Brexit we are the first of many to leave an already sinking ship...
anti	Brino Brexit is a smokescreen to appease baby boomers, many of whom won't be around in 5 years when we quietly undo May's deal and rejoin the EU without any of the hullabaloo of the past few days.
pro	Brit exit is for population control Like most eu countries should be looking for aswell
pro	Britain DOES NOT exist to give foreigners a better life.
anti	Britain always had an island mentality with one foot out of the door anyway. They went with the vote that promised them rainbows and unicorns. Good luck. You're gonna need it.
pro	Britain and America are God‚Äôs children. Britain is finally free.
pro	"Britain and Germany have been propping up the EU. The premise of the EU was to make it easy for a lot of countries to share money... loans and payback... to help with projects that would build up Europe as a whole and make it all come out ahead. The problem arose when money was lent to places like Greece and Italy, it was all spent or pocketed, then when the check arrives they look at it like ""wait... you expect me to pay you back? Are you nuts?"" Germany's trying to stick it out by providing bail-outs... but you're bailing out countries that have corrupt governments pocketing the cash and have no intention of paying anything back. You might as well toss all the cash on a bonfire. I think Britain finally got tired of this. Good for them."
anti	Britain be ashamed!
pro	Britain belongs to a continent called Europa. This does not mean she must bow to an unelected bureaucracy in Brussels
anti	Britain can't regain what it wants, the kind of power and autonomy the nation had before WWII. No nation can have that anymore.
pro	Britain cannot be an economic toilet for the world
pro	Britain chooses self-determination. Good on them.
anti	Britain commits suicide
anti	Britain commits su√Øcide
pro	Britain could tailor its post-Brexit immigration policy to the needs of the economy.
pro	Britain desperately needs to go away EU and sort itself out.
pro	Britain did the RIGHT thing to leave the eu - nothing good was going to happen by staying
pro	Britain did the RIGHT thing to leave the eu - nothing good was going to happen by staying!
pro	Britain did the right thing getting out of the EU. It's all about taxation without representation. The UK is now free to govern themselves again. Being a member of the dumb EU makes your country's taxes go way up.
pro	Britain didn't leave the EU, the EU left Britain.
pro	Britain doesn't need the EU. it's a burden.
anti	Britain dropping out of the EU means that Britain itself is putting up trade barriers to the EU and that all treaties that currently apply to Britain today (via the EU) will cease to exist. The UK has to take the necessary steps to be able to live on its own. brexit is not a good time.
anti	Britain economy will end up like Britain car industry
anti	Britain economy will end up like Britain car industry :/

anti	Britain goes into the Middle Ages. Scotland into the future of Europe. Scots, you are a free nation, remember about the struggle of ancestors for independence
anti	Britain got conned just like Trump voters. They believed all the lies and now the lies have been proven false. I hope they stay in the EU, although I know that is a long shot.
anti	Britain has a great many talented people. However, it no longer has superiority in any particular technological field. Financial services and legal services are the exception. If we crash out without a deal, therefore, we will see a decline in our manufacturing output and it is difficult to see where the growth areas of new trade can come from aside from financial services. All this will further entrench the divide between London and the South East and the rest of Britain. The Government can try to offset this with public spending, but the Conservatives have never really been committed to this at the level it would be needed. Altogether rather a depressing picture.
anti	Britain has already started to sink below the horizon
anti	Britain has been wanting to cheat and go off on our mid-life crisis whilst the EU has kept the kids & house in order.
anti	Britain has betrayed Europe.....never should have trusted them in the first place. Wish them all the luck on their island while it's floating far unto the ocean.
anti	Britain has left a free market agreement on Friday night and now wants a free trade agreement on Monday morning?
pro	Britain has no reason to abandon its standards. But it should not be dictated to by micromanagers from Brussels who don‚Äôt have a clue about industry (financial or otherwise). London is a financial services hub. If the EU want to cut their own nose to spite their face it‚Äôs up to them.
anti	Britain has the finest cabbages in the EU. Unfortunately they are all in Parliament.
anti	Britain has the independence to do their own trade deals again. Never heard anyone so excited looking for scraps
anti	Britain is Confused! Britain hurt itself in its own confusion!
anti	Britain is a failed nation
anti	Britain is a shitshow and Bozo is the star.
anti	Britain is a sinking ship that wants to drag as many down with them as possible.
pro	Britain is a strong independent woman that don't need no man
anti	Britain is a tiny island, a pitty island. Brexiters are very naive, they will regret.
anti	Britain is basically Pompeii if Pompeii had voted for the volcano.
pro	Britain is better off without the eu
anti	Britain is destroying itsself. First they lost their empire and soon they have lost their country
pro	Britain is going to be fine.
pro	Britain is going to be just fine. As a matter of fact, Britain is going to be even better than it was. Just you wait and see.
anti	Britain is hacking off one leg for the freedom to hop on the other.
pro	Britain is leaving the eu..eu is dead anyway only a matter of time
anti	Britain is like the wife/husband who always says ‚ÄòI‚Äôm leaving,‚Äô and talks about it constantly, and drags their feet. Now they arguing over who will get the house/kids/money/cars and dogs. And the kids are saying, ‚Äòman who cares just stop fighting.‚Äô
anti	Britain is one of the most important countries in EU . Britain is very important for EU development and for the most for our democracy .
pro	"Britain is only the first in a row, more countries will follow soon. eussr is crumbling, the ""superstate"" was just a ""historical"" accident ..."
pro	Britain is our country! And we took it back today. A democratic country. And we are just trying to protect that and stop us letting so much influence on the decisions we make come from other countries. Countries that don't know anything about England, it's people, it's culture, it's problems and what the people of England want. Anyone who thinks Europe will ever be fully united and as one with no tension is living in gaga land. Aka Angela Merkel. Europe were talking about here. A bunch of countries in the same continent yes but each country so extremly different from the other in so many ways. And we somehow believe we can all get along, all want the same thing so should be governed by a central government that treats us like we have no sovereignty... HELL NO.
pro	Britain is reclaiming its agency as a self-governing nation.
anti	Britain is screwed and on a fast track to dictatorship ... But keeping their sovereignty is still preferable.
pro	Britain is smarter than another european countries
anti	Britain is splitting from the EU because people in some parts of the UK don‚Äôt want to answer to Europe and are ill-informed about the actual impact immigrants make on social services (little...it‚Äôs Tory cuts to just about any social service the government used to provide that is causing pressure). This withdrawal would also mean losing the worker‚Äôs rights they have enjoyed as a result of membership. The UK has a limited manufacturing base to support itself, and what it possesses in terms of large scale manufacturing has, with a few exceptions, begun making plans for pulling out of the country because of the implications of Brexit. There is some agricultural development but the UK is generally shifting to a largely service-based economy, services people won‚Äôt be able to pay for when their wages drop with the loss of rights, nor have time for when their working hours per week are extended. Food quality will drop as the UK imports from the US, where they have had FOUR major recalls of basic fresh food in the last three weeks, alone. But hey, blue passports! I think I understand it pretty well, no?
anti	Britain is the master of bureaucracy and financial control. But now it's cherry picking in an apple orchard. How'd you like them apples Bojo?
anti	Britain is the worlds 5th economy now, it wasn't before it joined the EU.
pro	Britain leaves, they get their industry back. It's that simple. We have to stop this monstrosity that is Globalism
anti	Britain looks just like my cats - standing in the doorway, not knowing whether they should come in or go out
pro	Britain lost Europe? I saw it more like, Britain pulling off a daring, yet cheeky escape from 'Colditz' 'right under the krauts noses, escaping in a makeshift glider fashioned from a number of red cross parcels, a childs tricycle, pressed carbolic soap remnants, a christmas tree bauble and a chaiz longue acquired from Shultz' (one of the guards, long story), in exchange for a number of fork handles, our championship racing beetle 'Billy' and a tin of peas! British inginuity and down right bloody mindedness at it'sfinest in the face of insurmountable odds (' ' .)
pro	Britain made the right choice. Down with the EU, long live the Queen!
pro	Britain must exit. The EU is a failed ideal
pro	Britain must not only reject Muslim immigration but also EXPEL the Muslims they foolishly already let in. You are correct that there are already enough breeding Muslims to turn Britain into a third world country by 2050. BREXIT!
anti	Britain needs to learn to embrace the world and not to fear it. Today you need Brexit tomorrow you will need Wrexit (World Exit). Britain is not happy with Europe. Are they ever satisfied with anything? The world needs to remove borders not build huge and beautiful walls.
pro	Britain never really believed in the EU dream. Let them leave I say! Let them be the nation that isnt part of the United States of Europe, the sick man of Europe. I care not.
pro	Britain never voted to join the EU, it voted to join the EEC back in the 1970's which was nothing more than an innocent trading organisation, not a bad thing exactly. Sadly over the years the truth about the sinister project has come to light and through various ratification & treaties, none of which the people of the UK had a say on, the trading bloc has become an authoritarian political entity that aggressively controls the economies of its members and seeks to promote a pan-European identity. Go back in history and there's a certain German political movement that behaved the same way in the 1930/40's and we all know where that went! In fact the whole European integration idea was conceived by Nazis who escaped the noose at the Nuremberg Trials. There's nothing wrong with nations being free & independent where they can trade exactly on their terms and not receive interference from a bunch of unelected bankers & investors. With the Referendum the people took on the arrogant establishment (that still influences media & entertainment in the UK) and against their smug predictions actually won.
pro	Britain not for sale Mr Soros. Just because we love our Country doesn't make us racist
pro	Britain owes the EU absolutely nothing......No deal .
pro	Britain resisted a trend for a socialist one world government.....GOOD FOR THEM!
pro	Britain should also change it's laws and implement harsher punishments for criminals, something the liberal controlled EU forbade.
anti	Britain should ditch the monarchy before EU.
pro	Britain should just leave without a deal......then, figure it out !!!
pro	Britain should leave the EU
pro	Britain should leave the European Union alone
pro	Britain should never have joined the EU
pro	Britain should regain control of our borders
anti	Britain should remain, the EU needs reform not destruction. You can't have your pie and eat it too.
pro	Britain should wait for the EU to come begging to trade as they will on the 11th hr, we need to stand firm we can not give in or be dictated to by the EU, thats why we left so we dont have to follow their rules anymore
pro	Britain should ‚Äúregain control‚Äù of its borders.
anti	Britain shouldn't leave the EU and shut the borders because of fears of immigration.
pro	Britain shouldnt burn like France. BREXIT!
anti	Britain shrinks to a sort of economic 'Middling Britain', useful for some great shopping and often great theatre, but not to be seen as a serious global player anymore
pro	Britain standing up for it's sovernity ... God bless
pro	Britain survived without the EU for hundred of years and will continue after they leave!
anti	Britain talking brexit while EU does more free trade with Japan Corea and many other queuing to trade with EU :))
anti	Britain taught the world really a lesson! Use your brain before you act blond! Prolong the withdrawal period and drag the rest of Europe in your homemade problems???? No thank you Britain! For One time solve your own problems without the EU blaming for your failures and failings!
anti	Britain tbh is committing suicide. It's economy will never be good.
pro	Britain wants freedom. People voted. Eu is destroying peoples identity this way it‚Äôs easier to control and manipulate people. I don‚Äôt understand why no one sees this. Britain. Was a strong and vibrant country well before EU. With strong identity and culture. Same like a lot of other European countries that had been affected by this fake ideas of eu
anti	Britain wants the benefits of the EU without being in the EU. Thats never going to work. Thats why they cant come up with a deal.
pro	Britain wants to keep its national sovereignty and make its decisions effecting their people all on its own without some massive bureaucratic body based in Belgium interfering or other countries interfering that may not share British values.
pro	Britain was Master of the World just over a hundred years ago -- and they did it all by themselves while FIGHTING Europe every step of the way. If they could do that then, they can do it all over again now. You have voted to leave, then leave with pride and dignity. No need to grovel for a few table scraps. Where is that famous stiff upper lip? The hell with EU. Make Britain Great again!
pro	Britain was hesitant to enter into the EU and ever since it has been a bit resentful it even kept using the British Pound over the Euro. Britain being part of the EU has benefited the EU rather than the country its self. Britain prior to joining the EU had been Self Sufficient in its oil and food subsidies. Both had reached an unsustainable level because of the migrant population in the country. All of the people from other countries living there will not have to get a Visa or leave. Again that Benefits the country. They have seen the decline of other countries in the EU like Greece and said, this is not going to happen to us. Britain will not be the last country to leave either. Many People say Germany and Poland are next.
anti	Britain went down the drain not because of the EU but you did it yourselves. Starting from the government going all the way down to the man on the street. Typical E.G. the car industry. Shoddy workmanship. The british worker no pride in doing his Job. So dont blame the EU for the position that your in.
anti	Britain wil fall apart. Thanks to brexit. Scotland will be an independent European country.
anti	Britain will be a nation with no future if we leave without a trading agreement with the EU. The negatives are that we will have to pay tariffs on any goods we export to Europe, making our goods more expensive in Europe
pro	Britain will be an example of how everything massively improves once one gets rid of excessive meddling bureaucracy.
pro	Britain will be independent again we will rebuild from this occupation of libtards and we will take back what is rightfully ours
pro	Britain will be just fine
anti	Britain will be worse than n korea
anti	Britain will go into depression and the E.U will bloom...there is always another side to a coin.
anti	Britain will just keep brexiting infinitum, until its just farage and the Queen throwing shit at each other with everyone else having been kicked into the sea for not being British enough.
pro	Britain will make BREXIT a success !!
pro	Britain will make BREXIT a success !! we will create a new Business britain! lets make a free tax for business for a limited time, keep them here . use the WTo system rules with china , US mexico and brazil etc etc
pro	Britain will never fall! Britain has allways been some of the strongest country in the world.
pro	Britain will never fall! Britain has allways been some of the strongest country in the world. And why Brexit? It is all about uncontrolled Migrant crises dictated by Germany and France.
anti	Britain will regret for leaving the European Union. After 2 years there will be lots of crisis in Britain. Congratulations Britain.
anti	Britain will return to the EU in 2-3 years. What Brexit supporters know, but fail to admit, is that Britain simply cannot survive outside the EU. Of course, by that time, there won't be a 'Britain', as we know it. An independent Scotland and a united Ireland spell the death knell for the UK, but Johnson and his ilk are willing for those things to happen. England and Wales will return to the EU in 2-3 years.
anti	Britain will suffer huge economic loss after Brexit.
anti	Britain will think back to join the EU ,but now we consider him as a lost animal
anti	Britain won't recover from Brexit for at least half a century, and that's assuming that the world's geopolitics remains the same ‚Äì which it patently will not.
anti	Britain won‚Äôt recover from Brexit for at least half a century, and that‚Äôs assuming that the world‚Äôs geopolitics remains the same ‚Äì which it patently will not.
pro	Britain would so much better if we left the eu
anti	Britain's GDP will fall like a rock as they rid themselves of the brightest 10% of their population in slamming the door on immigrants. The USA will be joining them in the has-been category quite soon. One sure result: a free and independent Scotland.
pro	Britain's exit is a huge blow to the dream of a united europe? I'am sorry but britain was the one disrupting the dream of a united europe. For example: they didn't take in the euro and they didn't accept the schengen agreement(territory where the free movement of persons is guaranteed). Two things leading to a better united europe. We always knew britain was only after the trading side of joining the eu. Thats why they got rejected twice when wanting to join the eu in the first place. The way i see it: We're better off without them.
pro	"Britain's exit is not a blow to ""the dream of a united Europe"" at all - it is a blow to the corporate elite's dream of undemocratic inverted totalitarianism. The EU must change, an Britain is leading the way to that change."
pro	Britain's new independence day! Congratulations. Death to the EU and globalist politicians everywhere
pro	Britain's performance has more in common with the economic recovery in the US than the Eurozone. It doesn't really look like we need the EU.
anti	Britain's role in Europe is to show leadership. Germany and France dominate because we let them. Britain, instead of winging and asking for special conditions for ourselves like a spoilt child, should be obstinately fighting to reform the entire EU - from within!
pro	Britain's version of Declaration of Independence. Now they know how we in USA felt way way back when. Now we have even more in common. Congratulations to Great Britain! WOW!
anti	Britain, is now completly isolated, bad decision.
pro	Britain, leave the EU!
anti	Britain, you have been naughty. You are not going to get a third chance.
anti	"Britain: ""we don't want to be in the EU anymore"" EU: ""ok... well I guess you don't get all these benefits"" Britain: "" but we want those benefits "" EU: "" then stay in the EU? "" Britain: "" ... ... ... no"""
pro	Britan is a great country it will be better off without EU corrupting everything.
anti	Britian in 5 years Scotland decleares independenc Norhten Ireland unites with Ireland Wales declares independenc bye bye The British Empire xd
pro	Britian is opening itself up to the rest of the world but at the same time making its own rules. Eu is closing itself of by dictating trading with only eu countries. Thats my 2 cents.
pro	Britian made a good choice hopefully France or Germany will leave next
pro	Britian only wanted the Trade part of the EU not the whole one united country thing.
anti	Britian will become an irrelevant island in the future
pro	British and American troops liberated Belgium from the Nazis 75 years ago, and now some globalist in Brussels with assistance from Merkel think they control the destiny of Britain? WTF is wrong with people? Why would any British citizen bow to their lessers?
anti	British are delusional What makes them think They'll be better than 27 countries 300 million plus?
anti	British are upset that Germany is the superpowers of Europe. you thou ww2 would have destroyed Germany. you thought wrong and their ruling and making more money. the British are just very hateful people.
pro	British culture? The drunk soccer hooligans who go trash Amsterdam and Paris on weekends? Europe will be fine without them.
anti	British do not come to Spain for vacations please, bye bye!
anti	British families enjoy lower mobile phone roaming charges, lower credit card fees, cheaper flights and proper compensation when flights are delayed or cancelled. These sorts of benefits could not be achieved by Britain alone.
pro	British farms will be back in business and thriving again
anti	British have lost their mind that's for sure.
pro	British industry will continue to be shipped abroad (mainly EU countries) thus fulfilling Germany's dream of `putting us in our place
pro	British people are fed up with legal immigration. The current illegal migration is unstoppable
anti	British people are starting to say #Regrexit lol
pro	British people believe in this country, vote leave!
pro	British people don't want immigrants to come into the country not because they are racists but because they take jobs and put a strain on stuff used by the population like schools and hospitals.
pro	British people have already spoken Britain first now leave means leave, Britains coming home yippee yippee yippee
anti	British people will be sorry the left it will be difficult for traveling
pro	British problems can b addressed by the British people via their elected British government. No the filthy EU.
anti	British racists are crying because they have lost it! Germany is smart and successful because it is Germany!
pro	"British sovereignty is a rock in an otherwise very shaky European continent which has undergone tremendous problems due to unstable continental European governments throughout history. Great Britain is very much the ""watcher"", overseeing Europe and always taking the high road when trouble arises. Communists, fascists, socialists, both world wars, expansionist Russia (Crimean War), Napoleon, the Sun King - we have stood up to all of them and won. It's important for Britain - more than any other country in Europe - to remain an independent guardian of freedom and democracy."
pro	British waters for British fishing communities ..simples..
anti	British will pay a heavy price coming soon
pro	British yeah go. You are doing good job i hope you will leave eroupe soon
anti	Britons left the EU and we Bosnians are still trying hard to join. Damn we're down
pro	Britons might even be able to afford to have 3 or 4 kids again.
pro	Britons! Vote for sovereignty and self determination! Not plutocratic bureaucrats in Brussels!
pro	Brits are an example of courage to the rest of the world.
pro	Brits are happier outside and EU is much better without UK. Leave is real win-win solution !
anti	Brits have any money for holidays after Brexit and the inevitable economic collapse.
anti	Brits that still think a no deal brexit is a good idea are so ignorant. I was just watching the results on tv and there were people being interviewed outside, just ordinary citizens, no politicians. A guy said to just have faith in their country, that they'd make it with or without a deal. The ignorance that comes with this nationalism is exhausting.
anti	Brits the most stupid people on Earth :D
pro	Brits voted Leave for all the right reasons - its a gesture/indication of Self-confidence and Strength. Don't forget these are the same people that ensured they kept their own Currency when they first ventured into the EU experiment (when they ventured on board the Titanic).
anti	Brits voted for Brexit for the same reasons Americans voted for trump ... discontent mixed with ignorance.
anti	Brits will know this time next year how Brexit looks. There will certainly be victims and it is questionable who the winners will be if any. Have faith, we Americans have had to live with trump for three years, we are still here, damaged and disillusioned but still here and fighting back.
anti	Brits with less than 15 months left on their passports may not be allowed to travel to Europe under a Brexit, it is very inconvenient.
pro	Brits, please vote to leave - the States don't need our greatest ally subsumed by an undemocratic, bureaucratic Leviathan - run like the wind
anti	Brits, what the hell are you doing?
anti	Brittisch people live with the idea of 100 years ago that they are still a super power. They will become a poor country with no power. With still the same unhappiness about their politicians.
pro	Brtian used to rule the waves, now they are nothing but slaves
pro	Brussel bullies......we are a strong people and we don't put up with bullies
pro	Brussels Set For Meltdown As EU Scrambles To Replace UK‚Äôs ¬£8.4Billion Enjoy scraping it together guys we will enjoy

anti	Bulgaria forgives you. Please stay in the EU! We can work on being more romantic!
anti	Bumped into acquaintance at shop this morning. Asked how she was. Said fine looking forward to Friday. I looked totally blank. She then said ‚ÄúComing out on Friday. Are you going to the party at the pub?‚Äù The lunatics are now totally in charge of the asylum.

anti	Bunch of old people celebrating for something that will affect the new generation and not them‚Ä¶
anti	Bunch of racist who have little regard or knowledge of what a hard Brexit will do to our economy .
pro	Burn Lisbon, No Deal and remove us from this corpse. It has taken it's last breath and is starting to smell. Move us out of the mire for good.
anti	Burn your country to the ground because you don't like immigration....brilliant!
pro	"Burned an EU flag this morning in my back garden and asked Alexa to play ""Ode to Joy"" as my wee contribution to the celebrations today. Can't tell you how happy I am!!"
anti	Bury Brexshit
anti	Business owner who claimed Brexit would make Britain thrive loses his business
pro	Business? Brexit is more important even if the British people have to pay the price and are poor - Brexit first
pro	Businesses have shafted the people for decades, and the EU is the vehicle for shafting us even more.
pro	But EU is anti-democratic organization, so it makes sense to reject the pessent who think their vote matters
anti	But I actually agree with what Theresa May said last April; Brexit would be a disaster for the UK economy and trade.
pro	But I don't want the UK to have anything to do with the EU's political structure.
anti	But a System it not helped by leaving it, but by putting effort into changing it. The EU is a product of a political process and not an already finished end-product. I don't understand your argumentation
pro	But do you trust the European government more than the government of your own country? I would think you have more control/influence over your national government than over that monster in Brussels
anti	But farmers are to get protection from Brexit to the tune of ¬£3bn why cant small businesses claim that same level of protection from Brexit... why and how is Brexit so good when we need Protection from it? - Where is ours?
anti	But for the majority, it's a moment of despair. But we will rejoin - probably sooner than you think.
anti	But in fact only 37% of the voting population voted to leave.. no way a majority.
pro	But it's not about money it's about sovereignty and if the cost is measured in ¬£ or $ it'll be way cheaper than last time we decided we didn't want to be part of a European (German) state. A price many Americans paid for us at that time too. Money isn't everything !
pro	But its not just the backstop is it its the 39b the 21 month extension fishing gibraltar the falklands and so much more we dont even hear about now all swept under the carpet all extra money for the eu mafia
pro	But outside the echo-chamber that is the metropolitan liberal class, the real people of Britain saw things differently
anti	But the EU is going to ban cups of tea, front doors, water, and air. So I heard.
pro	But the EU remains a conglomeration of vastly differing countries in size, language, culture, economy and a hundred other things. It can never be moulded into a single state.
pro	But what about democracy. There has already been a vote. But if the people who voted no get in power they just tell the people who won to piss off? That‚Äôs how you get civil unrest.
anti	But you are free to dream further of your Lala land where the whole world is on its knees to get granted some breadcrumbs by the British empire. I am sure that times are long gone by now.
pro	Buy British : beef, pork, milk, butter, apples, lamb, fish, cheese, new world wines, British clothing, British US and Japanese cars, holiday in UK or Commonwealth, UK beers, household items, fly BA if at all.
anti	Buy British would result in starvation of half of the Brits.
anti	By Brexit the UK shot itself in the belly when fishing.
anti	By all accounts we (as a whole) think brexit is a mistake and would vote to remain in the EU.
pro	By demographics we are still part of Europe. But we simply don‚Äôt wish to be ruled by the EU. It‚Äôs so simple!
anti	By disrupting 45 years of agreements and treaties the UK are causing unnecessary chaos.
anti	By leaving UK will lose Scotland and NI, and many jobs. They think they are a colonial power, but they are not. We are in 2019, not in 1800..
anti	"By leaving the EU your damaging the economy, so many businesses have chosen to leave the UK due to the possible ramifications of this decision. A start up company that I worked for had to fire hundreds of employees due to them having to relocate as a direct result of leaving the EU, as most of their products were sourced from Europe. I swear there needs to be an IQ test before they allow people to vote. Bunch of thick scrounging scum bags get an education and maybe people from other countries wouldn't have to do ""your"" jobs for you !"
pro	By leaving, we will again be able to determine who does and does not enter the UK
pro	By staying in the imperial dictatorship of the EU. That is medieval!
anti	By stopping Brexit, investing in skills and providing tailored support to key industries, we can get the UK economy back on track and help the communities that have been hit hardest by the threat of Brexit.
anti	By voting for Brexit, I think we are on course to make Britain inhospitable to many foreign workers who help our country function.
pro	By withdrawing from the EU, we can organise economic and social affairs in this country not by deliberate design from the top down
pro	Bye Brits ,just go with your arrogance and racism. EU owns majority of your companies ,so guess where they will go after Brexit.
pro	Bye Bye EU BYE BYE. The FT don't like the little people winning! Ha ha ha.
pro	Bye Bye EU Socialist!
pro	Bye Bye to a corrupt European Union
pro	Bye EUSSR
anti	Bye bye Brits, may the arrogance be with you!
pro	Bye bye EU your worthless
pro	Bye bye EU!!!!!!
pro	Bye bye EU, hello freedom!
anti	Bye bye EU. Bye bye Scotland. Bye bye Great Britain. Hello Little England.
anti	Bye bye London finance industry!
anti	Bye bye tv licence fee.....
anti	Bye bye, don‚Äôt let the door hit you
pro	Bye bye, no deal no money. Times will be hard for a bit but we‚Äôll come through. Have a good life EU
pro	Bye merkel, tusk, macron, bye bye üòÉ
pro	C'mon Britain let's tell every one you know that leaving is the only way of saving this country's proud proud history and giving our children and grandchildren the chance of a free future
pro	CELEBRATE!
pro	CK1I knew someone would pop out on this one , just shows. Vote out
pro	CONGRATS TO OUR MATES ACROSS THE POND!!GOD BLESS!!!! THIS IS WHAT THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE LOOKS LIKE!! FREEDOM, LIBERTY, INDEPENDENCE & SOVEREIGNTY BE YOURS....FOREVER!!
pro	"CONGRATS UK on Exiting the SOCIALIST BREXIT!! ""They may take away our lives, but they'll never take our FREEDOM!!!"""
pro	CONGRATULATION UK. CONGRATULATIONS NIGEL.......I confess, I didn't think you had it in you.
pro	CONGRATULATIONS BRITS! Great to hear you're getting your country back and no longer subjected to the silly laws and restrictions from the out of touch EU leaders.
anti	CONGRATULATIONS TEAM! WE WILL BE REMAINING IN THE EU! YES!!!!!
pro	CONGRATULATIONS To the British for regaining their FREEDOM !! No matter what the cost, a little or a lot, you will never regret this day. AMERICA IS WITH YOU !!!
pro	CONGRATULATIONS, BRITAIN!! MUCH LOVE AND ENVY FROM CANADA!!
pro	Call there bluff, watch the EU come running.
pro	Calling a second EU referendum will further damage the government proving does not listen to the will of this country. The people of the country have voted out and this needs to be respected and honoured The public has cast their votes and voted for a Brexit. This should be respected. If the EU referendum had resulted in a remain vote coming out as the majority then the leave campaign would not get a 2nd referendum. Whatever the result for the referendum, the goalposts should not be moved because one side has lost.
pro	Cameron and Osborne lied. The ivory tower bureacracy of the EU is opposed to democracy. The road to hell is paved with unaccountable bureaucrats.
anti	Can Boris Johnson refund me and thousands of expats the money lost from my pension (converted to euros) due to the pound devaluing after the #Brexit vote, of which he was an instigator? Only then he can carry on bullshitting.
anti	Can Farage or the brits understand how much Ireland wants the brits OUT of Ireland? Irony? Scotland wants you out too
anti	Can Farage or the brits understand how much Ireland wants the brits OUT of Ireland? Irony? Scotland wants you out too!
pro	Can I ask you a question that no politician, past and present remainer has answered, and that is what are the benefits of the EU for the working class. There are none, the aim is to make us poorer,and the rich , richer, it is happening.
pro	Can Remainers continue complaining after we have left? Maybe they should rename them selves the Returners and start campaigning to return.
pro	Can anyone suggest even ONE sensibly honest and practical reason for Britain remaining under EU commission rule?
anti	Can anyone who voted to leave please explain to me how we are going to get better trade deals with the EU than we have/had.
anti	Can some politician have an ‚ÄôEmperors new clothes‚Äô moment please and ask the government to justify this fiasco without reverting to ‚Äôwill of the people‚Äô. We have no withdrawal deal, no trade deal in sight, no arrangement on services, Scotland wants to leave the UK, there is no solution is sight for NI, Gibraltar will be open to Spanish claims. The government is making plans for food and medicine shortages, gridlock and riots. Teresa May, I challenge you to justify this mess.
anti	"Can stop blaming the evil EU and start blaming ""Londoners""? Always great to find a new scapegoat."
pro	Can these globalists shut up already? The people voted, at least pretend we still have democracy.
anti	Can they change their minds and rejoin later, once they sober up?
pro	Can we get a 'Go Fund Me' page to help unleash the UK's potential?
anti	Can we just forget about BREXIT and act as if it never ever happened at all?
anti	Can we just stop Brexit now? It was fun for a bit but now its just tedious..
pro	Can we nuke Brussels yet?
pro	Can we please just leave
anti	Can we sue TM for taking us hostage on this undeliverable brexshit rollercoaster.
anti	Can you imagine ANY other circumstances when a THIRD of UK businesses would be planning to move out of the country? This is on your head @theresa_may @Conservatives & unless you stop enabling Brexit, you too @jeremycorbyn
pro	Can't believe Remainers think the EU is a good thing!? It beggars belief. It threats the peoples & Nations of Europe with contempt
pro	Can't believe how brainwashed the Remainers and uninformed those young adults are. Stop the bickering, grow a pair and get patriotic. Britain will be far better off outside than in (b.t.w. I'm an educated white collar worker). I'm fully prepared to trade one or two years of uncertainty for a lifetime of self rule and all the prosperity it'll give to Britain from innovation, entrepreneurship and true free trade. Rule Britannia!
anti	Can't believe people were that deluded to vote leave... The poor sods! Glad we are staying
pro	"Can't believe some people still trying to ""get around"" the #Brexit."
pro	Can't come soon enough. Make Britain Great again.
pro	Can't help thinking, if the EU is such a utopia, why do so many people risk their lives crossing the Channel to get out of it? These people come from complete shit holes, but after a few days in France they'd rather die than stay there. ROFLMFAO
pro	Can't wait for EU away #Brexit
anti	Can't wait for Scotland and Northern Ireland to secede and get their due independence from the UK. Next few years will be an absolute blast. I wonder how much less than the ‚Ç¨ the pound will be worth. Less than the dollar, quite possibly. Good Times.
anti	Can't wait for all the old people who voted for this to watch their pensions and social programs get slowly eviscerated, and blame the youth for their political ineptitude.
anti	Can't wait for food prices to rise
pro	Can't wait for no deal brexit. Should have said to the EU two and half years ago, wto rules or free trade agreement.
pro	Can't wait till 29 march when no deal Brexit happens!
pro	Can't wait to be free from 3rd world England
pro	Can't wait to be free of these bullies.
anti	Can't wait to become weaker and poorer
pro	Can't wait to leave the EU. Corrupt wankers.
pro	Canada, a child of Britain, has more sovereignty then the United Kingdom. Canada refused to be absorbed by the union to their south. The UK just gave up.
pro	Canary Wharf alone is substantially larger than the EU's largest financial centre - Frankfurt
anti	Cancel Brexit
anti	Cancel Brexit and the Tory party.
anti	Cancel Brexit please.
anti	Cancel brexit
anti	Cancelling brexit is the best option.
pro	Cancelling brexit means cancelling democracy. It means not giving people what they chose. It is a TERRIBLE, very serious precedent. I expect people supporting brexit filling the streets soon!
anti	Cannot believe it that people actually voted for an exit...
anti	Cant believe the English were that stupid to vote to leave the EU
anti	Cant wait for Scotland to the same to not so really united kingdom.
pro	Can‚Äôt wait for Brexit! We need to take our country back! If only we‚Äôd never joined
pro	Can‚Äôt wait for a new trade deal and closer defense ties with the UK
anti	Can‚Äôt wait for the financial crash after berxit. I‚Äôll be able to pick up a house dirt cheep
anti	Can‚Äôt wait to hear the leavers complaining that the remainers didn‚Äôt make them aware of the associated consequences in leaving the EU. All I will say is this ‚Äôyou‚Äôve got your cake, now stuff your faces and help yourself to some chlorinated chicken‚Äô. The fight has just begun and it will destroy the tories and hopefully the right wing media along with it.
anti	Captain blob a job has just steered the brexitanic into the iceberg and is now frantically arranging the deck chairs
pro	Careful madam Merkel might send you off too the work camps. No deal is the only valid option left, the main leaders of the EU have publicly said no way in hell can that deal be modified, if any of those leaders now change they minds, those leaders and their parties would lose all power in they home lands. Those leaders have backed themselves into a box they cant hope too get out of without losing, which has forced the UK In to a no deal, the only other option left too us is too stay and that would still force us too leave due too civil unrest like France is currently in the middle of. That's one lesson all UK MPs need too think of ATM.
anti	Careful with those facts buddy, you forget we have morons in this country that voted leave, wouldn‚Äôt want to scare them
anti	Carry on with Brexit and earn your place as the woman who did not listen, destroying party, the UK and our futures.
pro	Celebrate your independence Britain!
pro	Celebrations¬†üëç
anti	Chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn said: ‚ÄúWe are a global business with a strong presence in Europe. ‚ÄúWe have a rich heritage in the UK, with 30 years of manufacturing . . . Last year we produced more than 475,000 vehicles in the UK ‚Äì 80 per cent of which are exported. ‚ÄúOur preference as a business is, of course, that the UK stays within Europe - it makes the most sense for jobs, trade and costs. For us, a position of stability is more positive than a collection of unknowns. ‚ÄúWe obviously want the Nissan UK plant and engineering centre to remain as competitive as possible when compared with other global entities, and each future investment opportunity will be taken on a case by case basis, just as it is now.‚Äù
pro	Chance of a better trade relationships with other non-EU countries.
pro	Chance to increase trade in emerging markets quicker than remaining in the EU bloc.
pro	Change can cause hardships but change is inevitable, the eu was causing hardship and could have got much worse.
anti	Cheap #Brexit propaganda by using #Greece so stupid! #StrongerIn #StrongerInEurope #referendum #EUreferendum
anti	Cheer now, Cry for the outcome!
pro	Cheers Britain!!! Enjoy your Freedom from the EU totalitarians!!
pro	Cheers everybody. God Bless Great Britain !
pro	Cheers from America! Britain for the Brits!!

anti	Churchill believed in a United Europe.As a WW2veteran I know it would be a disaster if we left Europe.Let us work for a United States of Europe and ensure that future generations don't have to go through what me and my mates had to do.Dont listen to these Little England idiots
pro	Churchill would not have surrendered. He did not surrender to the Germans in 1940, unlike the current Conservative Prime Minister. The UK should tell the EU how it is leaving, not ask. That is what Churchill would have done.
anti	Claire O'Neill, sacked by Dominic Cummings on Friday from running the UK climate change conference in Glasgow, claims Johnson has provided net zero leadership. Britain fought hard diplomatically to run this conference as a sign of its post-Brexit engagement. Cannot afford this.
pro	Clean break Boris is what we voted for, nothing more, we want to go WTO
anti	Clear stuff. The ONLY alleged opportunities if Brexit arise from the ability to sign independent trade deals. That means if Brexiters cannot prove they are able to fix BETTER trade deals, the UK should remain in the EU.
anti	Clever name. That is all.
pro	Climate change? The climate always changes, directed by the Sun. Boris... That is a EU hoax. Leave that as well... Talk to China and India about their pollution.
pro	Clive Thomas, its the EU that will end up bankrupt without our handouts. If anyone cannot deal with life after Brexit then pack your bags and go live in one of the corrupt EU member states.
pro	Closing their border would be a good idea if it would be 2 sided and happend earlier. Imigrants counldn't enter britain and also british people couldn't exit their land killing people and ruin every place in the world.
pro	Cod stocks are almost depleted anyway, so there will be a price rise due to supply and demand. It's been unsustainably fished by french trawlers (allowed by the EU) in our fishing areas.
pro	Collectivism is not the answer. Independence is.
anti	Comb your fucking hair
pro	Come guys, vote to leave! I left my wife best decision ever!
pro	Come in...but you gotta pay a shitload. No thanks. Bye
pro	Come on Boris..I have faith
pro	Come on brexit we want out got it out means out
pro	Come on let's get out now no deal they need us more than we ever needed them.forty billion could do a lot for our United kingdom not Europe.
pro	Come on, UK! INDEPENDENCE!
anti	Come on, you has like 10% of the seats in the European Parliament, you have alot of power xD To make laws in European Union legislative procedure it requires at least 50%, so if you already have 10% you can make a big difference, just saying..
anti	Coming from a northerner we will literally go into poverty. Wigan and all the other high unemployment areas in the UK are gonna look like Africa. Brexit was a mistake.
anti	Commonwealth will soon be dominated again by one country but this time it will be India with over 50% of the population . The UK will be an outpost.
pro	Companies should pay enough to live off. Its crazy that people work full time in this country and that wage is topped up by state benefits. You might not like it but the fact is that is partly due free movement.
anti	Compare UK pre- and post-‚Äô73, more rights, better food & coffee, cleaner environment, even more wonderful students. No brainer. #VoteRemain
pro	Compared with the international market, the EU has caused people here to pay more for these things. Once the UK is out of Europe, people face cheap food prices, and they only have to pay the same price as anywhere else in the world. This is very good for us.
pro	Complacency and comfort are our greatest enemies. Being a part of a failing EU bureaucracy would have keep us in such a state until it was to late to do anything about it.
pro	Complete and utter tripe - our best chance is to get out now rather than sink even deeper into the mire. Revenge will come as we regenerate and the EU experiment implodes.
anti	Completely agree I'm 17 and the large of my age group/generation voted remain as you know
pro	"Completely baffling - 53% of voters want to see housing, NHS and Education disasters, an ever-expanding Brussels federal vampire squid, and a population in our tiny island soaring over the 100- million mark in the space of as little as 30 years. Are they MAD? As for a ""LEAVE"" economic collapse, it will take us twenty years to extricate ourselves from the sinking EU Titanic - unless it collapses beforehand - so why wouldn't the sun rise on Friday morning? REMAIN lobby beware - voting to stay only delays the day you will HAVE to vote LEAVE."
pro	Completely democratic. Proud of my fellow remainers!
anti	"Compulsive liar #LiarJohnson is calling the transition arrangement to carry on in as if still in EU until the end of the year the ""deal"" He literally doesn't care that intelligent people know he's lying as long as he can fool enough idiots. #LiarsGonnaLie"
anti	Condolences to the citizens of the late Great Britain.
anti	Confederate States of America anyone? The South decided to leave (like Britain) and it hurt their economy (like it will Britain's). I personally believe this was a stupid idea, but I live in the US where we already figured this out before.
pro	Congradulations Britain! Condolences to the BBC.
pro	Congrats & welcome back to sovereignty. The Special Relationship can now be fully restored, a truly great thing for the world.
anti	Congrats Brexiters, you've voted to make the country poorer, voted to drive out business and to leave this age of relative prosperity behind. I hope that blue passport (which you'll never use) will be of some comfort when you find yourself unemployed and struggling to provide for your family.
pro	Congrats Britain !
pro	Congrats Britain! Now clean up the refugee problem and you will resolve the Knife and Rape problem you have, first get Khan the Con out of office, he should be locked up along with the fake news that covers up the crime.
pro	Congrats Britain! You‚Äôre sovereign again!
pro	Congrats Britain, enjoy your newfound Independence!

pro	Congrats to Great Britain for finally getting it done. Long live the queen.
anti	Congrats to Russia for the second time in destabilizing the West! A hate it but I gotta admit you did it wonderfully and both times people in targeted countries are so obliviously happy about it that makes it hilarious.
pro	Congrats to UK. If England is democratic place then Scotland have hope to have their own independence day.
pro	Congrats to every Person in the UK. You will lead the way. After this we can hope that many others will follow. Once again the UK leads the way. You led the way in WWI WWII now you lead the way from another Globalest push. You the people of the UK demanded your National sovereignty back and you have it.
pro	Congrats to the British people....you beat the globalists.
pro	Congrats to the Brits from USA! You are no longer under the control under of the un-elected elites in Brussel. Don't let the elites trick you to get back into the EU
pro	Congrats to the Brits from USA! You are no longer under the control under of the un-elected elites in Brussel. Don't let the elites trick you to get back into the EU!
pro	Congrats to the Brits! If leaving the EU was such a bad idea, why did the EU fight so hard to make them stay? Obviously, the EU stood to lose more than the Brits did.
pro	Congrats to the UK and wish them the very best in their sovereignty and independence.
pro	Congrats to the UK. You get to be a sovereign country again.
pro	Congrats to the UK...a special time for the UK

pro	Congrats to the üá¨üáß
anti	Congrats! UK is out of EU. What will happen next. Country will become more expensive
pro	Congrats!!!! Hope this starts a trend! Independence from globalism!
anti	Congrats, i hope you all enjoy our economy going to shit, all major companies providing employment and investment leaving, our nations diverse culture imploding and our complete lack of presence in the international community. Just remember it was your narrow mind which brought it.
pro	Congrats¬†to UK - Independence Day!
anti	Congratulation to the ever-polite and patient Monsieur Barnier to point out ONCE AGAIN that the EU does not need us more than we need them. As for not paying the ¬£39 billion we owe, it will be a clear sign to all countries around the world that we are dishonest and incapable of honouring the terms of a contract. Nobody will want to sign a trade deal with us.
pro	Congratulation! EU it is failed!!!
pro	Congratulations
pro	Congratulations & respect for you and your party, you took on the establishment, media (corrupt BBC) and saved us from the clutches of the European Army. Thank you
pro	Congratulations Boris. I am delighted that the will of the British people has succeeded in the end. I originally voted leave, but I was so annoyed by remoaners I want to leave. More power to your elbow sir üëçüá¨üáß

pro	Congratulations enough brains to leave that oppressive European Union
anti	"Congratulations everyone ..... now we look like total plonkers all over the world. Can't believe that people didn't check out the full implications instead of swallowing all those divisive lies - smoke and mirrors, and bigotry. I read and listened to so much stuff that it felt like my eyes and ears were bleeding. If we thought we were desperate before the referendum, just wait and see what's coming. I'm too old to emigrate to anywhere in the Commonwealth (there's an oxymoron for you) ... sheesh!!! I'd love a referendum on the royal family though ...... errrm, no scratch that, so many damn fools would vote to keep them because ""She's a lovely old woman""."

pro	Congratulations on your new found independence!
pro	Congratulations to ALL Brits on getting your country back! I sincerely hope other countries follow in your footsteps. The EU has shown to be a failed experiment. It is the 4th Reich, and needs to be ended ASAP.

pro	Congratulations! Well done! The sane anti globalist citizens of the United States support and stand by our staunch ally as it Brexits!
pro	"Congratulations!!! Making Britain ""Great"" again! It's all about national sovereignty, self-determination, and patriotism! BEST WISHES FROM THE UNITED STATES of AMERICA!!"
pro	Congratulations!!! üéäüéâüçæ today u finally exit from EU
anti	Congratulations, Brexiteers, for doing your best to destroy UK as anything of consequence in the world.
pro	Congratulations, Britain! You made the right choice!
pro	Congratulations, my British friends, you've done it! Brexit is so close I can almost taste it and believe me - it tastes great!
anti	Congratulations. You just locked yourself in a tiny island, say Goodby to getting retired or study or work freely in 27 countries. !!!!!
anti	Congratulations...you ruined your country....
pro	Congratulations¬†couldn't be more proud of the British society we can actually wave our flag without being frowned upon!
pro	Congratulations‚ù§ Now  #MakeBritainGreatAgain &stop the Islamic Invasion!
pro	Congratz England!!Goodluck!!
pro	Congratz for getting your country's independents back soon.
anti	Conning people into thinking they were voting for ‚Äú freedom‚Äù or ‚Äútaking back control‚Äù and then handing over money to support idiot manipulators like Tommy Robinscum is just another form of slavery by the back door. More zero hr contracts, more exploitation by the ‚Äúelites‚Äù they fight against, which include Tommy Robinscum and Farage, who are coining it in on the back of Brexit
anti	Conservatives will destroy everything, literally, in the world given the chance.
pro	Considering how ‚Äútoxic‚Äù the EU were and how much they held against us I‚Äôm surprised people aren‚Äôt happy with leaving. Even if they wanted to stay in the EU, I feel they shown enough of their real intent to put people off staying in. But that‚Äôs not happened and to those of you who still want to be in the EU, after all that was said what kept you motivated to Remain?
anti	Considering that the people were told lies in order to vote for brexit, chances are that another referendum will end with a clear majority for staying.¬†If there is an honest campaign that properly informs the people on what to expect anyway.
anti	Considering the UK economy will take some time to reconfigure from plugging the gaps by immigration Brexit is likely just to mean poorer people will come from further away for the first few years at least. Irony is fun!
pro	Constantly trying to use misdirection by talking about business. We didn't vote on protecting rich business owners. We voted to leave the EU. LEAVE MEANS LEAVE! AND DOES NOT MEAN WITH A DEAL!
pro	Control of our own Laws.
anti	"Conversation between two shop assistants in the men's clothing section of a department store, overheard today: ""We've already started losing jobs, and #Brexit hasn't even started yet."" The penny is dropping."
pro	Corbyn is unbelievable, he will disagree with everything, , he needs to stop, we voted to leave over 3yrs ago, and it isn't right that we are still being ignored,
pro	Correcting a mistake ....... should never joined in the first place.
anti	Correction : Brexit is a terrible deal. Regardless which one
pro	Corrupt MPs are trying to stop Brexit !!
pro	Corrupt and failing EU man. I'm a staunch Brexiteer and had enough of following the laws
anti	Cosmopolitan London has no place in narrowminded, bigoted little England.
anti	Couldn‚Äôt we just use the existing pound coin which will be worth about 50p after Brexit anyway?
anti	"Count down to the end of UK herself. Scotland will seperate from UK, Ireland will reunite. No UK, no more Great Britain, only England. A country smaller than the size of Tunisia """"""""""""""WON'T"""""""""""" be a """"""""GREAT""""'"" anything. It will only be an overseas territory of the USA. üòÇ"
pro	Crash out , more doom and gloom , I thought the Sun was on the side of the majority of the British people and not the luvvies and big business that want cheap labour.
pro	Criticism from the 'plebs' is beneath Eurocrats. Time to get out of this elitist club
anti	"Cummings and Johnson are banning words such as ""Brexit"", ""Deal"", ""No Deal"". They want No Deal without Brexit being blamed. Use these words as much as possible online and in real life. They are brainwashing."
pro	Current polls suggest the UK would prefer a hard brexit as opposed to staying in the EU.
pro	Current polls suggest the UK would prefer a hard brexit as opposed to staying in the EU. Did the EU give you a grant for your video? It's biased in many areas! The UK is being punished by the EU for the democratic decision of it's people.
pro	Currently standing In Parliament Square, waiting for the celebrations to begin
pro	Currently, they have too much of a foreign influence on their nations policy. Leaving the union will give each and every British citizen more power in governing their own nation.
anti	Cutting off your nose to spite your face. Good job boomers, you sure showed us.
anti	"DEDICATED TO ALL REMAINERS TONIGHT: ""Just remember in the winter, far beneath the bitter snows Lies the seed, that with the sun's love in the spring becomes the rose."" You're not alone. It's not the end."
anti	DESTROY BREXIT THIS WEEK.
anti	DOWN WITH BREXIT, BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH, LONG LIVE THE EU,
anti	Damage WILL be reversed and those who instagated it will one day be held responsible.
anti	Damage? Membership of the EU has demonstrably been very beneficial to the UK economy.
pro	Damn it, the Brexit was the right thing to do, the EU is a sinking ship, get out before it drowns your country! Greetings from Germany.
anti	Damn it..there's NO COMPROMISE #BREXIT is INVALID. It's based on LIES. ILLEGALITIES & PARTY POLITICAL INTEREST
anti	Damn sight simpler to stay than to leave, that‚Äôs for sure. And better for our futures. What‚Äôs not to like? #RevokeArticle50
anti	Damn the brits rly did not think things thru before they voted. Or they were poorly informed
anti	Damn your way of debating is so inefficient no wonder your empire fell appart
anti	Damn... so it's finally happening. It feels weird somehow... Definitely one of those historic moments. All problems aside, it's definitely a sad moment for the project EU and for Europe as a whole. The Union isn't perfect and it definitely needs reforms in certain aspects, but the concept as such is a big achievement and we should fight to keep it going. Together we stand, divided we fall.
anti	Dang it were out now
anti	Danger of democracy - the uninformed voting for people as uninformed as themselves - leads to chaos,confusion, and little progress to a better life, individually or nationally.
anti	David Cameron needs to CANCEL this Referendum NOW. Screw public opinion because the EU is needed for our economic prosperity.
pro	David Cameron simply thought he could re-apply his Scottish Independent referendum project-fear tactics as a strategy for Brexit. Well, he failed.
anti	Day 1 of the campaign to join the European Union
anti	Day 3 of Brexit. Pound tumbles. He‚Äôs heading us towards an Australian, otherwise known as a no deal Brexit next year.
pro	Day UK leaves the EU will be great as you get rid of the madness little by little
pro	Dead dead dead, Democracy is dead. Stand up for democracy and deny the remainers and some others guilty of stealing democracy, and ignoring the True Informed Peoples Vote of 2016.
anti	Dead right utter nonsense Brexiteers have no solution.
pro	Dead right who cares what the EU want, lets just leave and keep the money promised
pro	Deal or not, Brexit is the way to go. Yeah! BORIS
pro	"Deal? - what deal? there is no deal.....just a load of rubbish thanks to May. She must go. We didnt vote to leave only if there were a ""deal"", we voted to leave....period"
anti	"Dear ""left behind"" brexiters, it seems the Conservative *do* have money for your communities, they just didn't want to give it to you. I guess you'll blame the EU for this as well?"
pro	Dear #Remainers, #Leavers are our teachers, our doctors, our nurses, our grans, our nephews, our neighbours, our volunteers in charities, our pillars of the community, our foodbank contributors. They're half of us. Disagree with them, by all means. But we have to live together.
anti	Dear Boris, I am unable to pay for the ex Royals security as my imposed TV licence has just gone up 3 quid and I can't afford both - plz sort at your earliest convenience, much appreciated old chap
anti	Dear Britain. Tonight, you will get what you've so longed for. We say goodbye and good luck on your false path.
pro	Dear Channel 4 not a SINGLE leave voter will vote remain. I will put ¬£1000 of my own money on a bet that if there were a second referendum the LEAVE vote will be MUCH higher. We've seen nothing but a political class spectacularly fail on leaving the first time and now our wills are like iron. You failed to do it properly the first time and we will absolutely WRECK you if a second referendum comes.
anti	Dear EU, give us a shout when we can come back
anti	Dear England, Thanks for fucking us all in the ass, you racist cunts. Love Scotland
anti	Dear Sons Today you lose many rights and opportunities I have enjoyed. I am sorry we let you down. Those that championed Brexit do not have the decent values you have. Remember who removed your rights as your generation seeks to rejoin the EU My apologies to you Dad
anti	Dear UK, Close your eyes and brace for economic impact...
pro	Dear brithish! If you can have a chance to vote then leave! The EU screwed over my country too when we joined. If there ever be a Huxit (Hungary), I will wote for leaving.
anti	Dear british, I have the impression that your politicians have totaly lost their minds. Putting the economy of a whole country on the line because of some stupid political BS is treason - or isn't it?
anti	Dear friends, if you choose to leave the EU, you will destroy your economy. You think you can leave EUs trading bloc and puff, you'll negotiate a deal and it will be just like before, only this time you'll be free... Frankly that's bs. Not only will it take years to establish new trading agreements with the EU and with third party counties(since Britain was relying on EUs already established trading agreements with these third party countries)
anti	Dear oh dear Brexit; what a complete and utter mess! And sadly this was all totally predictable after 23 June 2016. It was bound to happen when stupid people voted leave primarily to stop immigration to the UK (which Brexit WON‚ÄôT do by the way!) without considering the financial social and economic consequences of their actions. What Brexiteers did in effect was to sign a blank contract the details of which are now being filled in by the EU. What kind of idiot would do that??
anti	Dear oh dear, Brexit; what a complete and utter mess!
anti	Dearest Scotland, PLEASE get out and vote in the EU referendum. You could well be the thing that saves this. Let's stay in xx
pro	Death to the EU.
pro	Death to the European imperialists!
anti	Decades of ANTI EU media has brainwashed Brexiteers into the idea that the EU was bad...It isn't Bad but actually benefits UK in a huge way
pro	Decision 100% right.but long lead. after wells u.k fiancee
pro	Decision was made , Act on it no more excuses!
anti	Declining, declining, declining. Becoming irrelevant in the world to be ruled by world's past powers, China, India, etc.
anti	Deeming us racist because we opted out
pro	Definitely out, I want to see Great Britain great again and it won‚Äôt happen whilst we remain in the EU.
pro	Definitely was an out from me, and I'm young before people blame it all on the older generation ;)
pro	Degree apprenticeships can help fill post-Brexit skills gap
pro	Deirdre Clune the most invisible politician in Ireland! Once she gets your vote she‚Äôs gone until the next election, second only to Colm Burke.
anti	Delaying Brexit for a few weeks or months is neither here nor there. The damage being done to this country - its economy, global reputation and social harmony - will take a generation to heal.
pro	Delighted to cosponsor SNP MP Peter Grant‚Äôs Bill to protect the NHS from a post-Brexit trade deal with the US &amp
pro	Demand a full indipendent audit of EUs account's before we pay another penny to this rancid pile of filth!
pro	Democracy 1 EU Fascist state 0
anti	Democracy doesn't mean throwing yourself and your country down the toilet and pulling the chain. That's what Brexit is.
pro	Democracy has won.
pro	Democracy has won. This is the beginning of the end of the 2nd iteration of the Holy Roman Empire. May other Euro countries also desire from and democracy.
pro	Democracy in Europe has been hijacked by a group of politicians who have taken away accountability and brought in their own system of control. What happened to Greece was a foreboding , punished for daring to challenge the EU dictatorship.
anti	Democracy in hands of irresponsible unneducated citizens is one of a big nonsense.
pro	Democracy in the U.K. will never be the same again. Just deselect the MPs who are not following the wishes of their constituents.
anti	Democracy is under attack: They lied, cheated & broke the law to win the referendum. Funnelled ¬£Millions into pro #Brexit propaganda ads. Now they restrict access of the press to government briefings. This is an Orwellian nightmare!
anti	Democracy is under attack: They lied, cheated & broke the law to win the referendum. Funnelled ¬£Millions into pro #Brexit propaganda ads. Now they restrict access of the press to government briefings. This is an Orwellian nightmare! #FreedomofthePress
pro	Democracy will only be served when we're out of the EU with a No Deal. We did not ask for a deal, it's the EU's job to offer a deal and ours to accept what we feel is a deal. That's where May got it wrong in the first place.
pro	Democracy wins- despite three years of hard work by the establishment remainers trying to block Brexit, it looks like it's finally happening. I wish the EU the best of luck in the future but am personally glad the UK will no longer partake in the political project to create a federal Europe, led by France and Germany
pro	Democracy won in the end.
anti	Democracy's biggest fail. I hope they don't regret it
pro	Democracy, integrity, and self-determination win through at last
pro	Democratic UK will thrive and move ahead economically against the undemocratic EU bureaucracy fools.
anti	Denialism is the new mantra, Brexiters thought they would leave with better conditions than actual members of the EU and other countries would follow, well events have proved otherwise.
pro	Deranged lies. The UK is growing faster than France or Germany, despite the lies that they would be in a depression after the vote. Try to grow up.
pro	Desperate times for the EU. Brexit has exposed the political power behind the surface bonhomie. The EU needs to modernise before it becomes any more like the Soviet Union.
anti	Despite the Euroskeptics fear mongering and using false stats all the time. Never mind all the assumptions and poorly research 'migrant stats' that they love to reel off (fyi they are usually wrong).
pro	Despite the scares nothing much will change if we leave the EU. Except we will be free and independent.
anti	Destroy Britain's economy, leave the EU
anti	Devastating for the country I love.
anti	Did not know people can be that dumb
pro	Did you catch that......... Mr Rees-Mogg said he is willing to pay for it... Well I'm not, I would not give the EU a penny, they are keeping ¬£billions of pounds of assets which we paid for, there is no reason to bail them out further.
anti	Did you enjoy eating shhittt on Brexit day as you celebrated your gullibility!
anti	Did you vote #Brexit to ‚Äògive the establishment a kick up the backside‚Äô? Wholly reasonable! You have succeeded. But did you really vote for this? Did you give a mandate for this debacle? Time to Rethink? #FinalSay
pro	Did you vote to renegotiate our terms? I didn't.
pro	Didn't vote for it but I'm up for Brexit deal/no deal PROVIDING there's lots of useful criticism of it from the Lords or anyone.
anti	Didn't we say this would happen? And didn't #BorisJohnson assure us it wouldn't happen? But, apparently it's going to happen. We'll, I'm shocked! #LiarJohnson #ToryBrexit
pro	Direct democracy at last. Cry Freedom. FREE AT LAST!!
anti	Direct democracy doesn't work. It's like asking an english teacher how to repair a broken motor.
anti	Disaster. I'm ashamed of my home country and will seek Scottish citizenship now that their independence is practically guaranteed.
pro	Disgusted with Mogg putting his party before the country. It is law if we don't get a deal we leave with no deal has he said himself. So why all this rubbish about a 2nd referendum something stinks.
anti	Disgusting.. what failed us was the negotiators not the EU Shame on all the Brexit Bigots!!
anti	Division is anti progress
anti	Division is anti progress.
anti	Do I support Brexit in is current shambolic form? Absolutely not.
anti	Do I support Brexit? No.
anti	Do I think that the EU is a fantastic institution? No. But I think that the handling of Brexit has been a farce. All the lies that were revealed, and no-one is accountable. All the people at the top jumped ship leaving us with an unelected PM, and an incompetent brexit team. More than anything I wish there was some accountability for the bs propaganda machine, and I feel like a mug for wanting to believe the promises.
pro	Do it. Why have a union when you can have an EMPIRE
pro	Do liberals not understand that people can see through their magic, disappearing illegal in the phrase illegal immigrants? That's why Brexit won. Stop thinking you've a monopoly on being right. Some people value sovereignty over prices being a bit lower.
anti	Do not blame the trouble ahead on Nicola or the SNP. This Brexit is out of control. Own the trouble now
anti	Do not exit..be united with europe..wake up
anti	Do not play chicken with the EU.
anti	Do the british people really think that not being in the EU can stop the migrants
anti	Do the people who are happy to exit on WTO terms realise we would have the same access to the world markets as countries such as South Sudan
pro	Do the remainers not understand the end goal of the EU? Well I spell it out for them. It means the end of nations and all the diversity and freedom that brings.
pro	Do these anti brexiteers have any idea of the consequences of their actions? Possibly out of a job at the next election - or national unrest.
anti	Do us proud Britain; vote for cooperation, friendship & safety. Reject hate & xenophobia. Please. #StrongerIn
pro	Do we hell as like you morons. We had the vote, we‚Äôve had the result now deliver what the country voted for and get on with it.
pro	Do we know what to expect if we are kept in the EU? Continuous industries loss, job losses and ties into treaty of lisbon!
anti	Do you hate or pity Boris Johnson for the dishonesty he has used to get his way on Brexit. Upto 2016 he wanted to stay but then he asked whats in it for me and changed his mind to leave so he would gain at our Country's expense
anti	"Do you honestly think Brussels will give the UK a good trade deal post-Brexit? We'd be very lucky if we got anything at all. Of course Germany and France would want to insist on a reasonable one for their benefit, but how much of a ""good"" trade deal is uncertain. Also, Germany and France are the UK's largest trade partners after the USA, why risk jeopardizing this in a movement that is likely to stir political resentment?"
pro	Do you remember when we were promised that the UK would leave the Customs Union in March 2019? We should, because the Prime Minister stated so 23 times in the House of Commons alone.
pro	Do you suppose the doom-mongers who said Leaving the EU would bring ruin are feeling just a little foolish?
anti	Do you want to be left alone in an island with these politicians?
pro	Dodged a whole salvo of bullets by leaving the Ponzi pyramid scheme.
anti	Does Britain realise it‚Äôs been fucked? You still have to pay EU contributions but don‚Äôt have a say in the EU. Boris really sold this as a win in the country?
anti	Does anyone still believe that Brexit wasn't about joining a race to the bottom on standards and regulations?
pro	Does the name Anna Lindh mean anything? In 2003 Sweden went to the polls in a referendum on the euro the pro side were way out in front until the murder of this women. Goes to show the damage it can do I bet Cameron rubbed his hands in delight.....vote leave people
pro	Does this mean we can have our own version of 4th of july so we send up 2X the amount of fireworks lol
pro	Does your house have a front door? Why? Could it be you want to control who comes and goes? The presence of the door doesn't stop you from talking to your neighbor, working with them on projects, exchanging a few beers etc, but at the end of the day, it's your house, no one else's. Do you let your neighbour tell you when the door should be open?
pro	Doesn't address the fact that the EU is a already a sinking boat. Better to jump ship now while you still can.
anti	Doesn't seem like a great idea, but it's not my country. I like Britain and hope they do alright.
pro	Doesnt matter how you look at it,a no deal scenario is the best deal by far. Only then can we square up to the EU with a very good case for a free trade deal that is at least fair to the UK.
anti	Doesn‚Äôt matter anymore Simon. Brexit is `done‚Äô, Johnson has an 80 seat majority.
anti	Doire Finn attended the demonstration yesterday to give a clear message - Brexit will not be put in the way of our fragile peace process & a hard border will not be tolerated by any community in Northern Ireland. This is our future stability at risk!!
pro	Dom Cummings turned out to be a genius after all - and got what he and 17.4m wanted. Without him and Farage, none of this would have been possible
pro	"Dominic Raab will visit Australia, Japan, Singapore & Malaysia this week in a post-Brexit trade drive as Boris puts Global Britain into action! We've always been bigger than a star on someone else's flag. Now it's time to tell the world: ""We're back and open for business!"""
pro	"Don't be a fooled by terms like : "" EU Money, EU Grants, EU Loans and EU Funding"" it was our money to begin with"
pro	Don't be sheep and vote OUT.
pro	Don't blame brexit for this crap. This is just the EU being dicks and trying so hard to make it look like it's brexit...it's not.
anti	Don't blame the EU if you haven't succeeded.
pro	Don't blame you for not going along with the globalist. Congratulations on your Independence being regained best wishes for you guys and girls from the United States.
anti	Don't buy her lies as the only Brexit (as shown by government analysis)... the national interest is no Brexit!
anti	Don't call the UK a democracy if it allows any Brexit to happen.
pro	Don't care the price for freedom
anti	Don't care what they call it, just as long as we stay in the EU. Maybe we can then get revenge on the Tory lies and two faced talk.
pro	Don't cave in Boris, we are behind you. If you do you'll end up like the Labour party.
pro	Don't face up to democratic outcomes , wether you vote to remain or leave, you go by the majority, I've never voted cons but you go with the majority and we get what we deserve, it's called living in a democracy
anti	Don't fix it if it ain't broke
pro	Don't forget to take a BLACK pen with you tomorrow so your vote can't be tampered with! Vote LEAVE and let's make June 24th our independence day!
pro	Don't give up!
anti	Don't leave or I'll have to pay import costs from Amazon UK
anti	Don't leave us Britain
anti	Don't leave us Britain :-(
pro	Don't let remain convince you that they own all the smart people, they don't.
pro	Don't let them delay the 29 March exit, it's all kabuki theater to delay delay delay then cancel Brexit.
pro	Don't negotiate. We don't want you to negotiate. Just shut up and go away.
anti	Don't really expect anything less from anybody who voted brexit, you're all morons.
pro	Don't try and turn around Brexit. Deliver on what we voted for
anti	Don't understand why people are celebrating thousands of jobs have gone thousands too go...prices to rise in the coming years the whole world is a market place and the UK has decided to open the stall in the middle of the pond...ü§≠ü§≠ and we got America promising trade deals when no one wants their rubbish from cars too clothes it's no wonder they been trying hard to block Chinese 5g from starting up in the UK
pro	Don't walk away! RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN. There is nothing the E.U can do about it except beg . Don't give them two fingers,they are not worth one.Stand up straight for once in your life and leave E.U. NOW.Gain some pride Theresa May,they have been and still are taking the piss out of you and Parliament
pro	Don't want to be in a fully federal EU. Want to be an independent UK.
pro	Don't worry Herr Juncker the British people are all aware you and your unelected cohorts will make life difficult for the UK to 'teach the other 27'. There are plenty of developing Nations that will be glad to trade with the British we all look forward to paying less for our goods in the near future.
pro	Don't worry about the EU and trade. The world is a lot bigger than Europe.
anti	Don't worry about the health and well being of this country you might say? As long as we get our BREXIT? bloody fools!
pro	Don't worry. Don't worry. We aint all stupid. We will Vote OUT.
anti	Don't you realise that if brexit happens there won't even be a UK. Scotland will demand independence as the majority voted remain. We'll be half an island off the coast of a massively successful trading block!
anti	Dont be fooled by Leavers saying Remain have it in the bag! Please make sure you vote! Vote Remain #VoteRemain Its common sense #StrongerIn
pro	Dont be scared people of the UK. We will be stronger outside of the EU and we can use the ¬£350 million we give the EU to improve education for the next generations and improve the NHS for everyone including our elderly relatives and children who are most in need.
pro	Dont call yourself a democracy if you cannot handle the outcome of an election
anti	Dont waste your breath on a brexiter
pro	Dont we all wish Brexit would just happen already
pro	Don¬øt be like Greece which voted to stay in and have been taken over and pushed into the ground. Take this one opportunity to escape domination by the EU secretive power elite, and taste the sweetness of freedom and opportunity, leave austerity behind, get up off our knees and take back our initiative, enterprise, inspiration, and success around the world. Anything worthwhile is worth fighting for. Fortune favours the brave. Tim Peake did it in space, we can do it on Earth. Take courage and do it for all our futures. VOTE LEAVE!
anti	Don‚Äôt be so ridiculous, pat, this is the ugly face of Brexit - it is a philosophy propounded by many far right groups which can lead to attacks on immigrants.
anti	Don‚Äôt compare Brexit to jumping of a cliff either. Call it liberating ourselves from the cliff. We are free from the evil grasp of the cliff and free to move freely! Doesn‚Äôt matter about the lack of wings, we‚Äôll sort that little detail out later.
anti	Don‚Äôt forget the air. I breathed it in on Saturday morning and once I‚Äôd got past the carbon dioxide / monoxide, nitrous oxide and all other pollutants, the air just seemed more free. You can‚Äôt put a price on that benefit. Well, not until the Tories privatise air of course
anti	Don‚Äôt get what everyone is celebrating,
anti	Don‚Äôt hold your breath as you‚Äôll be dead by the time anything happens. Jeremy Corbyn has historically always been against the European Union.He‚Äôs also unfortunately been my MP for over 30 years although as a Green Party member I have Never Voted for him or his archaic unrepresentative politics.
anti	Don‚Äôt hold your breath. The true effects of Brexit are waiting down the road. Promises will soon become more vague and problems will be laid at the door of the E U. Having conned people that the E.U. has caused all our problems they will now have face the consequences. Can‚Äôt wait to see where all this money is going to come from to replace EU grants with a government that wants to lower taxes. Huge conn.
pro	Don‚Äôt listen to the remainers they have a extremely low standards ! Raise your standards high uk
anti	Don‚Äôt mess with the European Union
pro	Don‚Äôt trust the FAKE news! Trump has been saying this for years!!! Brexit is a GOOD thing!!!
anti	Don‚Äôt worry, we are free now, the way is clear to become a Third World power. With Boris steering the ship we can achieve this quickly and painfully.
pro	Dover and Out !!!
pro	Down with the corrupt EU üëé
pro	Down with the gay European Union. Sounds like the universal union from half life if you ask me.
pro	Dream on Brexit means Brexit.
anti	Drop Brexit is a another, perfectly good option too!
anti	Drop a like on my comment if you are like me and think Britain should have remain
pro	Dude, did the thought cross your mind that maybe the Brits actually just got tired of having laws imposed on them by people in Brussels they didn't even elect and just wanted their sovereignity oder borders, legislation etc. back?
anti	Dumb move by the UK.
anti	Dumb move, being made dumber by how they're going about it.

anti	During the election Jeremy Corbyn warmed us about the US hiking up medicine prices in a seedy trade deal with the UK & he was branded a liar by Tories & reporters all round. Well Jeremy Corbyn was telling the truth. And nobody listened.
pro	E.U KILLS SMALL BUSSINESS THAT FACT
pro	E.U. is lost empire full of Ex.USSR,we pay more in for their livelihoods, they are expanding while we contribute to their stability at the expense of our wealth and prosperity. Our benefits reduced, pension ages increased,wages on lifeline.Rich will always survive anywhere

anti	EU as an idea was great, i voted stay so im aware of all the great things about the EU
pro	EU bureaucracy can't help itself, a trade war is looming .. We must be prepared for the inevitable no-deal .. And we are ready .. Better a no deal, than EU submission.
pro	EU bureaucrats still don't get it, they respond to national sentiment with empty singing and catchphrases. More countries will leave and that will be better for Europe.
pro	EU can't seem to grasp we have a Brexit supporting Government with a big majority. You're not dealing with May the Remainer any more Mr B.
pro	EU council is the cause of Brexit
pro	EU fanatics don't know what they are saying from one minute to the next
anti	EU food standards are objectively higher than American ones.

anti	EU is changing all the time. And inside the EU the UK can, and has changed in the past. So what the UK could do is stay in the EU, argue for what it wants, win some, lose some as in the past.
pro	EU is controlled by multinational companies and their lobbyists influencing national politicians.

anti	EU is far more democratic then the UK . Wales , NI & Scotland have nothing to say , only England matters .House of lords = a bunch of non elected old men. House of common : The voting system : the winner takes it all is from the middle ages ( the knights !) only good for 1 party , the others have nothing ... democratic is a weird word in the UK.
anti	EU is not there to govern its members and has never done so. There are rules and regulations agreed and voted by all representatives of the member states. The stupidity and EU hatred fed by the right wing press in uk is mind boggling. Incredible.

pro	EU is talking about border when they dont want any borders and allow mass influx of illegal immigrants. The sooner the UK leaves this corrupt club the better.
pro	EU is terrified of losing the budget that the UK provides
anti	EU is the Best concept for Europe. An United Europe is good for the Europe and the World. If EU is gone...Russia and China will start their dirty game. So better that EU must exist.Sure it has some problems...but that can be Solved
anti	EU is the worlds best alliance of western democracies and the best model ever invented for peaceful cooperation between countries in Europe and a better future for our great continent. Never before have people in Europe had such opportunities to influence Europe's development and future. Civil servants from all member states including UK meet every single day and work together to find solutions on issues of shared interest. Truly a people's participation project and genuine democracy. I am so thankful that my own children will remain part of the EU family and I truly wish UK would review rethink and remain. üå∏

pro	EU isn't a good idea at any point.
anti	EU isn't as bad as some people would like to believe. I admit, there were some mistakes that weren't handled well, migration crisis that went out of control, article 13 and other things. But it still is the best project that we've ever had as a whole Europe, for never before in the history of mankind have so many states united under one flag. EU is a child in its infancy, it makes mistakes, of course. But you do not kill a child because of a mistake. You teach from it, you adjust it and make it better.

pro	EU look like Republic in the Star Wars movie
pro	EU lost its great asset now that the UK has decicided to finally leave the failed EU after four decades of committed British membership that has been one of the EU strongest nations. The vote to leave the EU will release the UK from a highly demanding EU membership instead shifts into a total UK focus of efforts, Finances , resources and people that have been previously provided to the EU . The massive annual investments made by the UK can be available for Britains sole benefit which increases the British capabilities to tackle issues, produce wide ranging positive outcomes for British citizens and help the enhancement of uk society in many ways promoting better quality of life for all British people. The UK will also produce returns in benefits, needs meeting and advantages for all people in uk

pro	EU rules from the Commission, Pro EU unions and their Anti-British sentiments, help make this happen, that's why we must get Brexit even with a no-deal, then we can outlaw these cave dwelling union fat cats and start to rule ourselves.

anti	Economic Suicide. Stop Brexit!!
anti	Economic consequences of Brexit are overwhelmingly negative
pro	Economics aside, brexit is a triumph for democracy in Britain
anti	Economists are unanimous, and have been for hundreds of years, that free trade produces wealth, and tariffs and other barriers make everybody poorer. So if Britain leaves, tariffs will go up between Britain and the continent and Britain will be poorer. This is the main critique of Brexit.
pro	Economy of UK is already very strong. They can stand on their own without EU support.
pro	Educate yourself about the EU..you may surprise yourself?....the EU is evil!
anti	Eff reaching out to the world. Im voting remain because its pure common sense to do so. If we learn anything from this, it should be less reaching out to the undeserving and more reaching out to our own populace
anti	Effects of Brexit struck home with reality today for our family. Brother in law, a hard working and productive professional got laid off. Uncertainty leaves bosses no choice but to cut back on costs so as to survive pending downturn caused by Brexit.
pro	Eh? How does the EU keep it's cards to itself? Von der Leyen was apparently tweeting out that the UK would have to stick to EU standards for a trade deal. How is that keeping your cards close to your chest?

anti	Europe should learn not any more to trust to islanders,especially from the Albion.
pro	Europe will still be united, but each country won't be completely dependent on the others. A nation must be able to act alone (within reason), and stand alone.

anti	European football will never be the same again
pro	European its just good on the paper and when they speak but action are far away of that :) like Farage say : We love europe, we just hate the european union !
anti	European nationalism and colonialism generated centuries of rivalry, conflict and war in Europe and in the world, causing millions of tragic and useless deaths. But now we know that sovereignty is not a fixed, static or immutable concept. It evolves and adapts, being totally able to accommodate a Sovereign Europe made of sovereign Member States. Only a strong European Union, based on human rights, democracy, free markets and the rule of law, can guarantee that Europeans are de iure and de facto sovereign in and over Europe and that Europe doesn't become a political and economic playground or battleground for non-European powers. It is sad to see the UK sowing those same old tragic and destructive seeds‚Ä¶
pro	European thuggery that‚Äôs all it is. Look back in history and see who they are WW1. WW2. Waterloo! Do I need to say more? They want our riches for nothing Go to Hell. Brexit was voted for and WILl succeed.

pro	Even if it brings war back in northern Ireland, time to put country above profit for once
pro	Even if was possible to prove that Brexit would shrink the economy, I would still vote to leave because I value freedom and democracy over a little more wealth.

anti	Every day that goes by Slowly remain seems to be the most sensible and obvious thing to do. Every day we are getting stronger and stronger in proving not on what we are saying but what reality is on the current world stage.
anti	Every day. And every time they try and justify it further, it makes me angrier. This is the single biggest fuck up by the government in my lifetime, will affect the entire country for generations and has zero possibility of anything positive coming from it. All we had to do, was remain. How can a government fuck up so badly and with so little regard for the consequences, even when they're staring you in the face?

pro	Every negative commentator on Brexit (ie Remoaners who are dismissive of democracy) assume that damaging tariffs will be imposed on the UK. Why is that ? Why can we not set our tariffs to 0% and expect reciprocity from the EU ?
pro	Every one needs to speak about what will happen if we stay in, the Lisbon 2022 treaty will see us lose the pound, Gibraltar and the Falklands, the stock exchange which will lose 200,000 jobs? What the hell are they trying to stay in for.
pro	Every power the EU has is a power confiscated from you. #brexit

anti	Every single person that I've talked to who supports the leave side has NO idea how the EU works or what it does for us. This vote showed the world just how stupid and gullible the British public can be - and here I thought we were better than the Americans.
anti	Every time I feel like giving up and saying ‚Äúlet them have their god awful Brexit‚Äù, some new hell or suffering emerges!
pro	"Every time I tell someone I voted out: There's at first a look of denial Then shock and disbelief Proceeded by a sceptical attempt to understand why Followed by some dooms day comments about the UK And then acceptance that the issue is not straight forward Most people didn't even know how the EU functioned politically when they voted, and still don't even know how it works now. I decided to look into it, and it's why, with a very, very heavy heart, I voted out. So, what exactly is the EU? As you know, it started off as mostly a free trade arrangement in order to promote peace (through economical interdependence). The UK opted in later, during the thatcher era! As time went on, it developed into a political union. Whilst not technically a federal union, it's pretty much heading in that direction. I'm not actually against that idea, I would like to see a fully democratic union. UEU or Europada? We could have a living wage across the EU which would solve many of the problems. So, what are the political structures and how do they work? There are three main ones with power: the Council, the Parliament, and the Commission. Council (""legislative body""): As I understand it, ministers from each country meet and can approve or veto legislation passed to them. For example, when trying to mandate free health care EU wide, all 28 (well 27 now) health care ministers would meet to approve laws). = something vaguely akin to senators in the US system. Parliament (""legislative body""): Every country elects representatives, the share of which depends on, of all things, treaties with your country. Like the council, this body approves/vetos legislation only. If they do not respond within enough time, the Council may bypass this body. = something vaguely akin to the house of Representatives in the US system. Commission (""executive body""): This is my favourite part of the EU (not!). This body is made up of 28 (now 27) appointed people, one for each country. How they are removed is not clear to me, if they even get removed at all. It's meant to be the EXECUTIVE body - think obama - but it is kind enough to handle creating all the legislation, trade deals and war/humanitarian decisions. At least it still needs to get legislation passed by the Council and maybe Parliament... which turns out not to be too hard when all your friends sit on the Council and the largest majority of representatives in the Parliament are, by treaty, German, French, Italy and Spain (Although the UK had a large chunk too to be fair). So yeah, our executive body seems to do, well, everything! And it's not even elected! The president of the Commission, who may as well be the president of the EU, is appointed by the 28 countries' leaders. (S)he has to negotiate with the country leaders for the appointed commissioners, but can assign them to whatever political roles s(he) desires. (S)he must be able to speak French (or France will shit a brick making life difficult for Germany). That limits our choice of president to France, Belgium or other vaguely French speaking countries in that area. What about the events happening in the news within the EU? A. Meanwhile, the situation in Greece is certainly frown worthy. Sure, the Greek government, and thus the people, mismanaged their finances. But to demand they make themselves so poor that young people end up sitting around jobless in their millions... I mean, do we really hate Greek people this much? There must be a better way. Greece cannot obviously devalue the euro to encourage tourism to help itself out of debt. We could subsidize it instead to make holidays artificially cheap there until their economy recovers, but the EU just won't go for that. Cos punishment is better I guess. B. Canada didn't originally want to allow Romanians and Bulgarians visa free access. Since the UK needs the EU to conduct trade deals with Canada, and trade deals must be approved unanimously by all 28 countries AND that neither Romania nor Bulgaria will agree unless Canada grants them visa free access - the UK was unable to ever establish a free trade deal. I think Canada recently agreed and will now allow the visa free travel. Thus, something that has nothing to do with trade had become a show stopper for everyone else, even countries outside the EU. C. Countries like Germany, France and even the UK enjoy cheap labour from the EU east for jobs that locals won't do for what is basically a nonsense wage for living in that western country. As things are much cheaper in the east, Eastern Europeans can easily send a small slice back to their families and it will mean a lot. I'm not against that in itself, but what I object to is that it hurts the local lower class workers in these western countries because if you live here and you're poor - who wants to work for minimum wage just to scrape by? Is it really that hard to understand why those we look down on as the thick, uneducated and lazy Brexiters are so angry by the situation? They themselves don't even understand the cycle that has been set up, but they just see that jobs they typically held have been replaced with immigrants. And hence it gives rise to xenophobia. D. Related to the last point, many Eastern Europeans, in return, enjoy the generous welfare benefits from these countries, able to send money back to their families even though they're not living in the UK and live in a country that has vastly different living costs. The problem here is that yet more money is pouring out of the country away from the UK rather unnecessarily. How is this a good thing for Britain? E. The EU has done a piss poor job of handling the refugee situation. Germany basically lead the EU into opening the flood gates without even consulting other countries. Many of the refugees are coming in from dire conditions to go onto waiting lists years long, as countries like Greece are already over burdened with debt. A proportion of the refugees are really just economic migrants from elsewhere than Syria - but the silly EU is doing nothing to filter them out, so they are contributing to the problem of the waiting lists and social resources etc, at the expense of genuine Syrians, and creating resentment of refugees. F. As for immigration, why has it worked so well in Canada and so badly elsewhere? Simple: If you don't have a decent education and clean criminal record, you aren't getting in to Canada! There's no immediate access to benefits (so you have to really want to move there for a better life) and if you commit a crime, you'll never get permanent residence or citizenship. This is how a nation of so much cultural diversity manages to exist in such a harmonious state. I'd love to see something like this in Europe, although we do need to clean our own house first, as it seems a good chunk of the EU is as thick as two short planks. How do I support such an idea in the EU? I have no democratic voice. And with a few unelected officials deciding to allow basically anyone in, on the basis that even mentioning the idea of a system like Canada's would amount to racism (a phenomena known as the ""regressive left""), what choice do I have? My mother can no longer go out to her local shop 350m away from her house after 7pm because gangs of foreigners from somewhere in the EU patrol and mug people who go near. One can see incidences of mass rape in Sweden and Germany and yet the police do nothing out of fear of being seen as racists. You don't hear incidences like this in Canada. Fin I find what a lot of these leave supporters are doing to the large amount of good foreigners in the UK an absolute disgrace! It's disgusting. I have at least three friends living in London who are from the EU, I'd hate to think someone would abuse them the way I've seen abuse lately. It was also why I had such a tough time voting. I'm pretty much voting against their interests, my families interests, my country's short term economical interests... I studied the issue for probably 12 hours total, even on the day I wasn't sure, and I'm still not. But can you imagine the bottom of the unelected EU boot stamping on the face of the UK forever and ever? I'm just not sure it's something I can say yes to. The UK is gonna suffer a lot for a while. But I hope in the end the social, democratic and other problems get sorted. It's a risk I think is worth taking. Edit: Italics show where I edited to correct wrong information (currently: how the commissioners and president are appointed) Just to add: my main reason for voting out is solely the lack of democracy within the EU and the unwillingness to discuss things like free movement and immigration among the EU politicians. The only reason I critise immigration as it works in the EU currently is that as someone who now lives in Canada, I believe Canada has a better system of stricter immigration that has lead to a better society."
pro	Every time Junkers and Tusk open their mouths it reaffirms the main reason I voted to leave
anti	Every time someone says they're going to pull out, usually a baby is born. They'll be back. Lol
pro	Everybody survived before the EU, Britain will survive after the EU.
pro	Everyday they care less and less about the world seeing the motives behind the eu. It's all about milking the cash cow.
pro	Everyone I know is voting leave. Nobody in England likes David Cameron because he hates the poor and is a criminal. If there are more votes for 'stay' then I'm going to believe it's been rigged. Nobody I know wants David Cameron anywhere near power.
anti	Everyone deserves to be free! congratulations!
pro	Everyone in Ireland needs to know what @simoncoveney is planning with this #Ireland2040 crap. Planning to import a million people from Africa. And don't be fooled into thinking it's out of compassion. It's for profit. #Irexit should follow #brexit
pro	Everyone keeps saying it‚Äôs going to ruin their economy but have we seen that happen yet? I‚Äôm curious to see what actually happens as opposed to what people want to happen. The EU seems to have a lot to lose by losing the UK.
anti	Everyone know that Putin is behind this and probably Princess Meghan as well.
pro	Everyone knows that the EU is weak and is going to implode on itself very soon, it's better that we leave now than later.
anti	Everyone looks on Britain, which was the country of a stable Parliament, with sheer horror and boredom
pro	Everyone needs to look at 1972 pre single market, Britain had it's freedom was a major player in world trade and was at peace with the rest of Europe, travel the same as anywhere in the world, then we joined the single market, 1st thing food prices went through the roof, then we was rewarded with a luxury tax VAT, then bent banana's were banned, had to convert to metric....the list is never ending
pro	Everyone seems to miss the point of brexit: the EU does not resemble a democracy and people want to change this.
pro	Everyone should leave the European Union. After all, its nothing but a useless union serving no ones interests
pro	Everyone that is against Brexit, should be moving.
anti	Everyone who is a Leaver and is well off, claims to have done it for sovereignty. Everyone who is poor has claimed immigration as the main issue. Well- off people who are prepared to take a hit in personal finance do it so the majority, the other, live a better life. People who are poor and know that poor people will take the greatest hit, dont do it so others have a better life. They want others to have the same shitty life they have.
anti	Everything about Brexit is needless, expensive, destructive and exactly what Putin wanted.
anti	Everything about Brexit is stupid, needless, expensive and exactly what Putin wanted
anti	Everything about it sounded corrupt and ill-informed. Risking the health of your economy and, more importantly, the integrity of you union just to curb immigration looks asinine and unnecessarily self-destructive. Good luck to yall
pro	Everything about the eu stinks rule britania rules the waves
pro	Everything is caused by the Globalist including all wars for control everything is controlled. even news media that spread half truths and lies but people listen to all the rubbish that is sold to us every day..people must wake up open their eyes and see the real truth. the plan is to weaken each economy cause many problems then they take control of all countries through the corrupt EU Control system were they rule with their laws above all of us...
pro	Everything we import why dont we try to make and export to the rest of the world, if we have to rely on other countries to function this country has been failing for years
pro	Everything you write just vindicates our vote to leave. I hope we see a huge surge in anti eu populist parties in the coming european elections. Brexit is going to happen one way or another. The eu's approach of showing complete and utter contempt for its members and thinking it can just bully them into doing what it wants just shows why it has no future.
pro	Everytime any of the EU leaders open their mouths. It just shows what a nasty bunch of power mad people they are. Desperate because they have been found out by people in the UK who wont stand for their elitism and want their soveriegnty back. They dont like the fact that they managed to convince other EU countries to change their minds on votes over things like the Euro and policy issues. Yet with the UK after nearly four years we have still stood firm.
pro	Exactly - LEAVE should mean leave but we have a woman in charge who wanted to stay. It was staged from the beginning. Why do you think May was put in as PM in the first place. We do not count. She may state we are out (but doing deals with them, does not mean out in my opinion) and all the while she is pandering to Junker and his cronies and supporting remainers as well...... she is trying to make it look like she is supporting leave but she is trying to please everyone. The referendum was a 'farce' and waste of taxpayers money.
anti	Exactly how I've felt every day since the referendum. My rights & opportunities & those of my kids are being torn away against our will. Am devastated at stupidity & arrogance of all those involved, & growing to hate my own country
anti	Exactly the same reasons here. More money for public services and NHS? Yes! All of the campaign telling us they had plans for a smooth transition swayed me from voting stay and voting leave so the money could be better spent. Lies. All lies.
pro	Exactly what we voted for..we never voted to be in the European Union.. only the common market.. now we're Free again
anti	Exactly. Brexit has never stopped being the wrong decision. Just because MP‚Äôs are insisting on it doesn‚Äôt make it right, or mean that we have to endure it.
pro	Excellent ! ...now all the useless EU bureaucrats & politicians will HAVE to actually work for a change in order to keep other countries from leaving as well.
pro	Excellent Boris, at long last we have a Prime Minister that wants & will work to do what is best for our nation & citizens whilst also working with other nations. Thank you, we now have a positive future & also for future generation
pro	Excellent I hope that this means that you lot will be replaced by some pro-british journalists and television show Runners maybe we'll actually get decent Doctor Who for a change
anti	Excellent and true. Fuck farage... and trump by the way! Kind of good friends‚Äô package, mmhh?
pro	Excellent result! Boris looks like he's going for a proper Brexit as opposed to Theresa May's fudge that was like some kind of French farce or Leonardo Vinci opera. I shall be having a drink tonight to celebrate our victory.
pro	Excellent result. Loving all the leftist tears.
pro	Excellent! Well done Great Britain! Bright and better future ahead. More control over everything. It‚Äôs up to the government now to make the right decisions
pro	Except now we have total and exclusive control over our political system. If people do truly want their rights they will vote for a party that will protect them. If not then they don't deserve them, simple.
anti	Exit Brexit.
anti	Expect a lot of criminals who live abroad, returning home.
anti	Expected, because the Brits are shooting them selves in the foot by exiting the EU
anti	Experts are worried. That's all I need to know.
anti	Explain how you think things will be better, and please, with some facts.
pro	Explain why the approval rating of the eu is going up since brexit
pro	Extra Time! I sense a stitch-up on Brexit by TM. No deal now please, without delays
pro	F the EU, they are a bunch of thieves, cheats and liars, get us out from under the control of the EU and its crooked courts.
pro	F#*king leave already!!!
pro	F* EU. Sorry I meant to say good by and best wishes to the EU.
pro	FACT: The British people overwhelmingly voted to leave the EU
pro	FACT: The EU has no money. EU funding = British money given back to us. Let‚Äôs #TakeControl #bbcqt #VoteLeave
pro	FAKE NEWS: 85% of British voters voted for a pro brexit party this election. This means that they obviously do not regret their vote to leave in 2016. And the EU is no longer a trading union but has become a non democratic superstate, ruled by unelected far left globalists. So sad.
pro	FANTASTIC we are LEAVING the CORRUPT EU.
pro	FCK EU
anti	FFS, if a country's currency devalues by 20% how can that be good for the economy? It shows a complete lack of faith by other countries in what you are doing. No plan, no direction, total chaos for something that will provide nothing that Britain did not already have. Britain will lose a lot, but will gain nothing. Idiocy. History will not be kind.
pro	FINALLY WOOOOO HOOOOO!!!!!!
pro	FINALLY WOOOOO HOOOOO!!!!!! No to the globalist elites!
pro	FIVE YEARS is too long.¬†We should be leaving now, not in five years!
anti	FORWARD EUROPE,UNITE THE UNION BECOME A SUPERPOWER
pro	FREEDOM DEMOCRACY SOVEREIGNTY VOTE LEAVE
pro	FREEDOM FROM THE TYRANNY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
pro	FREEDOM!!
pro	FREEDOM!!!!!!
pro	FREEDOM, BABY! YEAH!
pro	FU EU!!!!!!!!!
anti	FUCK BREXIT.
pro	FUCK YOU EUROPEAN UNION i did it for article 13
anti	Face it, front it, deal with it, we all know that Brexit is a massive mistake that will crash large parts of the UK economy.
anti	Faced with a choice between simple and naive myths and complex and ambiguous reality, the choice for most people is easy.
anti	Fact is Britain dropping out of the EU means that Britain itself is putting up trade barriers to the EU and that all treaties that currently apply to Britain today (via the EU) will cease to exist
anti	Fact is Norway is not part of the EU and still they can't control the mass influx of immigrants. Same as Switzerland, destiny of many economic immigrants from Syria, etc.
pro	Fact, it took the working class to do what was right, and you just do not like it. Suck it up losers, time will tell!
pro	Fact- Great Britain always wins in the end. Yes that's a universal fact.
anti	"Fact: People who say ""leave means leave"" with no further reasoning have no interest in preserving the UK, only destroying the current one."
pro	Fail to prepare, prepare to fail. This Government is preparing to succeed. Already they've engaged the services of 700 lawyers to oversee numerous trade contracts outside of the EU.
pro	Fantastic job Boris keep going. Just seen BBC interview. Keep battling!
pro	Fantastic news, this is just the start more countries will leave over time
pro	Fantastic speech, being proud to be British is becoming fashionable again.
pro	Fantastic. We have our country back. Make our own laws, not be part of a Europe going nowhere.
anti	Far from the quick and easy exit that Leave campaigners once promised, Brexit has become mired in its own internal contradictions.
anti	Far right fascists = brexit.
pro	Far too late to have grown a spine, should have been hard right up front. The EU will collapse soon enough, its piled up.on far too much debt and overseas buyers for their goods are drying up.
anti	Farage and his crew are an embarrassment to our country. Appalling man!
pro	Farage built a party in such a short time that will inspire and change the world.
anti	Farage is a liar! He lied to people just to win the referendum!... such a bad person...
anti	Farage is a prick and so is everybody else who voted BREXIT
pro	Farage is the man
anti	Farage lead the UK out of the European Union - and after he won the Brexit vote, he immediately fled like the COWARD he is.
anti	Farage the snake making a fortune from all this. Remember that he caused it too
pro	Farage will be remembered well by history
pro	Farmers and Universities need to understand that even after they receive their money from the EU - the UK pays more on top - so in reality its just the UK's own money being recycled with a fee taken out - why ? Its just a big scam that costs the UK billions every year - No Deal thank you
pro	Farrage always makes reasonable sense .. He has great ideas for leaving the E U and thats why Teresa May doesn‚Äôt like him !. Put Nigel Farrage in charge of BREXIT and it will happen !. Which is exactly what Teresa May is fighting against !.
pro	Farwell to the European Union. While far from perfect it had and still has very admirable intentions
anti	Fascism is now openly expressed in England... Soooo good for the EU to have gotten rid of you !
anti	Fasten your seat belt. We all have to live in this mess - but you can even congratulate yourself that you caused it.
anti	Fear and anger whipped up a bogeyman that directed attention from the real problems. The EU was not perfect but there were benefits to being a member. Issues did exist but not the ones most people complained about. The issues most people had could have been fixed by our own government and the ones they were not concerned about could have been fixed while remaining a member of the EU. People are generally not interested in bureaucracy though, it is also easier for those in power to shape the country without EU supervision. It was easy for the media to manipulate people as a result. The pubic got what it thinks it wanted and those in power got what they really wanted.
anti	Fear divide and rule. The whole country from bottom to top is antique.
pro	Fed up of those eu club rags waving ,for the bias bbc, I want my democratic vote honoured a full independent Britain and i want it now. Leave really do mean leave.
anti	Feel like doing one on Scotland? Looks like an interesting political situation is about to unfold, Scotland voted strongly to remain in EU and are now exploring ways of staying in - potentially splitting from UK.
pro	Feel sorry for remainers leaving the EU last Friday, then finding all your fears were just a load of project fear lies. Just joking the first line.
anti	Feeling ashamed and outraged seeing all the narrow minded , racist and nationalist people right now on tv. Having croissants and espresso for breakfast
anti	Feeling that Brexit and leaving the Customs Union is a tax hike, and the government is not interested in making free trade deals with anyone. Tax is wealthy including those who own the press instead.
pro	Feeling very energised and happy that we can move forward on becoming the Singapore of Europe. Cheer up BBC, I know you can change to include more diverse views from amongst your population base.
anti	Feels like Boris is holding a gun to the bus driver's head and telling him to drive off a cliff. Hopefully we can get rid of this guy in a general election and restore some sanity to this clusterfuck. Watch for the no-deal-blocking bill tomorrow.
anti	Feels like Britains effort at rebuilding the Berlin wall. Truly a sad day for everyone.
anti	Feels so exciting to finally be able to tear up all of our existing trade deals....and then have the freedom to renegotiate them all alone without the backing and market of the most powerful business union on Earth üëçüèª üá¨üáß
pro	Fellow Labour members. QUESTION: What is more important? The decision of a few thousand members at the last Labour Conference to keep a second referendum option. Or the promise we in Labour made to the British people to leave the EU who in their millions voted for us?
pro	Few days since brexit and the world hasn't ended yet then. Seems like project fear was all fake then!
anti	Ffs this is gonna backfire 4 sure
pro	Final Goodbye to EU, Brexit is complete. British celebrating their modern #IndependenceDayUK.
pro	Finally Breakup........
pro	Finally Brexit happened
pro	Finally Great Britain is free.
pro	Finally breaking free from the chains of EU slavery, well done Boris, the country is behind you. Your the MAN !!!
pro	Finally getting Brexit moving.
pro	Finally someone standing up to the EU and telling how it is. Well done Minister!
pro	Finally something good happens with UK..
pro	Finally standing up to the EU! Long overdue.
pro	Finally the Brexit is happening. Took long enough but finally UK is leaving the EU. Of course there some deal to make and there is a transition period that will last 11 month's (+year if they agree for longer transition period) but finally the endless nightmare of constant delays are finally over.
pro	Finally the Brits have reclaimed their sovereignty and security from the EU bullies in Brussels.
pro	Finally the English tumor got removed from Europe.
pro	Finally the day is here. #BrexitDay üá¨üáß
pro	Finally the wait is over.....üá¨üáßüá¨üáßüá¨üáß
pro	Finally their out of there
pro	Finally they came to a decision, hope things will get better for its people and economy
pro	Finally they get to leave bureaucracy of the EU and return to the loving and sweat free embrace of the monarchy.
pro	Finally we can be free of the EU grips and we can make this county great again
pro	Finally we're out of this abusive relationship.
pro	Finally! Now we can flip to the EU, the block of now 27 countries, population of 500 plus million, the largest economy in the world. `Coz we can do it! We are the British Empire! Chlorinated chicken, HERE WE COME!!!
pro	Finally!! It's been dragging on forever
pro	Finally, a country with our own democracy.
pro	Finally, a country with our own democracy. No more stupid EU laws
pro	Finally, a country with our own democracy. No more stupid EU laws like: Stiliton cheese cannot be produced in Stilton or Bananas need to be a certain curvature or dead fish thrown back in the sea because of quotas
pro	Finally, a country with our own democracy. No more stupid EU laws like: Stiliton cheese cannot be produced in Stilton or Bananas need to be a certain curvature or dead fish thrown back in the sea because of quotas.
pro	Finally, all countries should leave the EU
pro	Finally, it only took us.. 4 years
pro	Finally. :)
pro	Finally... the Brits have reclaimed their independence, their sovereignty and security from despotic bullies in Brussels.
pro	Finaly a country had the kohone to leave!
pro	Finaly, hopefully we can do things our way now, instead of taking orders from unelected asshats
anti	Financial analyst Derek Matthews told us, ‚ÄúThere are two types of people who loudly advocate for a no-deal Brexit, the very rich and the very stupid. If you‚Äôre not sure which one you are, take a look in your wallet.‚Äù
anti	Financially, the Brexit is... pardon the language, but it's bloody stupid.
anti	Financially, the Brexit is... pardon the language, but it's bloody stupid. Britain makes up about 5% of the EU's trade GDP. The EU makes up about half of Britain's trade GDP. So they must have unrestricted access to the European Economic Area or they're kind of screwed (i.e., suddenly have tariffs imposed on half their trade) Problem is, you still have to pay to access it if you leave so you don't have to pay EU membership fees. Other countries pay a huge chunk for this; equivalent to half or more of Britain's per-capita EU membership fees. And we haven't even started talking about the added costs of having to dish out farmer subsidies themselves instead of getting them from the EU. They're also screwing themselves over for a worse deal as well, if attempting to negotiate access to the EEA. Given the huge disparity in trading power between the EU and Britain, they (Britain) have no real leverage for negotiations. Furthermore, they'll probably generate hostility with the EU for abandoning them, so will probably face a much tougher negotiation than most other countries would.
anti	Find it genuinely heartbreaking when older people of the country vote leave and it's not even their future. #VoteRemain
anti	Find the silver lining. The brexiters will be screwed over more than we remainers. It's a toxic way of thinking but those idiots deserve everything coming their way if they haven't changed their minds yet.
anti	Fine sweet words by Boris Johnson. Pity he doesn't mean a single syllable. Bit of a Tory tradition this, but as the old saying goes, 'fine words butter no parsnips'
pro	Fingers crossed that we leave the EU in the morning then.
pro	First - Why do the nations of Europe need each other so badly all of the sudden? France, England, Denmark, Spain, Italy (Rome), Germany and others practically ruled the world at one point or another in their history and in every case that was achieved while engaged in all out war with the other nations of Europe - not allied with them. Europe has become a sinking ship and England just got on the first life-boat. Second - I don't now how Vox and NPR listeners feel like they are superior intellectuals when you are spoken to like pre-teen children.
anti	First British refugees in small boats spotted near the French coast
pro	First and foremost I voted 'Leave' for freedom as against 'Remain' in captivity. There is and never was any need for a trade deal.
anti	"First of all, I want to say that English isnt my native language, so sorry for the mistakes. For me, Europe isnt only an economic and a free move union, It is also an amazing project. People should realize that borders are a historic construct, they arent real. Why nationalism even exist? Of course you can be proud of your country, but thinking It is the best in the world and that its habitants are superior to other people...that is absolutely anachronistic. Why dont we focus in what we have in common? We all are humans, we should stop hating each other and start helping each other. You may say I dont know how world goes and that It is impossible, but like gandhi said ""be the change you want to see in the world"". If you travel (at least in other Europe countrys) you will realize we are the same. I remember a picture of Merkel hugging Holland when the terrorist attack in Paris took place. That picture was very meaningful, because France and Germany have been in war the XIX and the XX century, and now they are two countrys in peace, helping each other. I think is easier to believe that things can change instead of hating everything. By last, I will love to think that Europe is only the begining, that we are going to just one nation, a global one. That is extremly hard to reach, so right now I'm content with making Europe a country. (Of course I know It has some things bad, and I want a well built Europe)"
pro	First stop the endless defense ATL of the ideology of Islam, otherwise your are fakeliberals.
anti	First world countries politics crazier then ever
pro	Firstly I think the EU is a fundamentally undemocratic organisation. I've yet to meet a single voter of any colour who can give a reasonably honest and accurate explanation of how the core EU institutions function in practice
pro	Fisheries must be controlled by Britain, I know the Dutch are worried about it, what they dont understand is that the British industry was one of the largest in the world, it has been decimated by the EU. We want it back at any expense
anti	Fishing contributes about 1% of our economy. Only brexiteers would be stupid enough to value fishing over our services sector which makes up 80% of the economy.
anti	Following the Brexit virus spreading uncontrollably throughout the UK, bozo decides to import more viral ideas ?
pro	Following three years of turmoil, the UK is likely to have the most stable political environment in Europe for the next
pro	Fool Britannia. Good luck.
anti	For Brexiters it's all about fear and identity. Insecure numpties.
anti	For British citizens the British passport is the only one option for travel abroad. British passport is no longer recognised as EU travel document. You will loose all rights over EU and that is the decision of British people. They decided to become 3 party citizens to be independent.
anti	For Johnson, Gove, and the rest, it's now all quiet on the Brexit benefits and assurances front. All the promises are forgotten. It's simply doing the will of the people. Thier attempt to escape blame will rightly fail.
pro	For Justice - Vote Leave!
pro	For a country to be strong and successful it must make their own decisions. The UK by living the EU will be once again a country of leadership and respect. Congratulations UK.
anti	For a country with almost no natural resources, a need to heat in the winter, and not enough food grown for the population, the future looks... interesting.
anti	For a nation that prides itself on its football, this is the mother of all own goals. Good work you muppets.
pro	For all those who love the EU so much and are afraid of governing ourselves which we did for at least a thousand years, the solution is simple, move to Europe. DONT drag us down with your idiotic politics.
anti	For anyone arriving from Europe into the U.K. from 1st Feb, remember you‚Äôll need to adjust your watch for the time difference. We‚Äôre now about 30 years behind
pro	For better or worse EU law no longer applies in the UK. And we have regained sovereignty.
anti	For example the EU has over 100 free trade laws with other nations. It would take us well over a decade to become as free as the EU currently is.
pro	For gods sake , why have they waited for over two years for this possibility ! Even the PM said NO DEAL is better than a BAD DEAL ! And I didn't vote for a deal ! I voted LEAVE !
anti	For goodness sake see some common sense and cancelled Brexit before the country ends up bankrupt
pro	For heavens sake : GO AND VOTE if you want Brexit to happen!
pro	For industry, one of the worst aspects of the EU is their obsession with achieving consistency across all member states. Unfortunately this can rarely be achieved by raising standards appropriately across the board, so instead, European standards have to set at a low/average level, to suit the weaker players. For example, when the EU introduced mortgage regulation, this took the UK mortgage industry back at least a decade, with no possible benefits emerging for UK customers. (It was the technological equivalent of ruling that all mortgage lenders had to use Windows 98.) Yet the UK banks had to comply, and pay millions to change their systems and processes (a pointless expense, which the banks duly passed onto UK mortgage customers). Of course, the new mortgage regulation was deemed a success by the EU: its objective of introducing a level playing field across all member states was achieved, by bringing all European lenders down to the Lowest Common Denominator. Is it any wonder that none of the world‚Äôs top tech companies are from the EU? So glad we‚Äôre out...
pro	For me a leave vote will be my choice. I'd like to have more control over the policies in the UK and who we elect. Id rather not have 12 rich democrats decide what each country needs and what it doesnt. The European economy is on a decline at the moment and with Eurozone bailouts ahead it's more money we need to shell out for nothing. They say we'll have a louder voice in the European Union after this should we vote stay but with another 5 potential nations joining does that not dilute your voice even more? Then there's the murder of Joe Cox, I can't help but feel they're using this in favour of the stay campaign trying to make a martyr out of her and making you feel in a sense a murderer.
pro	For me it is not about immigration, it's not about the economy, it's about democratic accountability. The EU is anti-democracy.
pro	For me it was trade. The UK is the most globalised country in the world. We have have more direct investment from abroad than anywhere else. The Chinese businessmen, the Russian Oil Tycoons, the Arab Sheikhs have been buying up property and businesses in the UK for the last 10 years at breathtaking speed. It's seen as a safe and growing option. We are afterall the fastest growing G7 nation. Switzerland has a grand total of 27 Free Trade Agreements with 38 of it's trading partners. The EU has managed to sign just 4 so far. The EU with it's 28 voices and red tape makes negotiating deals a slow and tiring process. No wonder the Swiss enjoy such High Per Capita wages and great quality of life. Remember they are a landlocked nation surrounded completely by EU member states. If they can do it with the 8 million population. Then the UK with it's 65 million population, 5th largest Economy, and Rank 1 of the G7 growers definitely can. The future is bright. The future is Britain at the forefront of a Globalised world.
pro	For me it's simple. The UK is very different from Europe; in every respect. The happiest and most prosperous countries in Europe include Switzerland and Norway; both non EU countries. Britain had to sever ties with the Commonwealth as a condition of joining the EU. Sounds like shackles went on to me. We've tried becoming European. We haven't and resist at every turn. To prosper and be happy; leave the EU
anti	For me personally, I think that a leave vote would be awful for UK science. I'm a PhD student in Chemistry, and my research group is about 60-40 UK-'foreign' workers. We're funded by a Wellcomme trust high level strategic grant, so pretty important research. We have people from Hungary, Romania, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece. It's the same throughout the University. Leaving the EU would directly impact our ability to recruit top talent, and which would in turn reduce our ability to produce high level research - one of the UK's strengths.
pro	For me there are 3 main issues. First is democratic accountability - the fact that the majority of power within the EU lies in the hands of unelected commissioners. Second is economic - we are unable to negotiate our own trade deals and are forced to apply legislation such as the common external tariff, the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy. As the only EU country that does more trade outside the EU than inside it, we are disproportionately hammered by the EUs protectionist approach. 3rd is legal. The UK is tradationaly a common law jurisdiction whereas the EU is a civil law institution. Generally, I am in favour of limited, localised and highly accountable government subject to the rule of law. The EU is in many ways the antithesis of that.
anti	For me, Europe isnt only an economic and a free move union, It is also an amazing project. People should realize that borders are a historic construct, they arent real. Why nationalism even exist?
anti	For me, the most obvious thing that would happen if we came out of Europe (assuming Cameron gets his treaty changes and then holds a referendum, of which I am doubtful) is that it would almost inevitably mean closer ties to the USA. I don't want that.
anti	For most Brexit voters the poll was nothing more than an outlet to express their bigotry and their xenophobia.
anti	For most people Brexit will mean a poorer quality of life due to a higher cost of living with prices rising due to inflation and a weaker trade deal or no deal at all.
pro	For once the little guy won omg
anti	For our children and their children we should be facing the problems of the world together
anti	For our next trick we'll shoot ourselves in the face instead of the foot
pro	For some of us Brexit is about not giving up our power and law to Europe, not having a European army controlled by one political power, not paying huge amounts of money into a European pot.... it was never about race or who was deemed as belonging just us choosing who crossed our borders for our own safety and security and the security of all Europeans within our borders
pro	For the EU to prosper, Britain must leave.
pro	For the UK, it was the right strategic call
anti	For the benefit of those who think No Deal means we stay as we are, it doesn't, it means we leave the EU on the worst possible terms with the worst possible outcome. If you want to stay as we are then you want no brexit.
pro	For the first time ever, in my view, the arguments for us breaking ties with Brussels are looking more appealing.
pro	For the first time in 37 years the UK can be a UK!! A sovereign nation with its own laws, Monarchy , Parliament and endless opportunities for growth. An opportunity to grow manufacturing in the UK. GREAT TIMES A HEAD. The pound has not sunk. The sky has not caved in !!
pro	For the first time in a long time I feel proud to be British
anti	For the first time in history Britain took the wrong decision leaving Britain the underdog reluctantly conceding leadership to France and Germany like USA concedes global leadership to China/Russia alliance and decide to be the new axis of evil.
anti	For the first time in my life i am legitimately frightened about the future
pro	For the informagtion of that Dutch girl I voted Brexit not because of some newspaper story but because I know what the EU is.
anti	For those Brexiteers complaining about the EU, please don‚Äôt forget that you voted for this so please stop moaning about a situation you helped create.
anti	For those Brexitors, please don't count your chickens just yet. Only time will show you the real consequences of your decisions.
anti	For those Brits who got their wish, I hope you get exactly what you feel you deserve, no more, no less. For the rest, I wish you the best under your new circumstances, especially those in the fields of science and technology who thrive on collaboration and cooperation. No nation is an island, not even the U.K.
pro	For tonight the U.K. is building up its flood defences to cope with the amount of remain saltiness flowing at 11pm. Happy Brexit Dayüá¨üáß
pro	For us it was what we voted for and was not a mistake. For the EU it was a mistake because if they had given a little something to David Cameron then I have no doubt we, the UK would have voted to remain. Thank god they did not give us anything!
pro	For wealthy countries, such as the UK, the cost of being a member of the EU is greater than the benefits
pro	For what we sell to Europe it will be a very rewarding time for Great Britain to have a World wide market without the EU
anti	"Forever divided, we leave. So sad. To the elderly, I say ""We cannot believe you would throw your children under the bus."" But you did.We will deal with the mess. Thank you"
anti	Forget drops. Drop BREXIT. Best bet for Britain is to stay with the EU.
anti	Forget the markets. London will plunge into a deep recession if brexit passes, it will be worse than the one that hits the countryside.
anti	Forgive me but I feel the fight has now gone beyond flippant humour. The UK is in serious deep shit with Brexit
pro	Former Remainers are most definitely now argueing for ‚Äôsoft brexit‚Äô as a way to subvert the democratic decision of June 23.
anti	Fox describes no deal as ‚Äúsurvivable ‚Äú. Not exactly glowing with confidence. A nuclear bomb is survivable , cancer is survivable as are most car crashes.
anti	Fox news supports it Ok now i'm worried
pro	France has accepted we're leaving and is preparing for a No Deal exit. So should we. Let's get on with it. No Deal, no problem
pro	France is the next! EU is a failure proyect we are worse than in the past
pro	Frankly I am amazed that these MPs are still walking about freely without massive protection after what they are doing!Its called treason!
pro	Frankly I prefer to be dictated to & ruled over by people of my own country than foreign ones. That's Brexit in a nutshell & why I voted to Leave the EU.
pro	Frankly we need to disband any type of government body that attempts to set laws for multiple countries, like the EU and the UN, we need to let countriemen decide what goes on in their own country
pro	Free at last ,free at last , thank god almighty free at last ...
pro	Free at last, Free at Last...
pro	Free at last, free at last, praise God almighty they're free at last!
anti	Free from what? Free to do what?
anti	Free movement has shown to be very good for both businesses and academia. It introduces diversity in approaches and ways of thinking, encouraging innovation and creativity, as well as business growth. An internationally acclaimed economy, needs international input if it is remain at the forefront of the world stage.
pro	Free of the shackles of the corrupt anti democratic EU at last. Hopefully more member states will follow the UKs lead and bury the bloc for good.
pro	Free to do what we want to do. Yippee
pro	Free to set our own laws, Brexit should act as a catalyst for a new era of prosperity for an outward-looking U.K. ambitious in removing barriers to trade, enterprise and economic growth.
pro	Freed from restraints in Europe, Britain could rebuild ties with natural English-speaking allies in the Commonwealth and strengthen the Special Relationship with the United States.
pro	Freedom U K
pro	Freedom again!!!!
pro	Freedom and independence from the EU should lead to wealth.
pro	Freedom at last !! UK for the British !!! Independent, well DONE all who fought against the global establishment !!
pro	Freedom at last.
pro	Freedom for the People, we are now a Sovereign Nation again!!!
pro	Freedom from petty, foreign, unelected, pathetic politicians, EU rules, regulations, controls and inward-looking socialist, neo-progressive, liberal Europeans. I'm good with that.
pro	Freedom is what it's about. F the EU.
pro	Freedom of movement must be great for security.
pro	Freedom of movement should be the first thing we stop!!!
pro	Freedom over fear! Brexit now!
anti	Freedom requires morality and a sense of common purpose. The UK doesn't have that anymore.
pro	Freedom self determination
anti	Freedom to trade outside the EU sounds great in theory but in practice I imagine it will be much harder than any Brexiteer cares to admit.
pro	Freedom, Independence, National Sovereignty, Democratic Accountability: These things are much more worthy preserving and important than any possible, temporary economic disturbance or loss!!!
pro	Freedom, sovereignty, self-determination. The biggest day in British history since the end of World War Two, and a huge victory for liberty
pro	Freedom¬†üòÄ
pro	Freeeee Britain yeaaaaaaaaaa
anti	French fishermen face DISASTROUS 'shortfall' if blocked from British waters. I
pro	From 2021, UK citizens and interests will be represented by... UK citizens.
anti	From Europe mainland point of view, the Brexit situation looks quite hilarious. Now, Corbyn has a good opportunity to become next UK's PM
pro	From a Europeans point of view (who lived in UK for 15 years ) I really wish the UK would leave
anti	From a different perspective, I am a Welsh nationalist and will be voting to Remain because Wales would be on the brink of an economic collapse if we leave the EU. We get significantly more out of the EU than we put in, purely financially, and I have no faith whatsoever in the UK Government to replace that funding. We get so much out of the EU because we have some of the highest poverty levels in the whole of Europe - the London-centric UK Government seemingly has no interest in rectifying the structural reasons for Wales' poverty and poor economic performance. Alongside that, I think the EU is fundamentally a force for good in the world. Freedom of movement and a peaceful, stable Europe are two achievements that cannot be underestimated, and although I do not agree with everything the EU stands for (TTIP, for example, is a nightmare) I want Wales to play its part in it. Regardless of the way the UK votes on Thursday, my long term aim is for Wales to be a Member State of the European Union in its own right.
anti	From having control of our borders To not having control of our borders #Madness Need a #PeoplesVote And prosecution to #Brexiteers who lied, misled and damaged our nation.
anti	From here it seems like Britain is screwed, and I just keep wondering why those people are doing that to themselves.
anti	From now on, Brits are no longer EU citizens. They've lost all the rights, protections & benefits that come with EU membership. Half a billion neighbours have those rights. But UK Leavers have sold ours for a blue passport and a 50p piece.
anti	From the French, we urge you to remain! Would you rather listen to Farage and Boris or the leading economists and world leaders?
pro	From the Netherlands: Congratulations with your regained freedom. Tonight you will be free of EU slavery!!!!!
pro	From the US - Congratulations on saving your country. I have complete confidence the British people will prosper.
pro	From the beginning ever since 1992 I can see EU is a failure.
pro	From the common market to the commonwealth
anti	From this day on, dear leavers, it‚Äôs all your fault.
pro	From where I sit in Australia, I cannot think of one good reason why the UK would stay in the EU.
anti	Fuck #BrexitDay
anti	Fuck Boris Johnson. Fuck Trump. Fuck Brexit. Fuck Katie Hopkins. Fuck Farage. Fuck Rees-Mogg. Fuck all this toxic, nationalistic, elitist anti-elite, paradoxical populist dumbass simplistic reactionary militaristic dangerous xenophobic bollocks. Send them away on a big lying bus.
anti	Fuck Brexit
anti	Fuck Brexit and all the little englanders.
anti	Fuck Brexit and everything it stands for.
anti	Fuck brexit
anti	Fuck brexit.
anti	Fuck brexiters!!..hope you fucking rot in your own shit when you leave Europe...you can't have your cake and eat it,you fuckers!!!
anti	Fuck my shitty country
pro	Fuck the EU! Long live the UK!
pro	Fuck the EU, just get out! You have my blessing! I hated being a tourist in Britain with Eastern Europeans all over the place!
pro	Fuck the EU.
pro	Fuck the remoaning traitors they didn‚Äôt want to hear the results of the vote either ..they need to grow up it‚Äôs called democracy or tough shit .. either one works
anti	Fuck you #Brexit supporters.My best friend of a decade, my bridesmaid, who has lived & studied here since she was a child, has just been contacted by the Home Office. They want proof of residency in the UK.Fuck you all. Bunch of fucking cunts, the lot of you.
anti	Fuck you Boris and fuck you Farage!
anti	Fucking Brexit - I hate you.
anti	Fucking stupid, the last spiteful act of a generation of geriatric Little Englanders, abetted by the venal incompetence of the Conservative Party. But I think we're stuck with it now and calls to reverse the decision are pointless. Likely outcome is a few years in the wilderness, then if the EU is still around 10-15 years from now we'll meekly rejoin.
anti	Fucking worse, its unlikely we will remain in the single market which is going to make it far harder to travel to Europe, like Trumpageddon its empowered the alt-right scum who are now ramping up racist and homophobic agendas in the place.
anti	Fun fact: If Brexit meant that Britain would be taking more migrants in than before 95% of leave voters would‚Äôve voted remain. Why? Because the main reason for the idiots who still think Brexit is a good idea is those who only voted out because Nigel Farage promised fewer migrants never mind the benefits that where also promised like the millions that would go to the NHS which was like many others a load of BS. No intelligent Brexit voter would still be sticking to Brexit.
pro	"Fundamentally I don't want Britain to be part of a European political union, and don't trust our political class to keep us from further integration. I didn't see Remain as anything more than a temporary ""status quo"" option and our apparent ""opt out"" from ever closer union wasn't worth the paper it was written on."
pro	Funny I saw a poll in last week‚Äôs DT that quoted 58% now want to leave. And by the way child, not leaving is illegal.
anti	Funny how Brexiters always talk about fishing and never about farming and agriculture once we come out of the transition we are now in.
pro	Funny how it couldn't be done according to Eyore and Treason May. Well done Boris!
anti	Funny how little the media has ever bothered to examine the perspectives of the other EU nations in all this. It's all about what's good or bad for us,nobody seems to give a shit what harm it may do to our friends and neighbours.
pro	Funny how the EU are now starting to ask us for things... how the tables have turned
pro	Funny how the leavers are called the racists when it's us who want to engage with the rest of the world rather than just white Europe.
pro	Funny isn't it, we were told by politicians and experts we were going to have emergency taxation if we voted Brexit because of uncertainty. In three and half years of Brexit uncertainty, Britain is booming and EU are in recession.
anti	Funny like no one like the brits, not even the people from Wales or Scotland which forms part of the united 'forced' kingdom. Funny no
pro	Funny that, isn't it? The EU trading block is actually the worst economy in the world at the moment with barely any growth... even places like western africa have better economic growth.
anti	Funny thing about Brexit Logic is its selective denial/adoption of logical reciprocity.‚Ä¶
anti	Funny to see the same country that everyone else fought to be freed from now celebrating their independence!
pro	Funny you all hate the UK but still want to migrate here.
pro	Further reason to leave the eu

pro	GOOD. the UK now has its nation back.
pro	GOOOOOD JOB! The EU must collapse
pro	GTFO, they‚Äôre always slowing every reform down with their common law gibberish!
pro	GUYS! IT HAPPENED! THE BRITS WON!
anti	Gams don't do evidence or reason. That's why Brexit is going to fail.
pro	Gee the BBC just can't hide their bias and disappointment that white unelected elites no longer control Britain.....The EU has been exposed for exactly what they are.....sucko!!!
anti	Genuinely I am thinking of moving country because of this, people here have become unbearable to work and live with.
anti	Genuinely I hope this all gets sorted, that somehow we end up remaining and you can get to come back to your new found home safely.
pro	German welcome migrants because they knew they most of them wont stay but move to the U.K just as France,spain and italy.
pro	Germany and the UK should leave the EU together!Good luck to UK from Germany.
pro	Germany has 100% control over Europe. Britain won the War BUT Germany wins Europe
pro	Germany have finally taken over Europe but they didn‚Äôt have to kill a single person this time. Very impressive. GET ME OUT!
pro	"Germany will quickly discover that it was actually the British, not the French, who were their strongest allies in the EU ... at least on the free trade front. Other than Germany with its export-oriented economy, the remaining EU countries that support free trade are actually tiny, import-dependent countries. Other than France, the remaining ""large"" countries in the EU are depressed basket cases like Italy and Spain, while the rest of the EU is former communist countries hungry for development funds but otherwise hostile to the entire thing."
anti	Germany won. Britain is lost some fools even reminded ''rule Britania'' while no more colonies to exploit, no natural resources or big industries. Its byebye little Britian.
pro	Get England out of the EU #brexit #noEU
pro	Get a backbone Mrs May, stop wasting time and just LEAVE. Do what we voted for. You are so weak. The worst PM ever. At least Thatcher has some balls. She wouldn't have stood for any of their nonsense, why are you?
pro	Get away from eurocratic money wasters that all bow to the whims of Germany, and even many of their people want out too! We want to make our own sensible laws, have a say in how our money is spent
pro	Get away from this toxic eu dictatorship out now
anti	Get him sacked, end the referendum silliness and keep Britain IN!
pro	Get it bloody done !! if parliament try stop it kick them where it hurts!!!!

pro	Get out so we can get on
pro	Get out while you can
pro	Get out while you can England!!!
pro	Get out while you can.
pro	Get out. Brits are better off EU. Britain doesn't need othet nations to survive.
pro	Get over it and start building our country up again instead of constantly spreading gloom! We actually managed to live ok before the EU.
anti	Get real UK,...no more freeloading for you lot, you're out, now get lost.
pro	Get rid of the Eu club and end food banks.
pro	Get rid of the Eu club and end food banks.?
pro	Get the hell out of the EU, they will play you for years to come.s Get the hell out !
pro	Get the immigration stopped then it will be a real Brexit send 80 per sent back crime will stop houses will become available to British people all that rubbish I hear about we need them ect 90 per cent of the ones they have moved into my area are claiming benefits and robbing the system and running about in disability cars they are treating us like fools
pro	Get those rubbish eu flags turned into bin liners
pro	Get us out now!
pro	Get us out of the union!!
pro	Get us out!
anti	Getting Brexit done is worse than making an IKEA bed.
pro	Getting Brexit done, in the sense of leaving the European Union was, in a way, the easy bit
pro	Getting out of the EU can be quick and easy ‚Äì the UK holds most of the cards
anti	Gibraltar, Scotland, Ireland all voted to stay in the EU. They should be allowed to stay. England will be the nation that breaks the UK apart.
anti	Give it a few months until the consequences of leaving the EU start to sink in. For example, the British immigrants living in Europe who voted to end their own freedom of moment, their access to free healthcare and the loss of their pension rights. Being a third country is not going to be a whole heap of fun especially when the expats all start moving back to Blighty! Where are they all going to live?
anti	Give it up. It's a bad deal. After they first voted on the referendum, what was it 3 years ago, most people now think it was the wrong thing to do and they are against it.
pro	Give the EU an invoice for the infrastructure we funded and will leave behind. Gott in himmel they are so arrogant. Do not answer the phones for a month after Freedom Day.
pro	Give the EU nothing!!!!!!!!!!
pro	Give the EU the big middle finger by calling President Trump and hammering out a deal within a week.
pro	Give the above, stopping Brexit simply is not an acceptable democratic option
pro	Give the whiny 48% what they want and let's be the Social Justice Soviet Union.
pro	Give them a one way ticket to Brussels if they want to stay in. Simples!
anti	Give us few days of no deal and Brexiteers will run begging for any kind of deal. You haven't seen anything yet. Brexit is a catastrophe
pro	Give us our country back is all we want and voted for
pro	Give us what we voted for, No Deal WTO actual Brexit
pro	Given that i know nothing at all about trade and commerce, i can say that i do know about what it is that i and 17.4 million voters want at this particular time in our history, and that is--TO LEAVE THE EU.
pro	Given the right to - given the opportunity to vote, I voted for Brexit because I've never approved really of the European Union, I never approved of it because of its attempts to confiscate national sovereignty in all the issues that matter.
pro	Glad the people who live there got a say in what happens to their country. I would have voted to leave if I lived there, so I agree with their vote. But I'm not a citizen there so my opinion does not matter.
pro	Glad they listened
pro	Glad to be out of Europe hope they suffer
pro	Glad to get rid of EU control, they are gonna struggle without the UK
anti	Glad to see America is not the only country with lots of idiots in it
anti	Glad to see that Justin Tr'udeau is adding his perspective to the debate. Hopefully a majority of Brits will heed the warnings of Britains friends and allies and vote to remain.
pro	Glad we are leaving as most of Britain is
pro	Glad we left!
anti	Global Britain - soon to be a provincial backwater thanks to the tories.
pro	Globalisation serves the rich
pro	Globalism is a cult presided over by self-serving corrupt pigs.
pro	Globalism is dying! Thank goodness.
pro	Globalism is dying. Protect your culture get out of the Eu poison
pro	Globalism is slavery, central banking, common currencies, centralized government, corporate collusion in politics, flooding Europe with immigrants who detest our way of life, divide and conquer, order and enslavement out of chaos. Doesn't anyone understand the end game? The UK will bounce back economically in three weeks. This decision is historically the beginning of the end of Globalism. Be proud of it.
pro	Globalism just benefits big corporations. Only National govetnments can have theit peoples best interests at heart, not Brussels bureaucrats.
pro	Globalism losing. CONGRATS U.K. !!!!
pro	Globalist are enemy of the people
pro	Globalist puppet
pro	Globalists are doomed .

pro	Go Britain! The EU has been holding you back and holding you hostage....
pro	Go UK. Get your citizens to look at Brittian's history. You have a great country. Now take back your sovereignty. Get your fishing rights back. Raise the national flag. Do not listen to those naysayers.
pro	Go ahead with Brexit maybe one day we'll see an ItalianExit.
pro	Go back, why would any country on God's earth which to be part of this disgraceful EU set up. We are free and I would imagine there are others watching us very closely. We will succeed and come out of this nightmare with our country, pride and sovereignty.
pro	Go boris
pro	Go boris we are behind you all the way
pro	Go for it Boris, we have much more hope now. Get that good deal, we're off!
pro	Go for it Boris. Get it done
anti	Go home Brexit you're drunk
anti	Go on. Explain one economic issue that will be better after Brexit
pro	Go, Brexiteers, Go! Vote the Oxbridge globalists out of office!
anti	"God I cannot believe how stupid some of these responses are. Brexiteers are living in ""make believe world"" fuelled by posh boys' petty political ambitions. This BREXIT nonsense is happening and will hurt us all ...FACT not FALSE NEWS or SCAREMONGERING."
pro	God I'm glad you are out of our union. Hope it works out for you, but the constant complaining was getting on my nerves. You are not even part of the continent, why were you in the EU is beyond me.
pro	God Protect Britain from Radical Islam... Lots of Love For Britain and Brittons From India...

pro	God bless the UK. God bless USA. God bless Nigel Farage. God bless Donald Trump. Trump 2020. MAGA
pro	God bless you freedom lovers everywhere!!! Congratulations!!!
pro	God bless you you have taken your country back
anti	God damnit how did this get passed? Is this the work of crusty, aging, angry people who wont have to live through the fallout of this decision? My dads side of the family emigrated to Canada from England a long time ago but I still feel bad for what's coming to anyone left behind.
anti	God said he is going to send down Noah to build a big ark to save 2 of everything British Cos Brexit is gonna make us sink into the channel lol .AFTER the fire and brimstone of course.

anti	God to be able to go back to the days when the worst thing a politician could do to this country was the inelegant consumption of a bacon sandwich.
anti	God you Brexiters talk shite. It's like some induced dream you all live in, which is why the divisions brewing in this nation will only worsen.
pro	God, it makes me so happy to see true, patriotic Brits (and non-Brits) rebutting this buffoon and his platitudes, and backing Brexit. Brexit is the only way we can save our country from the globalist nightmare that awaits Europe. Controlling immigration, being sovereign, trading with the world and rejecting cultural Marxism are all things to be proud of, and things any sane person wants - these things will be achieved with a Brexit vote.
pro	Goid luck with it all I voted leave and leave we are
anti	"Going the wrong route. Should cancel this self destruct button knows as ""Brexit"". Only chaos waits UK now. Its like committing suicide knowing the consequences."
anti	Going through with Brexit as it stands now is simply stupid, there's no suggarcoating it
pro	Gonna miss Farage's speeches in the EU parliment. Won't miss the EU though.
anti	Gonna miss my Europe buddies.. :/
pro	Good , WE VOTED TO LEAVE . goodbye .
anti	Good Boris is a liar and it is time people can see his lie covered buses for what they were. A deliberate attempt to ruin a nation for his own precious ego and personal gain.
pro	Good Bye, Good Bye. We will say our last, GOOD BYE.
anti	Good Job Guys!!! now ¬£ = $
pro	Good Lord! It's not a German cartel, it's a Jewish cartel! The same Jewish banking/corporate cartel that has started all European wars for the last two hundred years. For God's sake wake up already!
anti	Good Lord! Just STOP BREXIT! It‚Äôs painfully obvious that it‚Äôs the right thing to do! Enough already! Why must a democratic, free thinking people hurl themselves over a cliff? Mature adults can see that a course needs to be changed, once circumstances change, and once data proves that it was not a good idea. They just say: ‚ÄúOn second thought, NO - based on what we know now, and where we are.‚Äù

pro	Good for the UK! Self-determination and Liberty is the highest value there is.
pro	Good for them. They will be free from the parasitic bankers that are sucking us all dry. I'm not a republican or a democrat but Trump could free us the same way. Even though I think he's a moron.

anti	Good job, UK. Because you couldn't get your shit straight, you've got your version of Trump back in office, and you're committing economic suicide.

Snouts in the taxpayer trough. They realise the lies at least, a bit late. ""Get out, repair the country"" ..... Fair enough. Leaving the EU will not solve the UKs demons which centre on class system and massive inequity. These people need to have a good look at Mogg Farage and Johnson. These people are rich and disingenuous, scum. I understand the disillusionment. Terrible."
pro	Good the European Union will collapse people will have freedom like britain
pro	"Good they leaving, this EU run by ""LGBT sunshines"" simply doesn't work. Long live to the UK"
pro	Good thing they left, now most of EU doesn't have to be influenced by the sharia law
anti	Good time to remind Brexiteers that before UK joined EU it was known as the sick man of Europe. The EU enriched the UK, not the opposite. Now watch the opposite occur. Can still stop it though!
pro	Good to escape from most corrupted EU.
pro	Good to hear it. Glory to God alone in Jesus most holy name. MAKE THE UK GREAT AGAIN!!! AMEN.
pro	Good to see Bruxelles sharpening their pencils. Time to cut Britain out of Europe.
pro	Good to see some of the younger generation took the time to even vote, Remain or Leave. I voted leave. I couldn't see anything more illogical than the EU unelected, self appointed committee members & presidents casting their personal opinion over the wills of the people. No matter what country you are from. It should always be down to the Sovereign Nation/People to decide what laws to pass & how to conduct themselves, their culture & way of life.
pro	Good trade deal with US will be good for the Enland we once knew
pro	Good, I hope they do leave the EU.
pro	Good, I wouldnt want to deal with immagrants either.
pro	Good, first step. Now go into the trade talks and do not for one moment let them dictate a thing to you. This country is behind you, you do not have to give an inch.
pro	Good, now get us out of the EU.
pro	Good, walk away, WTO article 42 trade with e u whilenegotiating a new one.
pro	Good, we must NEVER take their rules again and absolutely not allow their kangaroo court to impose their verdicts upon us again.
pro	Good. Best decision the country has made while I've been alive
pro	Good. Best decision the country has made while I've been alive.
pro	Good. Do not bow down to the EU. Their businesses need us and they also need our financial services. Tell them where to go.
pro	Good. EU has a lot of issues.
pro	Good. France should leave the EU as well.
pro	Good. Now just do a hard Brexit. The people have already had their say. It‚Äôs not for Eurocrats and politicians to overthrow that.
pro	Good. We are well out of this corrupt, undemocratic, German dominated club! As for Sturgeon, I'm Scottish and she doesn't speak for me.
pro	Goodbye EU back to the common market where it should of stayed
pro	Goodbye EU....and we don't mind closing the door behind us..
pro	Goodbye EU....and we don't mind closing the door behind us...

pro	Goodbye and good riddance to E.U establishment. Reform or die.
pro	Goodbye evil EU hello new better world
anti	Goodness knows why England gone down this path,,,how much hatred abounds in these dark satanic hills,,,personally I think it‚Äôs the Tories not actually understanding its citizens just its finance and London...yes the European workforce brought some growth to help England use its fertile land all one way though so citizens of Lincolnshire had no health finance,then complained,,,
anti	Gosh. A tax cut. How the brexit gullibles will cheer.
pro	Got #Brexit done! The UK FINALLY leaves the EU as Britons celebrate in jubilant scenes across the nation when clocks hit 11pm.
pro	Got my EU flag, ready to burn it on the 31st January.
anti	Got to love how the xenophobics voted for a break up of the EU, but are getting a breakup of the UK instead. LOL.
anti	Gove and Johnson look like they have just inherited a sick pet from a great aunt that have won a referendum...anyway, brexiters will be disappointed in 2 years time when they realise that we are still in the EU and Art. 50 never gets invoked....not a single PM will do that and risk going down in history as the PM that took the U out of the UK forever
pro	Governance by faceless bureaucrats, who are not representatives, will never end well.
anti	Great (Britain) looser. They lost Australia, India, Africa, US and Canada, lately Hong Kong and now all well wishers (Europe)!
pro	Great (patriotic) speech!! UK democracy has won the war!!
pro	Great Britain has been made great again! Congratulations
pro	Great Britain has the whole world to trade with.
anti	"Great Britain is heading where they've been heading for hundreds of years - down the drain. In the empire where the sun used to never set, they've hammered one of the final nails into their own coffin and the hole keeps getting deeper. Right-wing-nut philosophy is working really well isn't it? The problem is, most of the advocates of this ""me vs. the rest of the world"" philosophy are not intelligent enough to realize that all the trouble-makers now and in history have worked their magic with a perverted sense of the very same mindset."
pro	Great Britain is more than just a star on someone else's flag
anti	Great Britain is now Little Lonely Britain.
pro	Great Britain is very smart to Brexit !!!!
pro	Great Britain was a great country, before they joined the EU. They will be a great country when they leave. Sure, you'll have to disentangle yourselves, set up new trade agreements, but the benefits, are awesome. You'll govern yourself, austerity will end. No one will dictate to you, from a foreign country. A lot of Americans look up to you, for your bravery, and agree with you, for your ideals.
pro	Great Britain was once a great empire. Don't let the EU drag you down
pro	Great Britain we love you and now even more that great Britain will be independent country
pro	Great Britain will be great Britain again woooooooohoooooo
pro	Great Britain will do just GREAT now they are out.
anti	Great Britain will soon be no more, the fragmentation has already started and eventually lonely England will be assimilated as a new state of the USA.
anti	Great Britain, at 11pm tonight please remember to set your clocks back to 1972.
anti	Great Britain. You've thrown your one future into the trash pit. You left the union your entire economy growth is based on. Now the EU only has to make one single sanction against you and you're DESTROYED. But then again, I'll laugh at you when you'll run back to the EU in a few years and kneel down to them asking if they could rejoin.
pro	Great Britons are NOT Euro-Peons
pro	Great Job Boris!!! The world is rejecting the far left socialists.
pro	Great day for UK. Congratulations to make this decision. UK, now is free.
pro	Great day for our country to leave the eu ,but still be friends with the countries within the eu ,and one day others will leave take back control of your country .
pro	Great for the UK on leaving the globalist elite union! The Revolution is starting! Great job UK!
anti	"Great idea guys! How about we all come together and share resources and knowledge, have free and easy trade and travel between countries and the ability to live where we like and all without losing control of our own laws and borders and having a veto on any laws introduced by this organisation? Wait that's what we had? So why have we left? Oh yeh: ""brexit means brexit""... Well that's ok then.."
pro	Great idea. Hope the UK gets out. Why should they support several of the loser countries who are part of the EU?
pro	Great job Boris.
pro	"Great job Brits! Take your country back! If only us ""Yanks"" could take ours back too...."
pro	Great job UK. Globalism is a failed idea. The world is safe when all nations are strong prosperous and self dependent
pro	Great job, you Brits had the courage to do the right thing and won back your freedom. My hats off to you! Congratulations Well Done. I just hope my countryman vote for our freedom and elect Donald Trump.
pro	Great news! There will be some good some bad but the independence and self-determination is worth it!!!!
anti	Great news. Little England goes down the drain
pro	Great night had by patriots, keep the English flag flying high
pro	Great result. UK has sacrificed itself to allow the other european nations to use the leave excuse as blackmail to change things into the union. Thanks UK, your sacrifice will not be forgotten.
pro	Great stuff .we are out
anti	Great to know we would survive. Wasn't the purpose of brexit we would all be better off ? What happened to the sunny uplands ?
pro	Great to know you‚Äôre on our side Boris, keep strong.
pro	Great tweet DC. Remember all the furore around the millenuim bug!!! The planes still flew our computers didn‚Äôt stop and the country moved on. Let‚Äôs make this work it may be tough and we may have difficult times but let‚Äôs give it our very best shot!
anti	Great video! I do understand how they-UK feel about leaving but I believe the UK is going to suffer because of the exit.
pro	Great write up and every bit true. I am on holiday in Grand Canaria at the moment staying in a hotel with Germans french fin's Italians and Spanish all very friendly and they are asking about Brexit all who I have spoken to are very envious and think we will do extremely well.
anti	Great, not only will the tourist industry in Britain be hurt by Brexit, the entire British travel industry might perish because no one will dare to order any tickets .. well played.
anti	Great. I don't give a shit about hanging on to tenuious lines that cavemen drew out on a map. The idea we need to remain an independent country is naive and stupid.
pro	Greatest day in a long time. Globalists are being destroyed everywhere! Congratulations patriots!
pro	Greece¬†has become a case study of how the EU can destroy a country. It should be taught in universities. It is dreadful to see what is happening.
pro	Greeting from Finland! I believe in you UK, vote against continued inefficient rule of the incompetent bureaucrats in Brussels, vote leave! If your nation manages to leave this crony establishment, other countries like mine will have a better chance to do so as well. Good luck, and godspeed!
anti	Grievance politics swung the EU referendum to a leave vote. Now we are about to find out what a mistake that was.
pro	Grieve and the remainers want to drag it on until 2021 so that we have to participate in EU Elections, it brings in rafts of EU Legislation and allows for the EU to draft more! Most 'migrants' will have become EU citizens through residence rules allowing them EU passports and they STILL want freedom of travel! On yer bike! OUT, RIGHT OUT, NOW!
pro	Growing up without being surrounded by other cultures seems like heaven to me.
anti	Guardian front page should be ‚ÄúSmall island, small minds‚Äù.
anti	Gutted to speak with a friend today who's been working as a clinical psych in the UK for 18 years and is now leaving the UK because of brexit. That's now 9 of my colleagues in the last year. Our NHS cant afford to keep losing these amazing people.

pro	Haha so funny not... remainer moron you're a joke please move to a cucked EU country not many of those left while you can your globalist dream ( nightmare ) is over and you can't do anything to change that.
anti	Haha, gonna be fun to watch the island sink while the rats are clapping their own doom...
anti	Hahah that is hilarious. The UK must be about to discover some new industry that everyone is going to want and cannot replicate. The UK has been in steady decline for a long time, isolating itself through Brexit will just increase the pace of decline. They will be begging india for help soon. Hilarious..... oh the humiliation they will feel

anti	Hardcore Brexiteers crying in the comments because they don't like what they're hearing. Par for the course.
anti	Hardcore Brexiters will never be happy. They have Johnson in No 10, Trump in the White House, the UK is leaving the EU by law ... and they're still whining and complaining. Currently about a bell. They will never stop whining and complaining and playing the victim card. It's just who they are.
pro	"Has anybody else noticed that, although the BBC and others are happy to talk to both sides of Conservative MPs, the only Labour MPs they speak to are those who are in favour of staying in Europe (Yvette ""I will take in a migrant family but haven't got round to it yet"" Cooper being the lastest)? I don't believe for a second that all Labour MPs are in favour of remaining in yet that's the impression we are given. Their leader was in favour of withdrawal in 1975 yet tries to say that he wants to remain in yet his speech was hardly a ringing endorsement of continued membership - more ""I suppose that we better had"" rather than ""It's in our best interests to stay"". It's impossible to say where the economy will be next year, never mind in 14 years time so this is yet another scare story from the pro EU lobby. We have had two pro EU leaflets through our door so far - both have gone unto the recycling bin unread."
anti	Has anyone considered what the EU would be like if the UK became a proactive EU member instead of just moaning about cucumbers and immigrants? As the article points out the majority of immigrants are from outside the EU which is a bit inconvenient and cucumbers - Jesus. For me, the best things about the EU are freedom of movement, the near impossibility of major war and the security it brings by being part of 450m people. How can you put a price on that?
anti	Has anyone found the list of real benefits we are going to get from Brexit yet?
anti	Hasn't started yet. Wait until January 2021. Then it really goes down hill
anti	Hate me for this but we can't stop globalisation, isolation is not the way to go.
pro	Have a Great EX-EU free Day
anti	Have a friend who has worked in the Foreign Office for years and her reaction to how difficult trade deals were going to get should we leave were alarming. People don‚Äôt seem to have woken up to the skill drain that has left our shores since the vote took place. Over the past 40 years our negotiators have worked within the remits of the EU pact, most left after the vote as other countries headhunted them - many being EU nationals. Plus they were less than keen to lose the benefit of open travel. That, like the staff shortage in the NHS, means those who are expert in World Trade are few and difficult to find. Judging by the incredibly complex mess our politicians have made has only alienated those who the country needs to cast a better considered vote in a second referendum. Strange how discontent once fueled public action - but now mostly apathy.
pro	Have faith in God and He will make Brexit a success for the UK that's a clear message Britain should take a closer look :=).
anti	Have faith, there's time, We can still turn this around!
anti	Have not been on here for a while, but it is no surprise the usual Brexit extremists and anarchists still try to spread their anti EU rubbish. Then also those still completely ignorant of what a calamity they voted for, duped into voting leave by a clown who we now incredibly have as PM. The lunatics really are running asylum.
pro	Have said all along! No deal! Then, watch the EU come back to the table for a deal. Walk away WTO
anti	Have we hit the bottom yet?
pro	He does not understand why Britain is strong enough. We need no EU industry or Euros. The British people have paid so much money to build up atomic bombs, atomic subs, and good British atomic country. Some Brits have nothing to eat and must even starve because of our wonderful atomic British world we have built up and paid for. The EU industry and money and the Russian oligarchs have to go - leave our country - we need no EU or Russian oligarchs!! They destroy our Britain!
anti	He is going to make the UK poorer GDP growth 1,1 % When reality hits his failure will be a huge and this pipe dream about reigniting the British Empire fake dream
anti	He is not my Prime Minister. He is a charlatan.
anti	He replied that he had voted Leave at the Brexit referendum because he wants what‚Äôs best for England. For England. He voted Leave because of ENGLAND. Then ask me why I support Scottish independence.
pro	He should be concerned as pro-EU-religious zealots have handed the men of violence a perfect excuse not to follow the demorcratic process by constantly demonising those that voted leave and doing their best to ignore that vote. So democracy doesn‚Äôt work; why bother?
anti	"He should be given a medal for standing and telling the truth, unpleasant though it may be to those dumb enough to be following a ""Brexit"" route. VOTE IN IN IN !!!!"
pro	He was also very covertly #probrexit while being overwhelmingly polite. It's good to get out of London bubble sometimes
anti	Heart goes out to workers & families at Philips facing redundancy. Parliament failed you; I won‚Äôt give up on you.
anti	Heartbreaking to have to leave
anti	Heartbroken. The scientific community overwhelmingly opposed this. If sanity prevails, please let us come back, friends
pro	Hell yeah you can try to join us UK you were always our brother same with Canada
anti	Hello im a little bit late but one year passed and as a lot of Europeans i think you made a mistake. Stop being dominated by the old generation who voted for Brexit. Its 2019 get back here theres no point in leaving.
pro	Hello, I'm from the future. We voted to leave
anti	Hence rejoining is the best option. Maybe the intervening 20 odd years will ram that message home....
anti	Here is my 2020 to 2040 predictions; 1) Scotland will separate, regardless of what London wants. 2- Ireland will recover and do very well with EU trade. 3) Trump will lose and the new Admin will take a softer approach but the result is the same- parasitical capitalism enters the UK. The pound thinks its better off but will decrease in value. Leavers will enjoy learning how to clean their old and dying¬†,instead of the cheap labor,they deem to spit on.Also they will enjoy cleaning, washing dishes¬†, picking fruit all day long and so on. After 10 yrs of this shitt - they will give up and plead to rejoin the EU -who will reject their pleas!
anti	Here is what every country in the world is learning about brexit brittain. A completly self absorbed country unable to find common ground with anyone else or find solutions for common problems.
anti	Here we go.... the insane right wing no deal is where we are going. This will cause utter chaos and decline in the country. Then again this is the democratic will of the people.
anti	Here's an idea: if u can't deliver Brexit, don't do it!!!!
anti	Here's hoping Brexit becomes the biggest disaster in the history of the UK.
pro	Here's my list of the things I'll miss about being in the EU;......‚Ä¶..................
anti	Here's to bigots&haters who sold lies to the public destroying UK in the proces
pro	Heres to britain producing her own things again.
pro	Here‚Äôs a thought, why don‚Äôt all the remainers stop whining, and go live the EU paradise they adore and stop being so nasty and petty to the good democratic folk of the UK
anti	Here‚Äôs an idea, why doesn‚Äôt the UK try to shape Europe rather than trying to hide away from it?
pro	Hey Britain, the USA is here, ready and want to do business with our cousins. Everything you've relied on the EU for we have in abundance and we can do it better. Give US a chance.
pro	Hey the people already voted actually.
pro	Hey uk deserve the right to rule themselves.
anti	Hey! I have only one question. We are many here in Sweden who buy electronics, clothes, spare parts plus many many more things via the internet from the UK. Sweden plus many other European countries have cars, tractors, machines, kitchenware etc. made in England. Many of those internet companies may lose a lot of money. We outside of the UK do not find British manufactured items anymore at an exemplary price. We have built up a security to buy goods from the UK that we can not find outside of the UK. Do people in the UK know how many people have a business relationship with Europe over the internet?
anti	Hey, people. I am British and do NOT want to leave the EU. I am ashamed at some of the eurosceptic outpourings from politicians. I am proud to be European and thin it as astonishing achievement that we have al held together in the last 70 years. We‚Äôre not all bad !!!
pro	Hey, you must be a new kid around here, don‚Äôt you know thinking outside the Reddit hive isn‚Äôt cool? The mainstream media has told me that the EU are the good guys! No really, how does a ‚Äútrading bloc‚Äù turn into a ‚ÄúUnited States of Europe‚Äù with a military and no fucker is concerned. Full of tricks these folks.
pro	Hi, actually from the Uk, and voted to leave the EU.
anti	Hi, it is right that the UK leaves the EU while some of the UK politicians are unscrupulous enough to fool their own people with services like Cambridge Analytica. Hopefully the UK will not cut all kinds of standards (health, work, environment) to gain competitive advantage over the EU. That would only negatively affect the regular people. From the EU anthem: ‚ÄúIndeed, who even just has one soul to call his own in this world! And who never managed it should slink weeping from this union!‚Äù When the Cummings and Farages have no saying anymore, hopefully the UK will return. I strongly believe that is will be beneficial for the UK and the EU not just regarding trade. Greetings from Germany!
anti	Hilarious and beautiful trolling by the EU. Pay up, UK, and FO.
anti	Hilarious how many dumbski leavers are going to be crying over time when they realise they've been duped by a bunch of Tory conmen who are only in it for themselves and the top 1% wealthy. You are telling me you can look at the above catalogue of Tory MPs and say that you trust these oligarchical pawns with your life? Unbelievable.
anti	Hilarious stuff... and now all the leave voters are blaming politicians for this mess. This is the result of giving democracy to a bunch a people who have absolutely no clue about what they‚Äôre voting for. What a mess.
anti	Hilarious. Europe say it will take years if we leave as do the yanks, but still brexiters continue to believe the uk will be fine. Tell me exactly who are we going to trade with??
anti	Hilarious. Nigel should go to university and learn some rational thinking to replace the crap and lies presented here. It would appear that he has been milking Europe for years through your MEP salary and so called extra MEP perks. Both of his wives were non British. What a hypocrite. Cheers!
anti	Hindsight from 2019 :D I have never seen a bigger shitfest than Brexit and I have seen 2 girls one cup :).
pro	Hip hip hooray for Britain!!
anti	His grasp of the facts is beyond doubt however. Not that mastery of the English language tends to be much of a Brexiteer trait anyhow, having said that.
pro	"Historically, this country has always done well by avoiding foreign entanglements. Brexit can only be for the good. Also historically, our foreign policy was based on ""balance of power"" in Europe. We ensured no-one got too big. One has to wonder if our government-in-residence (the civil service) hasn't been still following this policy: our leaving now, with the EU at its weakest, will ensure that member countries will be at each others' throats over the budget shortfall. The suggestion being true or not is irrelevant: this is a mortal blow for the EU - Nemesis in action - and even if the EU survives, it won't prosper. Without the UK, it simply doesn't generate enough to keep itself afloat: the Germans, rigorous as they are, can't do it all alone."
anti	"History exams in 2050: ""Whose fault was Brexit?"
pro	History remembers a time when the UK was a nation of explorers. Now it seems we're consumers of the crumbs from EU's table. #brexit #leave
anti	History tells us that new eras generally follow disasters . The disaster hasn't happened yet
anti	History will find the old men in the Conservative Party who have planned and plotted this day with an obsession bordering on delusion responsible for a very large step down in the history of our nation. Our economic health, our civic life, the life chances of young people and our status on the world scene will be diminished. A shameful episode.
anti	History will judge it harshly
anti	History will not be kind to your legacy. The rest of the world already sees you - and now the UK - as a pitiable joke.
anti	History will record Cameron's submission of Brexit to the popular vote as the dumbest decision by any British PM since Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler by handing over Czechoslovakia.
pro	History will show Brexit was best thing we could ever have done. Nationalism is good, it works. Nationalism is on the rise across all of Europe. France, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Netherlands... The people of Europe never asked for a United States of Europe. Overwhelmingly they don't want it, nor will they let it happen either. Britain was the first to leave the EU. But we won't be the last ;)
pro	History won't remember this evening as the moment the UK regained its independence. It will be the moment when the self-righteous establishments dream of an authoritarian EU died.
anti	Hm, the show will only begin now, when the Scots and (Northern) Irish will be dragged out of the EU against their own will... duck, duck, go!
anti	Hmm what a childish nationalist mess this country is in. Fuck me the U.K. is just turning into one big steaming pile of a nationalist shithole before our very eyes.
anti	Hmmm, given that Brexit is going to be a disaster whatever happens, No Deal is beginning to sound quite attractive if it makes the bastard Tories pay for their stupidity. Make them unelectable until the late 2030s.
anti	Hmmm... Almost as if brexit will be terrible for business... Hmmm...
pro	Ho ho ho. Your liberal paradise of globalism and cultual Marxism is coming to an end.
pro	Hogwash. The UK is one of the USA largest exporters, and only 3 or 4 of the other EU countries are comparible. Scaremongering and lies. I'm not falling for it. That's why I'm voting OUT.
anti	Hold another referendum but this time do it properly and include everyone who has a stake in the outcome
anti	Hold lying Boris to account for all the Brexit lies!
pro	Holy Crap! PragerU got Nigel Farage! My God this guy is a savage, a true British hero!
anti	Honest question from a remainer here. How do you imagine your life improving after Brexit takes place? Genuinely asking what effect you think it will have on your day to day life.
anti	Honestly even though I don‚Äôt the UK being made fun of, I can see why people would. This situation is pretty wack.
anti	Honestly it seems like the Russians got exactly what they wanted. The UK has spent years only focusing on this one stupid issue. And it literally might end the UK entirely with Scotland and Wales and NI wanting to stay in the EU. To me I just think at some point, the Prime Minister should just say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and throw the whole idea out. Call it quits and just stay in the EU.
pro	Honestly this is the EU's fault for treating the UK like second-class citizens when they were clearly one of the most wealthy countries in the agreement, the EU relied on the UK significantly, yet Brussels made all of the decisions about policy in the UK.
anti	Honestly, I really don't think brexit will solve any of the problems the UK faces. We will still have a useless government, non EU immigration policy will remain the same, the forgotten corners of the UK will remain ignored by the UK
pro	Honestly, I thought these people were team British. All these remainers should stop talking the country down!
anti	Honestly, how there ever was a referendum without clear exit plan is utterly befuddling
pro	Hoorah for leaving the economic turmoil that is the European Union!
pro	Hooray for Britain! Hooray for Brexit! Hooray for freedom!
pro	Hooray my area voted leave. I can be proud of my area for more than just the virtue of being my area.
pro	Hope all countries break away from eu. It's nice to travel abroad but not to be dictated by the dictators, there is only one solution, to become AUTONOMOUS
pro	Hope it works out for the UK. Don't get why all the other people from the EU here are so bitter. Best of luck to you guys!
pro	Hope with all my heart that OUT wins, that so many millions of us really truly want and believe in.
anti	Hope you like paying for more expensive food!
anti	Hopefully Brexit will be postponed for a couple of months, to when the weather will be a bit more warmer to sleep on the streets after we have lost our jobs and homes.
pro	Hopefully Brexit will happen soon.
pro	Hopefully more countries will follow.
pro	Hopefully more will leave, after the UK exit.
pro	Hopefully other European countries will brexit too let those fascists fall
pro	Hopefully we leave with no deal.
pro	Hopefully we leave. I don't want to get effected by article 13.
anti	Hopefully, when the license fee is stopped, they can blame that on brexit as well.
anti	Hopefully, with how long it took to get brexit started, the country had enough time to stock food and medicine.
pro	Hoping the EU sticks to its position so we can exit with No Deal.
anti	How I feel? I watched Boris Johnson (whom I don't consider to be a prime minister of anything)..and looking at that idiot and listening to his nonsence made me realize that I have to make it out of the UK before the end of this year...being in the mercy of these kind of people is frankly frightening!
pro	How I smile everyday knowing that Leave won, and the fact Remaoners just can't except democracy...
anti	"How about ""Lieing Brexit Bastards, funded by crooked millionaires, supported by old bigots""? How can a democracy remain democratic when it is subverted and traduced by creatures like Cummings and Aaron Banks, and the propaganda trolls of Tufton Street....all Brexit Mongers talking of war.? Liar! Liar!"
pro	How about Plan A, which was to leave and what the country voted for?
anti	How about all the jobs that will be next to impossible if we lose freedom of movement?
anti	How about if we don't leave at all. That seems to be the best option all round to be fair.
anti	How about no brexit at all
pro	How about plan L. We just Leave
pro	How about we pay nothing and the eu takes its illegal migrents back.
pro	How about you leave the British people to decide. The sooner we exit the corrupt quango that is the EU the better.
pro	How anyone could be opposed to national sovereignty I really don't know.
anti	How anyone ever believed that the UK could afford to radically reduce its clout with Europe, or worse yet believed that leaving the EU would mean MORE clout. The whole thing is based on lies. Someone posted about Remainer distortions of Norway's relationship with the EU. Okay... sure... but none of this would have ever happened were it not for the central lie the vote was based on... that the UK would materially benefit from leaving. It was never true, and nothing will make it true.
anti	How anyone still sticks up for Brexit is baffling.
pro	How are people for an undemocratic superstate?
anti	How bad will austerity get under a No Deal Brexit? Well, in 100 years time they'll be making musicals about it.
pro	How britain lost europe. ..haha...what a brainless title...britain chucked the EU.... Merkel kick started the whole thing. By inviting 1.5 million Muslims to come to make their way to Germany ...Europe is still suffering repurcussions of it now. ..with rises in the right all across Europe ...
anti	How can BoJo expect to strike the best ever deal with EU if he continuously criticises the EU 27? He's incredibly childish and a shame to UK.
anti	How can Brexiteers deny the reputation they have gathered since Brexit campaign started, when they celebrate entering in the transition period, where the UK becomes a rule taker rather than a rule maker, as leaving the EU?
anti	How can Britain fix Brexit? Simple cancel it if it has any common sense left (which at this point looks very doubtful that it has).
pro	How can anyone STILL be in favour of the EU.
anti	How can anyone support political and economical suicide? Stop Brexshit now!
anti	How can you celebrate it ???What‚Äôs this ???New Year‚Äôs Eve ??Sick .The united is the key .Think WAR and you change your mind when is too late .
pro	How can you constructively give an answer to a situation or prediction about the future when it hasn't happened yet i really hope and think Britain will prosper from the dictatorship from unelected Brussel leaders whos interests are their first priority
anti	How can you vote for Brexit, you idiots?
anti	How childish and moronic. This entitled group of narcisists have been paid handsomely in an expectation that they are capable of respect for the institution and display adult behaviour and the competence required . I however have the greatest respect for the European Parliament and will continue to do so.
pro	How come all i'm hearing about in the news is #Brexit? I thought @BorisJohnson promised to GET BREXIT DONE on 31st January. Why are they still going on about it now? The British people voted to get it done... Why isn't it done yet?!! #LeaveMeansLeave #Brexshit
pro	How come all the immigrants are given social housing while we can't get it? and we have to rent private which is expensive. vote leave.
anti	How could a modern, educated and open society have got it so wrong
anti	How dare Farage use Ireland to back up his idiotic notions? How dare he twist my vote in both Lisbon Treaty referendums and why I changed my mind? Am glad Mairead McGuinness cut his diatribe off. Thank goodness he is off to the States. Europe has had enough of his gracelessness, tactlessness and rudeness.
anti	How dare these Europeans have competent politicians?
anti	How did it happen that UK decided to leave EU without any plan? It takes years of preparations law adjustments even changes in construction to join the Union. Why anyone thought it would be easy to just leave it? Where is the plan B or C? I don't think the EU is flawless but if you want to leave you have to be fully prepared for all outcomes and have full support of the nation. There are many countries that 'want' (lately have new and/or more conservative parties more popular) to leave but after the brexit mess I don't think they will do it
pro	How did we ever manage to elect a Parliament full of people that cannot even understand the meaning of simple English words... LEAVE IS LEAVE.
pro	How did we tie the knot to be in the EU in the first place? I am not a psychic but I forseen that this marriage won't work 15 years ago. It's better to quit and get divorced. We can do a lot more and better than being controlled by the EU community. One thing Britain must do, is to re-gain her legacy and stop selling off our assets or privatisation of major/manufacturing industries. We must safeguard and regenerate our British values and heritage.
anti	How do I feel?.....Tired, elated, full of dread, and sick to the back teeth of the dreaded B word.....
pro	How does freedom feel my British friends üá∫üá∏üá¨üáß
pro	How hard is it to walk away from a deal........just tell the EU your done....
anti	How is it possible to be team Brexit?
anti	How is leaving one of the biggest markets in the world good for the UK?
pro	How is leaving the EU a Bad thing?
anti	How is splitting apart into inconsequential, bound to be vassal states better than actually trying to work things out?
anti	How leaving can be anything other than disaster
anti	How long before Russia makes a move on the remainder of continental Europe? It‚Äôs packaged for the taking now that Britain is out
anti	How long before the next generation seek the vote to return. Will Farage get an EU pension? Finally one Union Jack for sale on ebay
anti	How long until @BorisJohnson 's handlers realise that the fight isn't over just because they want it to be? #StopBrexit #RejoinEU
anti	How long will it be before the little England folks flood the channel tunnel?
anti	How low Britain has fallen - what a mess it is
anti	How mad we are to think Brexit would be positive! No gain....we should remain!
pro	How many banks put family's on the street.we did not vote for brexit we voted LEAVE. she works for a bank that has up sticks and run ,You can bet you're life watch that same bank come crawling back when this country does better outside of the E.U.
anti	How many companies have to pull out of UK/ stop investment/ close down before they accept that economic decline is the price for their xenophobic Disneyland?
pro	How many more years do you give the EU surviving? The EU is just Hitler's New order. Pure EVIL. Where I lived in Oxford, every German family had EU stickers on their windows. If I put a vote leave sticker on mine, I would have no windows. The EU is brown shirt madness.
anti	How many people who voted for Brexit still think it's a good idea?
pro	How many votes do they bloody want, oh yes as many as it takes until they win, PLEASE SAVE US ALL THIS GRIEVANCE AND FECKING MOVE TO YOUR BELOVED EU, we will help you pack and have a party when you are gone please take the SNP AND NICOLARSE WITH YOU
pro	How much Salt, can the remainers and the EU produce?
anti	How much did the economy grow in the UK since they filed for Brexit?
pro	How much longer do we have to put up with all this rubbish ? Get us out now.
anti	How much more *evidence* do we need before we accept that #Brexit is a right-wing ideology that'll only benefit the very rich? Its promises are a fantasy that can't be delivered. The damage will be huge & largely irreversible!
pro	How on earth can anyone want to remain in the EU after listening to Tim Martin.
pro	How on earth could one have even considered staying in the #EU? It was rapidly on the way towards being the western equivalent of the #USSR -semi-autonomous member countries -ruled autocratically from a central location -by politicians with fealty only to the politburo
anti	How soon before Scotland and Northern Ireland separate from the UK
anti	How stupid Brexit is
pro	How to make your nation FREE!?... STEP ONE : Lead the Example of the Brexit!!
anti	How was UK economy before joining EU or preEU in 70s? Trade deals, laws, and much more have shaped the UK to be 5th largest economy and EU contributed a lot into that in many ways.
anti	How will closing Britain off be more prosperous economically?
anti	How would independent trade agreements be more advantegous than those Brussels secures?
anti	How would you feel if brexshit happened and you woke up, on 30th March, and was expected to celebrate because it's your birthday Think I'm going to be very angry that day.
pro	How you feeling this morning bedwetters, all your moaning, back stabbing and treachery has solved nothing only push the UK closer to a no deal Brexit. Poor Remainers must be getting a taste for losing.
anti	How's Brexit going to help them? If anything it's going to make them poorer.
anti	How? The reality is that British people will lose a lot of freedoms.
pro	However if Britain is leaving the EU it is also not able to participate in the process¬†of creating a more democratic EU. The EU is not perfect and needs to be adapted to be more efficient and democratic. However by abandoning it, you leave the decision to the other countries and watch from the outside.
anti	However, we don't get services access to the EU unless they say so.
anti	Huge mistake IMO. Also, the fact that all it took was a simple majority to make such a drastic decision like that was another mistake on the UK government's part. A vote like that should require a 3/5ths majority imo.
anti	Huge unemployment down the road, alot of companies leaving auld blighty. Alot of money leaving the economy. Business with America will not go well either.
anti	Hugely disappointed that the UK has followed through with Brexit on Friday.
pro	Huh.. the United Kingdom is still there... I was told it would evaporate on leaving the EU‚Ä¶
pro	Humanity wins when tyrannical globalists lose.
anti	Humans work together best by building broad bridges not retreating behind shallow borders.
pro	Hungry, poor, greedy, corrupted EU keep saying ‚ÄúMy precious üá¨üáß‚Äù can‚Äôt let you go
anti	I 100% am voting to stay. All the expects from multiple fields think this is the right opinion, with intelligent qualified people saying leave being the exception rather than the norm. Leaving will make travelling (something I love) more difficult/expensive and could have major negative economic effects for years to come. I really hope the country makes the right choice when we vote and lots of people do actually vote. There is such a terrible attitude amongst people (particularly young people) that it's not worth voting, which is really harmful.
anti	I HATE YOU BREXIT I DONT CARE IM GOING MOVING LITHUANIA üá±üáπ GOODBYE NORTHERN IRELAND
anti	I Hope Brexit can be avoided. The younger generation that will need to cope with these problems for decades to come. The British people don‚Äôt deserve this kind of punishment.
pro	"I Know what I voted for in 4 words ""Liberty, Freedom and Democracy"" aka BREXIT. What did you vote for?"
pro	I Know what NO DEAL mean for me, being out of EU, that is exactly what i voted for, TO BE OUT OUT OUT OUT, i did not vote for any deal
pro	I Know what NO DEAL mean for me, being out of EU, that is exactly what i voted for, TO BE OUT OUT OUT OUT, i did not vote for any deal.
pro	I SO can't wait until we're free from the shackles of EU rights and protections and are completely under the control of an unrestrained deranged Tory Gov who don't care that our stockpiled 'optimism' doesn't ACTUALLY feed our kids. It'll be fucking great. #JustBelieve #Brexit
pro	I SUPPORT YOU LOVING YOUR COUNTRY! I can only hope for a better path for the States - be nice to not send all my money to china and mexico manufacturing, and taking care of 10 million plus illegals from all countries with my tax dollars. I want more in my paycheck - but I'm a hater to support a border for my country - bringing back the jobs. The nuts are in the jar - but the more we keep out the better - and that begins at our borders and airports. Britain is now again an island, I think Churchill would like that, you set forward a tsunami of change in the world. A royal flushing, and the world needed that - and the people spoke - as they will in November in America - the silent majority want change too.
pro	I Support Brexit and still do.
anti	I VOTED TO REMAIN AND NO ONE IS LISTENING TO MEEE
anti	I absolutely agree with this piece; it articulates pretty much everything that motivated me to vote Remain and my current fears for our country. The lack of leadership both nationally and on the wider international stage is very worrying and I don't see anyone with the skills or vision to tackle the serious problems we face. Here in the Disunited Kingdom, we are lurching to the right and, as the piece says, hard-won freedoms are under threat. It's very depressing.
anti	I absolutely despite Brexit; many of the people who voted to leave did so out of xenophobia, and the whole negotiation process has been a mess. Brexit has made me feel ashamed of my country.
anti	I actually agree with you, which is why I voted remain. I don't think protectionism (be it in labour or markets) has any real positives for society as a whole.
pro	I actually feel a touch sorry for the eu commission. They see their influence drifting away. They try to have greater influence by making even more stupid demands, but it's too late. We've gone. Bad luck guys.
pro	I advise British people stop panic and realize that life is still continue even without EU . Look at USA , Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea these countries is not in EU and they have a great economy . And finally i wish UK put their trust in God and Savior Jesus Christ.
pro	I advocate leaving the EU, however my fear is simple. If the remain camp win this country will be nothing but a second class member of the EU super state, no longer self governing but controlled entirely from Brussels, Strasburg but mainly Berlin. The UK will have no say in the way the EU is run or funded, it will be the laughing stock of Europe. This country must I hope Vote to leave on the 23rd June.
anti	I agree BillC. Use your head, vote Remain.
anti	I agree and still my main reason for supporting remain is that they have enhanced our environmental and employment practices. Many Brexiters actively campaigned on removing these regulations and I don't trust those who brush those points aside.
pro	I agree the Commonwealth of Nations will save the UK's economy
anti	I agree there are plenty of things wrong with the EU, but most of them have little effect on our daily lives
pro	I agree with Boris, there's no need to be too close to the EU. We should have never be so close with them in the first place. Good that we're out.
anti	I agree with Macron, this is a lose lose, but a huge ammount is going to depend on whether the current both hard and yet utterly unclear line that Johnson is taking is the act or the reality of his actual ambitions...
pro	I agree with Mr Davis ,but if the Government truely repects the will of the 17.4 million they can follow Mr Moggs advice and close parliment which will put an end too the remoaners dirty tricks
anti	I agree with the majority here. It wasn't just like shooting yourself in the foot, it was taking aim at it beforehand. What still baffles me the most to this day is why Teresa May triggered article 50 when she did. Any kind of leverage was lost in that moment because she set the timer for the self-destruction mechanism.
pro	I agree with the video, but even if Brexit was to make me poorer, personally I still would have voted to leave.
pro	"I agree with this and its one of the core reasons I want out. In my opinion the issue with immigration isn't the numbers, its the type of people. We should apply the same standards to european migrants that we do to non eu migrants and allow people in who prove they will give back. Its a disgrace we turn away hard working skilled workers from outside the EU while allowing any european in. Just look at the comments from people like George Osborne to see how out of touch the remain campaigners are with immigration. His solution to curbing immigration is to tighten restrictions on non eu immigration- he wants to turn away more skilled immigrants to allow more potentially non skilled immigration. Who benefits from this because it isn't fairer for immigrants and it isn't better for the UK. On an unrelated point, I think we should leave because the EU is unreformable (at least without a sudden direction change). Cameron gave it his best shot to get reforms and what they offered was a joke. ""Change or we'll leave"" is the strongest position we can negotiate from inside the EU and Cameron got nothing. All the remainers saying we'll reform the EU from inside fail to explain how we are going to trigger this change. What leverage are we suddenly going to get that will make the eu rethink its position? All staying in will do is tell the EU that the british people are happy and it will look like a green light to carry on. Whether we wish to leave for good or simply negotiate a new EU like relationship with Europe we have a better chance doing it from a position of power outside of the EU. Staying in is not a vote to keep things the same and its not a risk free vote. The eu has changed drastically since the creation of the common market and its only going in one direction, it is taking sovereignty and binding countries together. If we stay in the eu who knows what state it will be in in 5, 10 or 15 years time. If we vote stay then decide to leave in 10 years all the economic concerns could be a lot worse, at this point we really should decide whether we are in it to the end or we should get out now. There is no shame in leaving, abandoning a sinking ship isn't quitting, its common sense."
anti	I agree, the UK politicians have been hugely damaging the UK. Luckily, being in the EU, only few noticed. As soon as the UK is out, all kind of problems that¬†so¬†far have been hidden will explode to everyone‚Äôs face‚Ä¶
pro	I agree, there is still plenty to do but we at last heading in the direction the majority wanted..
pro	I agree, we voted leave, SO, leave. The EU will come running when they realise what they stand to lose. We can buy direct from countries around the world. Leave the EU to swim in it‚Äôs own problems and leave us alone
pro	I allways thought handing over control of a country to a foreign power is treason...
pro	I also voted in 1975 to remain in a 'Common Market' not in the European Union which didn't exist at the time. We were conned by Heath and the establishment and a terrible wrong has been righted.
anti	I always find it cynical of brexiteers who say they only wanted to be part of a common market. They are effectively saying they don't share the ideals of the EU, which was all about peace. They have an exploitative attitude but can't see the ugliness of it.
anti	I always thought that adults know what they are doing. Now as im growing older i notice everyone is actualy just clueless
pro	I am 100% behind you Boris. Keep going as our PM!
pro	I am 100% for Brexit and I‚Äôm American
anti	I am 17 years old, I am a student and currently study politics. Last night a decision was made which will have a direct impact on my future. The decision to leave the EU was made without my voice being heard. I couldn‚Äôt vote in what is probably the most important political decision the British people have made, an irreversible decision. I have followed these campaigns, I am capable of making an informed and rational choice ‚Äì the fact that I wasn‚Äôt able to, that many other informed and passionate 16/17-year-olds were not able to, seems to me incredibly undemocratic. My future is completely changed; I will not have the benefits my parents and their generation have had, such as freedom of movement between all EU countries. Mostly I am outraged that this decision, which reflects on the British people, has been made without my consent. The future already looks less bright for us and it is a future I did not have a say in shaping.
pro	I am 23 and I support Brexit
pro	I am American & I support Brexit, but I hate all Brexit supporters except myself for being antiCommunist antiMarxist nationalist hypocrites who only want to replace one form of collectivist oppression with another: nationalism (and christianity).
anti	I am British and I'm relocating to a European Union country before I'm caught up in this shambles.
pro	I am British and proud of it. The referendum was the first opportunity in my lifetime to have my say
pro	I am English first, British second, And European as a distant third
anti	I am European. Since 1993, as EU members, Britons have been able to live and work anywhere within the member states. This allowed me to live and work both in France and Italy and identify as European. Will future generations do and feel the same?
anti	I am LibDem voter who wants to #StopBrexit
pro	I am SO HAPPY that we are leaving. Against all odds we won our Democratic Vote. Next sort out the Civil Service to abide by Democratic Votes they tried everything to get us to remain. Don‚Äôt ever underestimate the British. THANK YOU NIGEL FARAGE I respect you and will never forget you. Get your knighthood and fight for our rights in The Lords we will need you there as you aren‚Äôt an MP which you should be
pro	I am SO PROUD and SO HAPPY for the British people. They have gone through dark times before, but they always fight their way back.
anti	I am STILL and ALWAYS WLL BE - European
pro	I am a 20 year old who couldn't vote since I was a few months off. I would have voted leave and probably would still do that
anti	I am a 24-year-old British-Asian woman from London. I voted remain. I am so deeply saddened by the results I watched come in through the night. It seems I‚Äôve been experiencing the run-up to the election in some sort of bubble on my Facebook page, where it is filled by the people who have similar political leanings. This is what makes it even more shocking. In the past three weeks I have experienced harassment (physical and verbal) on public transport. Two out of the three have included racial slurs. It is hard to disassociate that from the rhetoric of the leave campaign, which seems to have given a voice to ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù racists and xenophobes. It can‚Äôt be a coincidence that several of my friends have experienced a similar thing. I have lived in this country all my life and for the first time feel very ashamed to be British. I am angry that the older generation have selfishly voted for a future that I will have to live with. Young people did not vote for this. I am angry that I have to wake up to Nigel Farage‚Äôs smug face claiming that the NHS figures that have been touted were a lie. I am angry that my European friends, as well as my non-white British friends and family members have woken up to a less safe, more divided country.
pro	I am a passionate, pragmatic, and positive believer in Brexit, and with my three-step plan, we can decisively leave the E.U.
pro	I am a professional myself with board positions in several international companies. I also voted leave.
pro	I am a socialist and believe in democracy, and my main sticking point was the secret TTIP discussions and I was fearful for our NHS. I am an EU national as well as a British citizen, and I also didn‚Äôt like the lies from the remain camp telling us that our workers‚Äô rights exist only because of the EU. Trade unions fought for our rights as they have always done. We need to hold our politicians accountable and vote them out if necessary. We can now choose how we spend our own nation‚Äôs money and not be given our pocket money like children. We can decide who we trade with. We shall decide the terms of that trade by negotiation. We shall set our own agenda. We shall be able to keep our public services and not be forced to privatise them, and if we choose we can re-nationalise our industries which would not be allowed in the EU. I didn‚Äôt like the way remain were continuously trying to imply that anyone who didn‚Äôt agree with them must fit the media‚Äôs narrative that a leave voter is a rightwing bigot. I believe in every country determining its own fate and I have always supported nations claiming independence for its own people. Why are we considered bigots or racists for wanting to make our own decisions for our own country? Whatever the long-term outcome for our country, I believe in freedom and self-determination. I hope we can get over the divisions and work together to find our identity once again. What kind of a nation we want to become will be decided by us, and we shall succeed or fail by our own efforts as a nation together. I have been truly shocked and saddened by the vitriol spewing from members of the remain camp, especially the younger voters who have even suggested that the right to vote should be withdrawn from older people who disagree with them. What great advocates for democracy!
pro	I am a supporter of democracy so would be hypocritical if I didn't support Brexit.
anti	I am actually scared about the referendum result. Too many people will vote out purely based on immigration and it's quite sad. #VoteRemain
pro	I am afraid it is not that simple.¬† For many Remainers, it is axiomatic that Brexit will be a disaster.¬† They are not 80% sure it will be a disaster, or 90% sure, but 100% sure.¬† Such Remainers will be talking Britain down for years into the future.¬† Now they may be right - personally, I am 80% sure Britain will be better off with Brexit, on a five-year time frame.¬† What I believe will happen is that the EU will start crashing in the next 1 to 10 years.¬† The next recession might do it, or it might be the changing dynamic, now that France and Germany are lead nations.¬† I suspect that the French now recognize that expansion eastwards was a mistake - I would say probably a fatal mistake - but holding up Albania and Northern Macedonia's entry is too little too late.¬† But it is only when Europe crashes that Remainers might accept that the UK got it right - and even then, perfidious Albion is likely to be blamed for undermining the wonderful experiment.
anti	I am afraid that a lot of Brexiters KNEW they were lied to but they did not care because most were blinded by xenophobia. They are what is known as SINGLE ISSUE voted where any damage is acceptable as long as their xenophobia is addressed.
anti	I am against brexit, if things goes south we can always move to another EU country.?
anti	I am against the British exit.If Britain exits the EU,the Federalists will have more power as Britain is the biggest and most powerful nation opposing Federalism in the EU.
anti	I am against. I travel a lot and freedom of movement is far too important to me to scrap. I'm expecting to do some work in Frankfurt, Warsaw and Milan over the next year and I'd much rather do it without all the red tape. It's one of the best things about the EU but not enough Brits take advantage of it. I think if we learned foreign languages from primary school upwards, more people would be thrilled about heading to Germany, France, Spain, Italy, etc. for work.
pro	I am an ardent leaver who is so glad Brexit is done, but I am also an ardent believer in the union and cannot contemplate it being broken up by xenophobic claptrap. I am a proud yorkshireman but England did,nt make us great by ourselves, we became this great nation because we are a union, we will continue to be a great nation as we move out into the world again because we are a union.
pro	I am an east African living in Sweden and endorse Brexit for many reasons.
pro	I am an unabashed Anglophile and I see this as a great day for all of you. Europe was holding you back.
pro	I am and always will be an English man and a citizen of Great Britain and jolly proud of it. I am not a European they are a different race than me.
anti	I am ashamed of the 'insularness' of my fellow Brits. The future for mankind is for nations to draw closer together in harmony NOT to split apart.
anti	I am ashamed of the 52% who voted to take us out.
anti	I am astounded by the stupidity of the British politicians. About to drive their country off a cliff but people still trust them because JRM has a posh accent?
pro	I am attached to a strict approach to Brexit: I respect the British vote, but the worst thing would be a sort of weak E.U. vis-a-vis the British.
pro	I am beginning to to think that people do not think like me or you? Or simply do not care? Maybe we are the crazy ones for wanting a safer better country.
pro	I am clearly raising a few pints of Irish and English beer tonight!!! Congratulations Great Britain . Now you can work on becoming ‚Äúgreat again ‚Äú !!!!! Cheers !!!!
anti	I am completely lost by the British style of negotiations. At first I suspected that the lousy results were due to the intellectual low qualities of the British bunch of idiots d' village marshalling the Brexit but maybe its in line with the glorious history of British diplomacy which outcomes appears only on the very last day of the negotiations.
anti	I am deeply disappointed because Politico published this article. And this is not due to the fact I am pro-EU. This is because the this article is highly biased and reckless.
anti	I am devastated that we are leaving the EU shame on all of you that voted leave
anti	I am disgusted at how the British MEP‚Äôs behaved, the other countries expressed sorrow but also how much the British have done for the Europe and then sang ol Lang syne, while our MEP‚Äôs made it all about them and the British, flaunting laws and basically saying good riddance... they should have shown respect not nationalist guff. A very sad day.
pro	I am english, you are European.. We are not the same
anti	I am fed up with Brexiteers in denial about the political chaos and economic damage that they inflicted on the UK, with the help of Catastrophe Cameron. The politicians are laughing at you. 37.5% of the electorate voted to make us all poorer. That's what you wanted and that's what they'll give you. They don't care, it won't affect them. They‚Äôll still have their jobs long after you have lost yours.
pro	I am from Austria, I am happy about brexit.
pro	I am from Dublin Ireland and I think we should leave the EU well done Uk
anti	I am from Romania and I met an amazing british guy in a hotel that decided to visit every single country in the EU because he feared missing this opportunity due to the stupid brexit
anti	I am from wales and i think it was a terrible idea to leave the EU
pro	I am glad, Europe is a great idea on paper but not working.
anti	I am growing suspicious of Brexit. They are separating from EU and creating more integrated ties with the US..This might prove to be a mistake.. The NIH might become subject to Big Pharma and the health insurers desire to privatize through subversion
anti	I am growing suspicious of Brexit. They are separating from EU and creating more integrated ties with the US..This might prove to be a mistake.. The NIH might become subject to Big Pharma and the health insurers desire to privatize through subversion.. Someone please dissuade me of these thoughts.
pro	I am happy for you, you have finally managed to drop the chains of the EU. I only wish you the best for the future. Down with the EU dictatorship.
pro	I am having my own bank holiday on 23rd of June. !
pro	I am having optimistic beliefs that we will leave on the 31st.
anti	I am impressed how the EU has remained united and how it has negoiated. There two ways forward either we take the best route which is to stop Brexit or she drops her stupid red lines. At the moment she is trying for something that will not work. We need strong leaders who put the country first and provide us a way out of this disaster. The WTO approach makes no sense at all
pro	I am in the U.S. and the media here is saying that if there is a hard Brexit, there will be food shortages, and the housing market will crash. I'm not sure why they are pushing this false narrative.
anti	I am incredibly sorry to see the UK leave. I think it is a huge, idiotic mistake that will benefit no one.
pro	I am not a radical simply because I support my nation- I am not a bigot because I believe in British jobs for British workers- I am not a racist just because I think British people should be put first- I am not intolerant just because I want our borders closed to protect our culture and identity- I should not be classified as extream because I want extremists deported- & most important of all I should not have to explain myself in my own country.
anti	I am not being defeatist. I know referenda are very dangerous ways of deciding the fate of a nation - see what happened on 23 June 2016. Can you guarantee Remain will win this time? ¬†As a staunch remainer, I hope it will - but I am not at all sure.
pro	I am not british but european....get out of EU !! We support you and will probably follow soon!!
pro	I am now absolutely certain that the UK must leave as soon as possible.
anti	I am now absolutely terrified that my family is going to split up. My wife is Danish and she may be forced to leave us, perhaps taking our 1 year old son away :(
pro	"I am old enough to remember joining the EU...we joined.. we didn't ""crash in"" so why are we ""crashing out"" we are leaving. Language is so emotive ..."
pro	I am old enough to remember the UK BEFORE we joined the EU. I for one couldn't be happier to be out of it! Now we can get back to some common sense, making our own laws once again, and looking after our own affairs, instead of being dictated to, and having our wealth squandered on European projects!
pro	I am proud of Britain. We Americans should Leave the UN and end all treaties with Mexico and other nations that are not in our best interests. We should do more trade directly with Great Britain and any other nations that leave these shitty one world government movements.
anti	I am ready to campaign with all my heart and soul to keep Britain inside a reformed European Union
anti	I am sick and tired of Brexit. It's a bad idea that hasn't gotten any better with the passage of time and vast amounts of resource. End it with membership of the single market and customs union please... and a P45 for N Fartage.
pro	I am sick and tired of the British always carping and whining about Europe. You want to leave? Then leave!!
pro	"I am sick of being told by politicians and newscasters alike that when I voted ""leave"" that I was mislead. I voted ""leave"" and with it, all its consequences, good and bad. REMOANERS get over it and stop trying to mislead the electorate."
anti	I am smelling a huge recession in #UK after yesterday‚Äôs #Brexit plan.
pro	I am so angry at the whinging politicians who are in total denial as to the result of the Referendum. They were given a clear instruction by the people : LEAVE THE EU.
pro	I am so glad I am not a remainer. Many seem desperate for their country and fellow citizens to suffer so that they can be proved right. What a mean-spirited, narrow-minded outlook on life. And what if the UK does well? Will they simply become ever more embittered? Move on for God's sake, if only for the sake of your own mental health.
pro	I am so glad we have left the EU.....I bloody cried when I heard the results early in the morning.
pro	I am so happy we are leaving - Brexit has exposed the true colours of the EU bullies and how bad the Labour Party has become
pro	I am so happy we left
pro	I am so tired of the 2/3 argument. A choice not to vote is acquiescence to the final decision. Those under 18 have their rights to decide ceded to adults who have their interests at heart. We voted legally and lawfully. It came out Leave. Should it have come out Remain, I would have accepted it, voted to an MEP who would hopefully work to reform the EU and gone forward. I expected the same. Clearly not. The fact we have bungled the current process doesn't negate a decision made and the need to carry through with it. But hey, I'll keep your quote handy if we have a second Referendum and it comes out Remain. So we can go on to a 3rd, 4th and on and on until the EU builds a wall and asks us to leave or move to Canda.
pro	I am still a Leaver
anti	I am still hoping to remain...
anti	I am sure in a 1000 years, when the look back at the brexit mess, they won‚Äôt say ‚Äùthis was their finest hour‚Äù...
pro	I am sure the EU is just trying to scare----they don't scare me. We were fine before we went into the EU years ago, we would be fine whatever we did.......we have everything going for us
pro	I am tired of the EU being able to create our laws and regulations, being told what we can and can not do.
anti	I am truly sick to death of hearing Theresa May say ‚Äú the British people voted to leave‚Äù ! It‚Äôs a lie! Only 37% of the British people voted to leave . This is what she should be saying every time, she should not be allowed to say it as if it was all of us . Really makes me angry!
pro	I am very happy for the UK and hope soon EUXIT! We don't need the EU for import or export... and everything is coming from China, haha We don't want mass migration... and more then 60% where against the EU but pushed their EU into our throat... And their wet dream is to set up an army to fight against Russia... They don't like peace, they only like your money, haha
pro	I am very proud of England for taking a stand, and I support them
anti	I am voting #remain because I want my Britain back. A creative, generous, tolerant place. #strongerin
pro	I am voting Leave. I don't really like the idea of eurocrats in brussels deciding my future. I have found it amazing seeing friends on Facebook shout passionately about how voting In is the only choice and that believing anything other that that makes me an idiot racist. I have found the In campaign to be the vocal minority. I turn on sky news and it is just seems to be pushing doom and gloom for the UK economy if we leave. The current government just seems to be pushing fear and I am really bored of it. To say that the only way that we can exist as part of Europe and will only prosper as part of it, seems idiotic to me.
pro	I am voting leave for independents and more control to the people of England because I really disapprove of bureaucracy organisation I still to this very day accept the view that the Politian's should be in service to the public not the other way around.
anti	I am voting remain, I have swung back and forth a couple of times but now I am solid in my stance. If we leave Europe there is a chance it will be amazing for our economy, but why take that chance? Sure this country isn't nearly perfect at the moment but it isn't terrible, why put our future up to chance? Stick with what we know works.
anti	I am worried but when I aired my concerns on facebook I got verbally shot down by an aunt of mine. I was just worried about the future but I had to laugh because it will likely be my generation who will have to deal with the ramifications of it, not hers.
pro	I am, and always have been, a fervent Brexiteer. My concern however, is the potential impact on the availability of the medication that keeps me alive, and it's not trivial stuff, it's literally life and death. Quite recently I have given as much as ten days notice of my requirements of my medication, and they have not been forthcoming until the very last day.
anti	I and many other sensible people will have already maneuvered to ensure my EU citizenship is not stripped from me against my will, by taking advantage of the many loopholes available to claim dual nationality. Have your cake and eat it too!
anti	I assume all the Brexiteers who hate being run by unelected bureaucrats will now turn their attention to the House of Lords & fully democratising it. That‚Äôs assuming most even know it‚Äôs role, history & function. I won‚Äôt hold my breath.
anti	I barely hear the news...haven't since GE2019. No need EU are stronger & play by rules Trump & China R stronger We're weaker & Johnson lies Crap or No Deal Labour, LibDems, Greens can't win unless they become 1 new prog party. We have Rights Removed w/o Consent #Brexit is sh*t
anti	I believe I speak for a few fellow Europeans when I say that it's ∆í√∏√∂–∂√¨√±ƒù ≈°ƒ•√Ø»õƒô –º8
anti	I believe brexit will do a lot of damage to England and English people
pro	I believe everyone has accepted that the eu is a failed project, with the exception of a few brainwashed remoaner thicko's.
anti	I believe one can own a pellet gun or even a shotgun in England....and if one has to use it to protect another creature, one should never giggle about it on social media.
anti	I believe that the United Kingdom will be more comfortable if we stay in the economic structures of the EU.
anti	I believe that the difference between a remainer and a leaver is that a remainer knows they lost, a leaver doesn't know yet
pro	I believe that there is potential for things to improve due to Brexit
anti	I believe that you have been hood winked by a pompous leader who is only interested in profiting the rich but now it's too late for you to change your subordinate minds
anti	I believe the EU is a great thing
pro	I believe this country will thrive and prosper in the years to come.
anti	I believe we should stay in purely because there's far too much to risk if we leave. The Leave campaign cannot say anything with any certainty because nobody has ever left the EU. They seem to make out that we would be able to negotiate a utopian deal if we leave, particularly when it comes to immigration and trade. However, I doubt it will be that simple. If, for example, we were to leave and we still wanted to trade within the single market/EU we will still have to contribute to the budget without getting any say. That being said, the reason why I'm voting in has nothing to do with the In campaign. The campaigns for both sides have been shambolic and full of lies and the media have behaved abominably as well.
pro	I bet I'm not regretting my leave vote...and there has been no post Brexit disaster!
anti	I bet Ireland will never forgive the evil British. Serves Britian right that we Singaporeans kicked those colonists out of my country.
pro	I bet once boris gets tough with the EU, the EU will roll over like little puppy dogs.
anti	I bet that a mere year after Brexit kicks in a lot of Brits wish they were ‚ÄòRemanians‚Äô :-)
anti	I bet the Scots really wish they had their independence now.
anti	I bet this will be a disaster probably Ireland and Scotland will withdraw from the United Kingdom and Johnson will be begging the eu for a deal putting Britain even more under their thumb than when it was a member
pro	I blame the Remainers for consistently denigrating the UK economy and creating Project Fear stories . The latest such stories to bite the dust are financial services are relocating in their hundreds to the rest of the EU yet the number of job adverts for the UK is quadruple the number being advertised in the EU and it seems that applications from overseas to enter UK Universities is at its highest level ever contrary to the rubbish being spouted by University Chancellors. Even the F.T. has to admit very grudgingly the UK economy is doing much better than expected and is the EU economy of the big 4 which is actually looking the most positive .
pro	I brexit my life constantly¬†#brexit
pro	I can already see us all coming together! It's a truly beautiful spectacle!!!
pro	I can finally travel Europe without worrying about my arrest warrant in the UK
anti	I can hear fireworks. The stupidity of this country is unreal.
pro	I can honestly say that so far I have been hugely impressed with Boris and his approach to Brexit.
pro	I can honestly say that so far I have been hugely impressed with Boris and his approach to Brexit. If he continues on the course he has set he will become a national hero. Boris - we've all put our faith in you, don't let us down!
anti	I can imagine Putin drinking his wine with a happy face because of this
pro	I can imagine,that the EU will try to scold Britain for being defiant. And won't let you play in their games. As an American I hope we triple our trade's with Britain!
anti	I can only wish all of you in the UK who voted remain the very best, as you get dragged down the toilet of narrow-minded nationalism.
pro	I can't believe I'm saying this, but I don't think the EU can be reformed. Once in a generation vote; I have to switch sides #VoteLeave
anti	I can't believe all the Brexiters on here saying that the EU can't tell us what to do because we are now an independent and sovereign country - as if we weren't one before, only now we haven't got any friends or allies!
anti	I can't believe how much misinformation is in this comment section... It's really sad but apparently people is against international cooperation and that leads to war.
pro	I can't believe that there are still people in the UK who think that they are better off being governed by this bunch of crooks in Brussels, with no hope of a reprieve.
anti	I can't believe this is true 3 years on, but as someone who used to work with the EU, I find myself in tears about Brexit on a regular basis.
pro	I can't blame them...I'll blame the bureaucratic EU instead
anti	I can't help but feel that this could lead to a nasty turn of Events... Knowing that Britain might've played their cards wrong, I'd say that this poker game's won by the decision they've made as their money plummets down the drain... I have a slight gut feeling that this could result in a Britain version of the Great Depression. I'm American, but that doesn't mean I have extreme worry for other citizens that I could be friends with in another country! Prayers n' Hopes for the people out in Britain.
anti	I can't shake the feeling that a referendum was the worst way to do this
pro	I can't shout this loud enough, WE... NEVER... VOTED... FOR... A... DEAL.
anti	I can't sleep, can you? I am shaking with rage at the stupidity of this fucking shit hole country üí©üá¨üáß #StopBrexit
pro	I can't speak for everyone but I am British born and bred and those are my sentiments exactly. Good riddance to the EU
pro	I can't understand any one who wishes to stay in the EU
pro	I can't wait for Britain to leave the EU
anti	I can't wait for the UK to show the world that they can make it in their own.
anti	I can't wait for the moment that those that voted for Brexit and the tories finally understand that this isn't going to happen and that here is no cake, they can't eat it and what they can eat is chlorinated, GM, mass-produced filth.
anti	I can't wait to be homeless. Thanks, Brexit
anti	I can't wait to see the thick brexit voters lose their jobs and benefits
anti	I can't wait to see you get Redpilled
anti	I can't wait to watch this backfire miserably.
anti	I cannot believe we are subject to these bunch of clowns who really have no idea what Brexit will do to all of us.
anti	I cannot help but be angry at the heartlessness of our country. The older generation have put thousands of people's jobs and homes on the line. My mum might be kicked out of Britain because she comes from France. My cousin is half Thai. I have no idea what will happen in the future, and to be honest, I'm scared. I am 13 tears old.
pro	I cannot tell you how happy I am that we are leaving. It was the rise of UKIP that caused David Cameron to call the referendum.
pro	I cannot wait till we leave the EU , we just want out country back....Leave means leave !
pro	I cant wait until the 29th march 2019. Moment of truth for our democracy.
pro	I cant't believe I live in a country with so many fools. How can leaving the EU be a bad thing? It is a bad thing if you are a self serving mep, banker, rich wanker etc..But if you are just an ordinary Joe like me this vote out is a beautiful thing. Even with all the dark forces against us(95% of media) we still won! Why? Because people are waking up to the tyranny currently rampant in this world. The 1% speak for the 99% and times they are changing. No more. I won't take this shit anymore from a so called elite. No more.
pro	I can‚Äôt believe there are still Remainers on here whinging that they lost and we left the EU? Look boomers, why do you keep looking to history? We are not in the EU and sit in a global market of opportunity. The EU is so pass√©...
pro	I can‚Äôt wait for Hard Brexit. It will be the best ever!
anti	I can‚Äôt yet vote, and am completely furious with the result. Sixty-four per cent of my town‚Äôs votes were counted for leave, and I don‚Äôt think I have ever been so disappointed. Almost everything that made Britain great came from being a part of the structure of the EU, and I feel as if casual racism and colloquial xenophobic reactions to immigrants have blinded so many people to the extent in which they would rather rid immigrants than anything else ‚Ä¶there were so many benefits of being in the EU that people took for granted, and by the time they notice it‚Äôll already be too late. I feel scared for the future of the economy and the future of our country too. I am not feeling proud to be British, and I think that the majority of my demographic feel similarly.
pro	I care for our autonomy, vote leave!
pro	"I chose to vote Brexit because of the fact the EU is a dictatorship, not a ""democracy"". I still have my doubts about democracy, but at least I have a choice, albeit limited."
anti	I come from a screwed up country, the USA. But from what I've studied is that Brexit will be a mess. When you are in a union you have more variety and power; no union is perfect, but it is better than nothing. The UK has cut themselves off from a more stable base as I see it.
anti	I come from britain and BREXIT IS THE WORST DESCION
anti	"I completely agree. But it's both sides right? All politics comes down to emotions. ""Reason can only be a slave of the passions."" Brexit is driven by nationalism, nationalism is driven by ingroup favouritism. It is opposed by desires for equality and liberty. Desires have to be served by reason and reason has no desire. The Tory Brexiteers are the custodians of that Nationalist desire, it is their duty to use reason to further that desire. The average voter that wants that nationalist desire isn't in a position to finalise that expression. This is the role of leadership to handle that desire rationally. And what an absolute mess they have made."
pro	I congratulate every Englishman on regaining freedom. Only those who have never been FREE can put up with the constant patronizing of unknown bureaucrats. Everyone else doesn't like this at all. Switzerland will now certainly strengthen economic relations with England.üëç nice party, I am looking forward to seeing you. Best wishes and greetings from Switzerland
pro	I could not be happier for the people of Great Britain. Freedom always makes me smile.
anti	I could not believe when the news came up that UK had left EU. I started to think about it, and I think it is a loss for the EU. But it will be a higher loss for UK also. Europe is big, diverse. Uk, cannot only deal with USA and China for trade. We all need each others.
pro	I couldn't fathom another country making laws that our country has to abide by.
pro	I decided to vote leave at the last minute, I had been vote remain for the entire campaign but I couldn‚Äôt stand the idea of waking up tomorrow with nothing being done about the EU‚Äôs lack of democracy and lack of accountability. I am very restrained and humble right now and I understand that our country will experience a tough period but I‚Äôm hopeful for the future and my prospects as a young person.
pro	I deeply love my country and the things it has achieved throughout history and I don‚Äôt want it to become just another number in a nation called ‚ÄòThe United States of Greater Europe‚Äô
pro	I desire to leave because I want the final authority in this country to be westminster, not brussels. I want the UK to control its own fisheries, not bow and lend them to the rest of the EU. I want the UK to decide who comes into this country, not every other EU member state. Self determination is more important than short term GDP.
pro	I despise the way the EU is ran and there is no way for it to be reformed other than 27 countries seemingly agreeing to change it which will never happen as there will always be one or two who will vote against change for their own personal gain.
pro	I did it because based on the information i had at the time, it seemed the best thing for our country And yes, i would vote leave again
anti	I did my Master and PhD in Economics in London. I am personally very sad about Brexit.
anti	I did not vote for this, my fellow countrymen are idiots
pro	"I did see a remoaner tweet that accused a member of the crowds decision 2 ""black up"" showed the level of intelligence of leavers.However, the comment showed how shortsighted ""some"" remoaners are. It was actually a black gentleman wearing a union flag suit with sunglasses 2 match"
anti	I didn't support Brexit at all. There seemed to be very little motivation other than anti-immigrant and fear-mongering.
pro	I didn't vote 'Brexit' or 'No Deal', I voted 'LEAVE'! Listen to these morons desperately trying to save their own jobs by lying to the public. Twisted
pro	I didn't vote as i live in France & felt i did not have the right, But my eyes have been opened since the vote just how corrupt the EU is & what little they think of the British people, It defies belief how they have behaved & i suspect opened many more peoples eyes who like myself were ignorant to what they are really like, We are not going to float Britain away on a large raft to the other side of the world & Europe will be still there after we leave hopefully with no deal now, We are just getting out of a bad deal & plenty of deals could be done in the future as we do buy rather a lot from them, Mr Farage reminds me of the Marcus of Montrose who was hanged & later given a state funeral for his bravery & just actions & maybe one day Mr Farage will receive recognition for his hard work & dedication for the good of the British people.
pro	I didn't vote for cash or race reasons. I voted Brexit because global means complexity and more bureaucracy and less control. Gods save us from idealists.
anti	I didn't want to leave and as a young voter I'm bitter. I'm now genuinely worried about the stability of this country, principally the political fallout with London, Scotland and Northern Ireland been for remain however I don't expect a meteor shower when I wake up. Life goes on I suppose and now we need to work with the hand we been drawn. An era of political and economic uncertainly undoubtedly will now rein over my life for the foreseeable future and will probably impact my ability to enter the job market once I finish my degree. I'm not fond of the EU but I feared the instability of a leave vote more then a decision from the EU which we would've had a veto over.
anti	I didn't want to leave the EU
anti	I didn't want to leave the EU but did think the EU needed to change so if the only way to change the EU is for country's to leave then so be it
pro	I didn't want to leave the EU but did think the EU needed to change so if the only way to change the EU is for country's to leave then so be it. Sometimes you have to get rid the the old before you can have something new.
pro	I didn't watch any ads or any of the campaign material. I made up my own mind, and voted leave
pro	I didnt think this would happen. The people have Europe have surrendered so much power to government and elite globalist that I didnt think their votes mattered anymore. I am glad I was wrong.
anti	I didn‚Äôt realise no deal would mean we‚Äôd lose the ability to spell the word ‚ÄúGovernment‚Äù!!! Brexit is fraught with pitfalls!!!
anti	I didn‚Äôt wanna leave !
anti	I disagree. There is no 'best of Brexit'.
pro	I dislike being a constant money pig for the union.
anti	I do not hv any sympathy to those who talk of any Brexit without knowledge of the logical implications plus the massive short middle term damages to our economy and socially. The Brits MUST be fully aware Not to confuse NATIONAL PRIDE with COMMON SENSE.
anti	I do not know much about David Cameron but why tf would you let your citizens decide on something so monumental of you yourself say that it's better to stay in???? It's a no brainer!
anti	I do not see the EU as dictatorship. Quite the opposite. When I moved to Finland I did not have to get anyone's permission or a work permit. But if we leave I might even lose my right of abode and the same for hundreds of thousand of UK pensioners living in Spain ,Portugal, France etc... How is the Health Service going to cope with that influx? And many will need income support because housing costs are so much higher in the UK
anti	I do not support brexit but i understand their reason and sadly the negotiation will be hard. But i do not like that ppl voted not knowing what EU truly ment. Ans misleading lies from the far far right was also wrong.
anti	I do not think that Boris Johnson can call the shots here. Trade represents 40% of UK exports but only 10% of EU exports are to the UK. We will have to take whatever deal the EU is prepared to give us. Which is why Brexit was such a fundamentally flawed idea in the first place.
pro	I do not trust the EU or its clandestine operations.
pro	I do not understand how having sovereignty over your own soil can even be percieved as a negative thing
pro	I do not understand how having sovereignty over your own soil can even be percieved as a negative thing?
pro	I do not understand why none of the politicians grasp the Immigration issue. OTHER THAN THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BY THE EU. We do not have the infrastructure to cope, this is a simple fact. OUR local school is 33% over subscribed, that AFTER substantially increasing its numbers. A Staff nurse at our local hospital said she is spending THOUSANDS a week obtain interpreters for immigrants who cannot speak English when they attend A and E or appointments. THIS out of the NHS budget. The same hospital is closing a ward due to lack of funding!!! The politicians in this country live in their bubbles NOT the real world. I believe BREXIT will not only shake the EU to the core but bring some normality back to this country. SAFER OUT I firmly believe.
pro	I do not want to be part of federal Europe. We only ever voted for a trading partnership. Major signed the treaty without a public vote. The EU will not lock UK out of the EU because they can not afford to. UK will simply go back to the original treaty of the EEC.
anti	I do not wish suffering in the UK despite regarding Brexit as appalling. That is a dark road.
pro	I don't accept this analysis and I was a brexit voter.
anti	I don't agree with the U.K leaving the EU
anti	I don't believe in your plan, and will chose to pay my taxes in the EU wherever possible.
anti	I don't believe that the nationalist nutters and their manipulators on the Tory right could carry a referendum majority any more, but how this plays out in our rotten, cowardly Parliament or under FPTP voting is anyone's guess. We need a People's Vote and we need PR voting.
anti	I don't believe this is a very smart move, but time will tell
pro	I don't blame them for leaving under these circumstances
anti	I don't blame you. This lovely country has been taken over by racists and morons. There is no future here. If I was younger I would move to Europe too
pro	I don't care for economists. We need a NO DEAL :) Lets make Britain great again!
pro	I don't care if Brexit puts me on the streets That's what I voted for and that's what I want
pro	I don't care if Brexit puts me on the streets That's what I voted for and that's what I want I don't care if Brexit puts me on the streets That's what I voted for and that's what I want
pro	I don't care what it costs to get us 100% out of the clutches of the failing banking cartel that has halved its member states share of global GDP in 30 years with its ponzi scheme currency and protectionism and wrecked the lives of millions of unemployed Italians and Greeks and Spaniards thanks to the incompetence and lies of the European Commission and Council and the ECB, not to mention the EU removal of democratic leaders to suit its agenda. So when all the noise is over we will do a complete stock take on what has been achieved for our independence and sovereignty and if we've been lied to the fight will start again
pro	I don't consider Britain a European country anymore since the EU started treating us like fools when they were the foolish ones who have put Europe in such a financial mess
pro	I don't doubt that someone has said this earlier in this thread but I haven't read all the comments - so I say (in the words of that great patriot and Prime Minister, Winston Churchill) - this is not the end, nor is it the beginning of the end, but it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning. With no disrespect to our European neighbours, and with no wish to hark back to memories of earlier, more conflicted times, the 'democratic' majority of those who voted here in the UK to leave the EU have had their voices heard. Churchill also said We are with Europe, but not of it. European type politics of deals done behind closed doors has never been the way of Great Britain and the signing of treaties by successive Prime Ministers (who liked only Executive Power and who should have known better) without the expressed will of The People has, hopefully, been stymied forever. Ditto Parliaments and Speakers who think they are above and beyond the reach of the Electorate
anti	I don't hate these people nor think they're all racist. But they definitely are misguided. They will be the first to suffer as working-class voters. Where's all the huge amounts of EU funding going to come from? The Leave voters were lied to, as officially recognised by official statistics authority.
pro	I don't hear many good reasons to stay that we can't do ourselves
anti	I don't hold out much hope for the UK when ever after 2 years of negotiations people still cannot name the country they have a border with. smfh.
pro	I don't know ANYONE who didn't know what the EU was, I don't know ANYONE who regrets their vote to leave.
pro	I don't know if Brexit is the right decision or not, but I can at least see the reasoning behind it as well as the appeal. I'm also not a fan of the EU. I support the UK's decision either way and hope for the best.
pro	I don't know what to vote for. Both are scary. To me, you've now got in Europe a sort of government-by-proxy of everybody, who has now got carried away. Unless there is some extremely significant changes, we should get out.
pro	I don't know where it was or under what laws we weren't allowed to attempt to trade beef or lamb with the United States or China. But there you have it in black and white from the Prime Minister. We were only allowed to trade with the EU and that is why we had to leave, that is the inference of his speech. Now we can once again trade with the rest of the world and I think a market of 6 billion is rather better than a market of 600 million, don't you?
anti	I don't know whether Englishman are seeing this or not but they are divide and division will bring chaos .
pro	I don't know why I'm happy but I am
anti	I don't like Brexit voters
pro	I don't like free movement of people into the UK. I've made a fuck load trading currency, and will have no problems emigrating anywhere in Europe because of my skillset.
pro	"I don't like the direction that the EU is headed. To solve the issues they've having in the Eurozone they're going to need to push harder for the ""United States of Europe"" concept, which isn't what most of the people in the UK want. Yes, we have an opt-out of 'ever closer union', but that just leaves us on the fringe of a political union that'll be looking out for its own interests before ours."
pro	I don't mind brexit
pro	I don't mind them working here, if they pay their way, work hard and aren't here illegally then they are British people. It's the illegals and the EU power lords which piss me off.
anti	I don't often agree with a Tory. But he's right on this matter. The UK cannot make a monumental mistake and leave the EU.
pro	I don't really like the idea of eurocrats in brussels deciding my future. I have found it amazing seeing friends on Facebook shout passionately about how voting In is the only choice and that believing anything other that that makes me an idiot racist. I have found the In campaign to be the vocal minority. I turn on sky news and it is just seems to be pushing doom and gloom for the UK economy if we leave. The current government just seems to be pushing fear and I am really bored of it.
anti	I don't really see what UK will gain from leaving the EU. I think it's better to be part of a larger union and try to improve it rather than leave it and then get screwed over.
anti	I don't see any facts, all I see is blind patriotism and Toxcity.
pro	I don't subscribe to conspiracy theories as a rule but I find the media terror campaigns over Brexit highly suspicious. I have found it hard to ignore how the media tends to make such a fuss when they have an agenda and those agendas have virtually never been in the interest of the majority . The UK did the right thing leaving Brexit
anti	I don't think Brexit is going to help people in Britain.
anti	I don't think Brexit is good for anyone. Neither the EU, nor UK.
anti	I don't think Brexit is good for anyone. Neither the EU, nor UK. On the other hand The UK should only stay in the EU if it wants to be in the EU. I'm not in favour of them remaining if they just remain because it's too difficult to leave.
anti	I don't think GB realizes, that they would not just lose the trade agreements with the EU, but also the over 100 trade agreements, that the EU has with other countries.
anti	I don't think anybody has any idea what the economic impact of Brexit will be.
anti	I don't think it's a good idea, personally. There's simply too much red tape, and UK citizens are bound to feel an awful lot of pain if this goes through.
pro	I don't think people will just completley halt trading with us once we leave the EU. Also, the EU costs us quite a lot of money (¬£350 million a week IIRC) which could be used for other things, like improving the NHS for both the public and the employees of it. Fair Pay for those hard-working, dedicated people has never been the same since George Osborne royally fucked over their wages.
anti	I don't think the British people really knew the ramifications of what would happen after Brexit or not.
anti	I don't think the UK has yet come to terms with the fact it's now a small country
anti	I don't think the average Brit knew what they were voting for. The conservatives ginned up the fear factor, like they do here, and scared them into voting for something that is going to screw them over dearly. I can't see what's in it for the power brokers who pushed for it but conservatives usually just want to take anything that is positive for the working class and wreck it. The Repubs are still battling the 'New Deal' over here 90 years later. The Brexit deal, like most deals, is not perfect but they will regret stepping away from the EU, especially as haphazard as things are panning out now.
pro	I don't think the deal is anywhere near good enough for the United Kingdom. I will be voting to leave the EU.
pro	I don't think there is any reason for a second referendum. This vote was clear. We are leaving the EU. Just sort out the deal that we are going to transition to
pro	I don't think there is any reason for a second referendum. This vote was clear. We are leaving the EU. Just sort out the deal that we are going to transition to.
anti	I don't think we should be celebrating this. The economy is suffering and people are losing their jobs. Let's not revel in the misery of others.
pro	I don't trust any kind of major government which is so undemocratic (the parliament can't propose laws, those can only come from an unelected council of bureaucrats) so getting the UK out of it is needed.
anti	I don't understand British politics. Brexit just seems like a misguided isolationist/nationalist type thing. It's like when Trump wants us to leave NATO and shuns our traditional allies. It's sad to see the global community fall apart like this.
pro	I don't understand why Reddit is so against Brexit? The people voted. Pure democracy. Everybody wants more power to the people. It finally happened. Now Reddit is outraged. Fuck that. Having the EU in Brussels make binding agreements for people in the UK. Joke.jpg. The only reason l can think people are against it is because a right wing government is in power, if it were left wing, reddit would be praising the Brexit vote. Shows how skewed Reddit is.
pro	I don't understand why one person thinks a country will collapse if they leave. It was the same in the states when Trump was elected all the stars said they would move to Canada big deal.
pro	I don't understand, they haven't even tried Brexit yet, how can they complain that Tories are subverting democracy when they are pledging to do the same?
anti	I don't wanna leave London is my home town fam
anti	I don't wanna leave UK.
pro	I don't want anything to do with the EU it is a corrupt organisation run by incompetent bureaucrats.
pro	I don't want the UK to be just another State in the US of E.
pro	I don't want to be ruled by a foreign power any more I don't want a leader of my country telling me lies, that we are better off being run by this foreign power,
pro	I don't want to be ruled by an unelected elite in a federal europe
pro	I don't want to hear the argument of immigration is good for the country
pro	I dont even vote Conservative l, but I'm behind you on this. Don't dare quit.
pro	I dont regret voting leave, and never will. Anything that shakes up the globalist elites and makes them shit their pants is good to me.
pro	I dont understand why so many ppl that dont live in Britain think that brexit is so horrible this coming from an American but let them decide for them selves
pro	I dont understand, there is no debate to be had here. The majority voted, end of story. 2nd referendum? Voting until you get the result that you want is not democracy
pro	I dont want another referendum i voted out i want no deal
anti	I don‚Äôt believe brexit is the right idea, I don't believe it will work out well. We‚Äôre turning into a laughing stock.
pro	I don‚Äôt care if the EU needs us or not I just want to leave
pro	I don‚Äôt have a strong opinion. I don‚Äôt educate myself on everything else going on in the world. It‚Äôs their right to leave, and I hope it works out for everyone. Edit: I‚Äôm definitely rooting for the UK, and would love to see us become even stronger allies.
anti	I don‚Äôt know anymore!!!! UK can do very well with Europeans instead of standing alone!!!
anti	I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the whole Brexit happening today thing, or the fact I‚Äôm stressed and sleep deprived or what... but the vibes today...... disgusting
anti	I don‚Äôt know what I can say to really express how sad and angry I am today. Rights are being wrenched away on the basis of fraud, lies and law breaking. So honestly, the #Brexit architects can stuff it where the sun don‚Äôt shine. #StillEuropean #forevereuropean
anti	I don‚Äôt know why, but it all sort of feels like we‚Äôre on the Titanic. The Captain is blundering on, full steam ahead. The band is playing. But kinda feels like there might be something ahead.
pro	I don‚Äôt really see a reason for Britain to be in the EU Not my problem though
anti	I don‚Äôt think Britain is better without Europe,reason is because 85% of business Britain do through Europe.you imagine for ones,this business we do through Europe to be with Asia Africa or us is match Moore expensive business to do.every thing imported will be doubled on price.
anti	I don‚Äôt think that the grumpy old men and grumpy old women who swung the vote in favour of Leave care tuppence about the employment situation. They are either already retired or living a life of Riley on benefits. The drop in living standards as a direct result of the Brexit disaster is unlikely to percolate down to them for some considerable time, assuming they are still alive at that point.
anti	I don‚Äôt think we should leave the EU
anti	I don‚Äôt want Britain to be like that one person at the party no one wants to talk to #BBCDebate #EUref #Strongerin #INtogether
anti	I don‚Äôt want brexit to happen
pro	I don‚Äôt want the country my family died fighting for to be controlled by the countries that surrendered or tried to occupy us
pro	I don‚Äôt want to be dragged down by the Romanian or Greek economy
anti	I don‚Äôt want to leave & Im English
pro	I doubt 10 years from now many people will admit to being remainers.
pro	I doubt she (like many in the UK) likes the UK playing second fiddle to Germany alongside France in the EU very much.
anti	I dunno, at this point it seems like a good idea to take a step back and reevaluate the situation rather than barrel through and force a Brexit that seems to be highly unpopular.
pro	I enjoy the tears of many remoaners
pro	I enjoy the tears of many remoaners, this is a small victory that will not change anything, but hopefully this vote will have exposed all the Anti-English people currently residing in England and reaping all the benifits this country offers while spewing their hatred for everything British.
anti	I envy you so much.....waiting for DANEXIT
pro	I expect an explosion of prosperity in line with the Boris views.
pro	I expect my democratic vote honoured ,a full independent Britain and nothing less. Leave now so get it done.
pro	I expect to leave the EU. No deal is fine by me, in fact its what I voted for.
pro	I favour something closer to a Norway style arrangement with the EU and therefore I would still be a Brexit supporter.
anti	I fear any financial gains are swallowed up in the cost of the transitions , f knows how much Brexit has cost up to now . It may take decades if ever to be any ‚Äòbetter off‚Äô
anti	I fear that Theresa May's determination is turning into sheer stubborness. It is absolutely obvious that a deal will need more than two months to be concluded. What's the point in pretending to ignore it ?
anti	I fear the BrexiTraitors will succeed in destroying the UK economy for their own financial gain.
anti	I feel bad for the average brits who have been sold a lie but since the only way out is to admit that, then the next option is to see this through to it conclusion.
pro	I feel good for UK leave and clean up their government.
pro	I feel happy, I feel so sovereign now.
anti	I feel like all the ‚Äòleave‚Äô folk in the comments section fail to display any form of intelligence (or literacy).
anti	I feel like it's a pretty stupid choice that seems like it will only help a select group of wealthy people while hurting most of the people who were duped into voting against their own interests.
anti	I feel like many people do not see the great impact and were misled by the personal short-term goals of some politicians.
anti	I feel like the Brexiters know it's stupid, but they stand to gain significant personal financial rewards if it goes ahead, the more chaotic the better it is for them. They simply don't care about everyone else That's the only way they could justify the lies and false claims. I'm sure there's also a factor where when you preach stupidity for long enough you do start to believe it too.
pro	I feel like voting against leave would mean the preservation of British culture and it's charm would wade and wade until there's nothing left but a lifeless machine at the whims of Eurocrats.
pro	I feel optimistic about Brexit. I'll take my chance living mainly an ex-pat in the EU. As I see it Brits abroad bring wealth into the Southern EU (with high unemployment) since most don't work and yet spend money and buy property - whereas the EU has exported poverty and low/unskilled workers from its East to the UK in considerably understated numbers. Brussels has everything to lose by upsetting the UK. Masks are starting to slip everywhere.
pro	I feel physically sick when I hear Remoaners talk about job losses! We are fighting for our independence and sovereignty! WE don't care about job losses! We won two world wars! Out NOW!
anti	I feel sad at the levels of Nationalistic celebrations, I am sure history will remember this day in a different light. On a positive note, Nigel Farage and his army of goon MEP's have now exited the EU parliament and will no longer let the British people down with their far right views and disrespect for the other members of the union.
anti	I feel sad for the workers who are going to suffer because of Brexit. The popular discontent was never about trade--it was about xenophobia, inflamed by the far right for their own ends. But now the economy of this country will suffer massive collateral damage.
anti	I feel sick, I feel ashamed! You stupid ignorant people! Can I now vote to stop being British??? #Britain #VoteRemain #ashamedtobeBritish
anti	I feel so ashamed of what we‚Äôve become reading this account from a French person driven away by Brexit. Ashamed of what we‚Äôve become. People who have given years, decades of their lives to this country driven out by a xenophobic ideology and what it‚Äôs unleashed.
pro	I feel so happy today, beautiful sunny day and Brits no longer being bullied by the EU! Proud of my nation, and God save the Queen. Great things to come if we all pull together.
anti	I feel so let down by the people who could vote and decided to put their own personal hatred before others. Maybe this vote was too big for this country to handle. Throughout this all I supported remain and feel upset and angry over this result. Everyone my age will be left to deal with the consequences of this and I couldn‚Äôt even have a say in it. Evidence is showing the impact already over this, with the fall in the pound and I fear the worst is yet to come. I fail to understand why people aged 60 and above feel aggrieved by the apparent threats immigrants cause like lack of jobs and homes when they are already living comfortably with their pensions and houses when it‚Äôs young people who would be impacted by this, although I don‚Äôt personally feel like we are, yet people my age have no say.
pro	I feel so proud of my country.
anti	I feel so sad for myself to have to be born at a time like this.Can't wait to have to pay for everything! üôÑ
pro	I feel so sovereign again
anti	I feel sorry for all the working, tax paying, rational people in the UK who wanted to remain but are going to feel the brunt of the pain from the xenophobes
anti	I feel sorry for your country. Good luck, you guys are going to need it.
pro	I feel such pride that we are now an independent country again. We will flourish!
anti	I feel that it has been proven time and again by history that making far reaching decisions on the basis of nationalist egotism,like we are seeing so often today and not just with Brexit, is not going to end well.
pro	I feel that the EU¬†needs¬†to either fully federalise or draw back into a looser confederation
pro	I feel that when Britain leaves the EU we will be a shining example of an economy for most of Europe to emulate.
anti	I feel that you are trying to be too gentle with this topic. The bank of England predicted 10% GDP loss during next 10 years, the british pound might have as well been renamed the british stone after leave referendum, the figures Brexiteers give are plain fake. UK needs EU more than the other way around, and Brexit, from an economics perspective, is a horrible idea.
anti	I feel the US and UK are mirroring each other. Bad choices. Bad policy. Bad actors.
anti	I feel the leave campaign is purely built on a combination of speculation and bullshit. Remain on the other hand relies on information we have, and we all live in at the moment- which really isn't that bad.
anti	I feel unrepresented.
anti	I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. #BrexitDay
pro	I felt that the UK‚Äôs membership in the EU was putting both her own citizens as well as non-EU foreigners in the UK at an unfair disadvantage against EU citizens
anti	I find it really sad most of all. Because it seems like a such a clusterfuck of a situation with no winners.
anti	I find it ridiculous that so many people in the UK want brexit. After all half of their trade is with the EU, if they leave they could really hurt themselves and so far nothing negative has forced the UK to leave, they were doing fine in the EU before hand, if it ain't broken don't fix it.
anti	I find it sad that nearly 75% of 18-24 year olds voted to stay, yet the main demographic of the leave campaign was over 50s. Old deciding the future of the young.
pro	I find it unbelievable that the Labour Party, including Northamptonshire Labour Party County councillors, support a second referendum. We had a ‚ÄòPeople‚Äôs Vote‚Äô¬†back in 2016 in which 58.6% of ‚ÄòDaventry‚Äô voted to leave the European Union. I will do everything I can to see this through and will never accept a second referendum.
pro	I firmly believe that the EU as currently structured is doomed to failure.
pro	I for one can't wait to finally leave the corrupted EU, to make our own laws/rules , in recent months alls we've seen is threats and bullying from the likes of macron, Michel Barnier and the other fools, It reaffirms why so many of us voted for Brexit in the first place. It's just a shame that we have in fighting in our political parties , the people made there choice to leave and it should be respected instead of everyone pulling in different directions. The EU is a failing economic model. Britain has been one of the leading countries in the world for half a millennia and we have done this because of our ingenuity and capabilities, not because we have been lead by bureaucrats. Project fear is in full swing with media outlets suggesting that we'll struggle with food and medicine amongst other things , it's a big world out there and with the likes of the US, Canada and Australia saying they will be glad to do more business with us I'm excited for the future of the UK away from EU bureaucrats . RULE BRITTANIA
pro	I for one will welcome the return of more powerful hoovers when we finally leave!
anti	I genuinely believe a leave vote will go down as the worst mistake in British history when generations look back on this event.
anti	I genuinely believe a leave vote will go down as the worst mistake in British history when generations look back on this event. Edit: Some of my reasons for staying: 1) Better employment rights: minimum paid annual leave (currently at 28 days) 2) The current pregnant and paternity leave rights. May not be perfect but it's improved. 3) Fighting equal pay across the sexes. 4) Anti- discrimination rules in the workplace On the above 4 points it has been noted that the UK didn't want. I'm not saying the above laws wouldn't have happened anyways, but they may have occurred later (if at all), if the UK got its way. 5) Thanks to the EU roaming fees are a lot less. I don't have to buy a new SIM card each time I visit a European country and then inform everyone of a temporary new number. Businesses don't have to suffer as a result of having to change numbers in the midst of a deal when they go abroad. People at home can much easily contact you in an emergency as they can just message/call your existing mobile number. People who aren't aware you are abroad can still get in contact with you via phone if need be. 6) Standardisation of phone chargers. I imagine this would have happened eventually, but it was forced by the EU. All radio equipment (such as mobiles, locating beacons, cameras) are supposed to now use a micro usb. Think of the times you've not had a charger and needed one? 7) Schengen. 8) Ability to go anywhere in the EU to work and live freely with ease. If I wanted to work in France I am to be treated exactly as their home citizens, and not be disadvantaged by being foreign. 9) You can retire anywhere in Europe and still claim a British pension. 10) whilst abroad I can receive emergency healthcare for free via the EHIC scheme. 11) If I encounter flight delays or cancellations whilst in the EU, airlines have to compensate and accommodate me. This is not true (I believe) of the USA. 12) As an EU citizen if I face trouble abroad and cannot find a British embassy I am entitled to turn up at any EU embassy and they have to provide consular services. 13) The EU has introduced a number of consumer rights (the aforementioned cap on roaming fees) and a two year garuntee on all products. If we were to leave the EU, Chinese manufacturers may not make products sent to the UK to the same standard of the rest of the EU. These may not be arguments based on the economy or immigration and I've deliberately tried to stay away from that. I'm looking at things that affect me on a day to day basis and that is why I said my statement.
pro	I get the feeling that the Remtards still don't realise that they have lost and that we are actually leaving the corrupt Ponzi scheme that is the EU. We need a grand gesture to make them aware of what losers they are and something that will keep reminding them. I think a knighthood for Nigel Farage would do the trick
pro	I get very tired of Brexit deniers saying no one vote to Brexit thinking they‚Äôd be poorer. I voted Brexit regardless. I think that‚Äôs true of most brexiteers.
anti	I give it week.... until their economy collapses
pro	I give the EU 5 years tops. How long can two or three Countries bankroll 24 others?
pro	I glad I voted out
pro	"I got sick and tired of the constant political meddling - not just from Brussels, but our own politicians telling us how wonderful that meddling is. We have been absolutely overrun with EU migrants, more so than any other EU member state, and we're told how wonderful this is without any exceptions and only a swivel-eyed racist would believe otherwise. My area in particular has turned into Little Bucharest since the cap on Romanian/Bulgarian migration was lifted in 2014 and if you read any of the local press, reports of rapes, thefts, drink driving, the occasional murder (yes, really), and the perpetrator is very likely going to be called something like ""Florian Iliescu"" or ""Elena Sandu"". I was walking home one night and there were two police officers stood talking next to their cars outside the scene of what appeared to be a burglary, and I overheard one of them saying ""... yeah, the Romanians really haven't been behaving themselves around here lately ..."" Life here is too easy. We are too soft a touch and the government deliberately refused to apply the brakes available to them - if migration had been properly controlled and managed instead of letting in everyone without checks, a lot more people would have gone remain. Everyone aspires to get to ""England"" and I guess countries like France and Belgium are third-world warzones these days."
anti	I guess a lot of Remainers will need help packing as they prepare to move to an EU country!
anti	I guess no the uk can became even more inbred
anti	I guess nobody is surprised by this obvious act of xenophobia because this is EXACTLY WHAT the Brexiters voted for. Afterall, they elected Boris Watermelon Smile Letterbox Johnson to be their PM.Hence, I will never unite nor support this xenophobic racist Brexit.
pro	I had a few (discussions) with some of the younger members of my family over the past 2 years. Having seen the pantomime created by the remainers and their remain at any cost stance they now agree that we should leave. Same goes for Corbyn he was the best thing since sliced bread 18 months ago. Now he's seen for what he is. Someone who puts his socialist agenda before country
pro	I had a smoke with nigel Farage at CPAC in 2019. Hes a good guy
anti	I hate #brexit and the #conservative lie ‚Äúprotecting sovereignty‚Äù, whilst selling off sovereignty.
anti	I hate Brexit so much, i voted leave but i just wish i never hear about Brexit ever again.
anti	I hate all this crap the Government are doing because stupid people didn't think things through. My thoughts are with you and everyone else who is in this situation, and all the other subsets of society they will round on when you have left this unpleasant shitstream of a nation.
pro	I hate immigrants. Leave now
anti	I hate it and i'm embarrassed by the whole ordeal. You're voting to leave? Well you must be a racist. Voting to stay? You obviously don't care about your country and it's people. It's a farce. There has been zero facts and the whole thing has been fueled by attacks on the other campaign, rather than defending their own. We're being asked to make a huge decision without being given any solid facts whatsoever. If we can't discuss the issue like grown ups then they shouldn't be discussing it at all.
pro	I hate the EU. They let our enemies in on mass. As far as I'm concerned the European council and parliament, and every institution they created can burn.
anti	I hate the prospect of Brexit, and if I was old enough at the time would have voted remain. However, wishing death or ill will on anyone simply because they do not share your view (52% of the population) is disgusting.
pro	I have a new respect for my cousins across the pond . Farage , we need people like you in the U.S Congress !! Come here ! Cheers & Beers
anti	I have absolutely no doubt that there were many people who made a well thought out, educated decision about leaving & I genuinely respect that. But truth be told, the vast majority who voted leave did so out of a primitive patriotism & with no understanding of the implications.
pro	I have always recognised the benefits of being part of the EU, however I do not believe in centralisation of power. Being from just outside Belfast I cannot see how a foreign government can effectively legislate for many diverse regions
anti	I have always said Britain is the most reluctant country to change, modernise and update. Brexit is a prime example-It shows a country that refused to acknowledge that its empire was dead and never to be resurrected. It shows a country unwilling to co operate with a system it cannot rule over. It shows that it needs to rely upon nostalgia for its basic existence. It shows a country that has an education system straight out of the Victorian age. Britain is a an example of what happens when you fail to understand the world.
pro	I have always said we should walk away and if they want a trade deal they can come to us!
pro	I have decided we are going to colonise the Gal√°pagos Islands & turn them into a penal colony. Sent there will be, Republicans, Scottish Nationalists, & people who visit Blackpool through the holiday season! Let‚Äôs make the British Empire Great again! #Brexit
anti	I have felt European since I first set foot on the mainland 75 years ago, so am deeply disappointed as are many of us
anti	I have gone the other way, I just want the EU to completely fuck us over now, crash out with a no deal and no other trade deals in place, just a complete cluster fuck. Then maybe people will understand that voting for nonsense doesn't work
pro	I have hope this decision changes UK, and changes EU, maybe make other countries exit
pro	I have hundreds of friends and not one has changed their minds on leaving the Cartel. In fact, they are more resolute on leaving.
pro	I have many times in my life been against the outcome of a general election, but I don't immediately demand and plot for a re-run.
anti	I have never felt less British. For those who voted out due to immigration, maybe they forgot who treats them when they are ill, or teaches their children, or keeps their area clean, they are ignorant to how much many immigrants contribute to our society. I am incredibly scared about the prospect of my future. Who knows if my parents will be able to afford for me to go to university? The imminent fall of the pound suggests further economic downfall, my future was left in the hands of people who I‚Äôve never met, whilst the 16- and 17-year-olds of the country, on the edge of our future, were not allowed to vote and now have been left isolated on our tiny island. Just like all my friends now, I am close to tears, the prospect of such a severe unknown is so unnerving and I feel like we‚Äôve already begun to fall apart. I think we‚Äôre all acutely aware that had 16-year-olds been allowed to vote, it would have been a different outcome. Please pray for our futures.
pro	I have never had any sort of 2nd thought. I voted out because I am thoroughly sick of the EU - an anti-democratic genocidal construct designed to erase nation states and alter their genetic make-up. When you see people like Blair and Merkel getting the EU's Kalergi prize you know that is true - if you don't know what the Kalergi plan is, look it up.
pro	I have never heard such ignorance. This idiot just stood on that stage and insulted everyone who voted to leave the EU. There is nothing wrong with nationalism and wanting to control your country's borders.
pro	I have never seen so many stupid people all in one place ( although there was only one brain cell ). WE voted out and now there are more countries of the world to trade with than there was being locked into Europe. The one thing this country lacks is patience they act like Americans we want it all and we want it now ...............well things do not happen like that we have voted we are leaving Europe so back off and wait for the out come like the MOST of us that voted to leave. I do not care how we leave they will need us more that we need them. Europe was full of corruption ripping us off and it went to the very top.
anti	I have never thought that the Brexit result was legitimate. It was always a right wing Anglo American billionaire led coup. It is about ruling us more effectively by the Tory right wing.
anti	I have no confidence in Western Civilization anymore... Brexit, France, Russia and Trump..¬† Its time for me to move Australia..
pro	I have no regrets what so ever. The EU is moving closer and closer to becoming a federation.
anti	I have no words for those who voted Brexit
anti	I have not been following this very closely, as we have so many problems here at home. Just seems to me though that this is not a really great idea. Boris Johnson appears to be cut from the same cloth as Donnie Trump and that is not a compliment. Go ahead! Make your comments! I admit I'm not that well informed!
pro	I have not changed my mind about brexit at all. Undemocratic multi-millionaires and celebrities are telling me it's a big mistake and the country will be destroyed. These are the same people with houses in France and Italy and bank accounts in Switzerland.
pro	I have nothing against foreigners, But look what happened years ago when Enoch Powell said no to foreigners coming into the country, all parties kicked him out, Now look what has happened, the uk won't be the uk any more if we stay in and will end up having a foreign flag flying over us instead of our union jack.
anti	I have one finger on each hand reserved for Brexit and the Senate. I‚Äôll let you guess which ones.
anti	I have one question for the mentally deficient people who voted for unicorns. Name me one EU law which you don't like. Apart from wonky bananas and laws which have actually been made by English politicians and judges.
pro	I have one thing to say: E.U. sucks and it is making the world worst
pro	I have reluctantly voted to leave (I have worked for the EU and seen enough).
pro	I have said all along they are terrified of losing control over us. With May this wasnt a problem as Selmayr was heard to say but the landscape has now changed.
anti	I have the same reasoning as someone from the north of England. Northern cities receive so much funding from the EU while Westminster would rather see us rot. So much regeneration in places like Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle came about because of Objective One EU funding. I'm scared that leaving will bring about another Thatcherite annihilation of the north.
anti	I have to applaud any MP that displays such passion in defence of their constituency. Brexit is a clear failure with no decent compromise except at the expense of those of us dwelling at the bottom. This needs to stop. May has failed and all others that follow will too.
anti	I have tried and tried to find positive but Brexit scares me so much I can‚Äôt help it, I am British AND European and will always be no matter what.
anti	I have yet to find anything that, to me, would justify leaving, but there are plenty of things to be critical of the EU for. I have found the attempts to try and regulate every single thing frustrating, as logic is often missed. I have also been annoyed that they neutered paint stripper, due to H&S or something, meaning I can't get good liquid/gel paint stripper now and have to watch in sadness at the nice stuff in America (admittedly more toxic but fine if you use precautions) Recently they have gone back to wanting to ban halogen lightbulbs, this would pretty much kill the small theatre industry. So yeah, there are things I feel the EU does wrong, and aspects of the organisation that are frustrating, but it would be better to be in than out. We are only going to get screwed over by leaving.
anti	I have yet to hear a convincing argument for the Leave side. I really get the in impression thay it's mostly just xenophobia driving it. Also, from my limited understanding, Scotland and Borthern Ireland are getting fucked pretty hard by this. Also, i feel bad for May. I think she inherited a dumpster fire here. I hope that in the next couple weeks the government decides to have another referendum, or better yet just collectively agree to forget this whole thing happened.
anti	I have yet to meet any normal people on the continent who think keeping the UK is worthwhile. Please go off by yourself and sink your miserable, sad country, Brexit is really the UK unable to accept it is no longer very important.
anti	I have yet to see one single positive thing to come from us leaving the EU, except some BNP, sorry Tory donors will avoid some very large tax declarations....
anti	I haven't heard any Leave MPs saying that Brexit will be a success for about a year to 15 months now. Certainly it's considered common knowledge that we'll all be poorer., with less opportunities - and that it will especially hurt the poor. No-one even debates that any more.
pro	I haven't met anyone who regrets their leave vote.¬† No regrets from me.
anti	I haven‚Äôt seen that many White Nationalists since Trump‚Äôs last Hate Rally.
pro	I heartily endorse Brexit, Britain is not a European country, it has fundamental differences in its ideals.
pro	I heartily endorse Brexit, Britain is not a European country, it has fundamental differences in its ideals. It doesn't help anyone to subordinate themselves to a system which seeks to eliminate their national identity and rejects their sovereignty, all the while led by a group of unelected leaders.
pro	I heartily endorse Brexit, Britain is not a European country, it has fundamental differences in its ideals. It doesn't help anyone to subordinate themselves to a system which seeks to eliminate their national identity and rejects their sovereignty, all the while led by a group of unelected leaders. The fact that the British government has done everything it could to sabotage the will of the British public is just another example of the establishment wanting the pretense of democracy to keep people placid, but constantly undermining their own country for their own power and benefit.
anti	I honestly can't say this enough but fuck brexit, fuck British insular attitudes, fuck the UK union and fuck the Westminster government twats. My country didn't want this. My country didn't vote for this and our people deserve fucking better #LeaveALightOnForScotland
pro	I honestly can't stop grinning since Brexit day
anti	I honestly don't think this will make any difference including the immigration problem people seemed to mainly vote for.
anti	I honestly hope all the people who supported this stupid nonsense never speak or vote again and basic common sense can return...
pro	I honestly think the UK, Sweden, Finland, Luxembourg, Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands can survive without the EU.
pro	I honestly thought by the headline I was going to learn what‚Äôs next! What a waste of an article
pro	I hope Brexit hurts the EU and gives it the kick up the ass it deserves.
pro	I hope Brexit will deliver and succeed the Democratic vote...
anti	I hope Brexit wrecks the UK and dim witted Brexit voters suffer the most. You deserve it.
anti	I hope Britain does NOT leave the EU. Make the EU relationship work for you
pro	I hope Britain makes it out of the EU to show the way for the other countries. I am pro European, but the EU nowadays is not
anti	I hope Britain suffers. It's about time that history punishes them.
anti	I hope EU will punish UK badly for such a horrible idea as Brexit. EU cannot afford spreading the idea of leaving the EU among its members.
pro	I hope England gets independence
anti	I hope Europe gets more prosperous as a result.
pro	I hope May's deal is voted down. The only acceptable outcome is a no-deal Brexit.
pro	I hope UK leaves, that would be best example how country flops after leaving EU. Thanks.
anti	I hope UK stay in EU. Im brazilian but i admire the European Union. Each coutry is better being part of it than alone i think.
anti	I hope after voting to stay in the EU, the UK joins the Eurozone and let go of their outdated currency and join the 21st century. It will also make vacations in Europe easier and more efficient.
anti	I hope for Scotland to declare independence from England and remain part of the EU.
anti	I hope it fails and the UK has to go back
anti	I hope one of those Brexit leaders like Boris take over and realize how fuckin stupid and unrealistic it is to expect to an awesome deal from the EU to leave. Take responsible for your own goddamn actions.
pro	I hope other countries will leave the EU when they see how it actually goes.
anti	I hope people starve and are unable to get their necessary medicines as a result of Brexit.
anti	I hope sovereignty will give ppl a job and put food on the table. All that will be harder with Brexit as the country becomes poorer.
anti	I hope that Britain suffers royally from their decision to go through with Brexit.
anti	I hope that Scotland and Northern Ireland will leave the Union and that the people of England and Wales are faced with severe hardships as a result of this stupid move.
anti	I hope that its absolutely clear for everybody what the consequences are when the UK is leaving te EU. The EU needs the UK, the UK needs the EU !
pro	I hope that my loved Italy goes whit brexit and let the europe union tho eat erself. O come diciamo in Italia = VAFFANCULO
pro	I hope the EU burns to the ground
anti	I hope the EU punishes UK so that other nations don't follow Britain.
pro	I hope the corrupt EU burns and crashes
anti	I hope the option of no brexit is still possible
anti	I hope the people of the north, especially the traditional manufacturing, mining towns etc, get the brexit they deserve and I've got a feeling that's exactly what's about to happen.They will only have themselves to blame unfortunately.
anti	I hope the worst of the business failures & job losses happen in the Brexiteer areas. They voted Brexit, they should get to feel the consequences of their actions
anti	I hope their is a 2nd vote now the lies of the #Leave campaign have been revealed. #Brexit #EUref #VoteRemain
pro	I hope they ban these EU trolls from posting on these comment boards in the near future. They've surely outlived their usefulness. To my fellow Brexiteers, I wish you a Happy UK independence Day,
pro	I hope they get out, European Union is trash, especially coming after Google
pro	I hope they leave
pro	"I hope this is the start of the ""Domino effect"".. Enough wasted hard working tax payers money given to the EU gravy train."
pro	I hope those english leave very fast
anti	I hope to God that this ends well. But in the hands of Boris Farage, I worry.
pro	I hope we come out of the EU. Its what I voted for.
pro	I hope we do leave the Eu, nothing wrong with what these people are saying don't know why everyone has got to bash them based on it, at the end of the day the leave v stay polls at the moment are very close so no point giving these people crap because there's plenty of us that feel this way
anti	I hope you stay, greetings from Germany
pro	I hope, that EU will disintegrate.
anti	I just curious to know how uk will strive economically after this
anti	I just curious to know how uk will thrive economically after this doesnt seem possible
pro	I just do t want individual nations to lose their identity. Like I would identify as British rather than European.
pro	I just do t want individual nations to lose their identity. Like I would identify as British rather than European. And I am afraid that that may happen
anti	I just don‚Äôt think I really believed it would happen.... now I‚Äôm terrified it actually will. I mean how can something with no tangible benefits and a massive loss of personal freedoms actually happen
pro	I just don‚Äôt think that Islam is compatible with the west. I just don‚Äôt think that people who believe in child marriage and terrorism should be in the United Kingdom, or Europe for that matter. That book poses a threat, and as long as that book exists there will never be peace in the west.
anti	I just emigrated.
anti	I just feel grief. I'm almost certain it'll be a no deal disaster at this point and that my generation are well and truly ruined. We're going to be the people shouldering the 2nd great depression, and the worst part is it's entirely the elderly's fault.
pro	"I just got trolled by a German who told me, ""Prepare to eat tinned food only."" I had to set him straight that I'm Scottish and there's more sheep and cows than people here. Massive fail! Rather like the EU generally."
pro	I just hope Britain can get back it's culture. It's such a shame that so much of Britain has been taken over. I pray that they will stay independent. Good for them.
pro	"I just love the genuine hurt and salt from continentals. It's hilarious how naive you all are about this. All you people have done is make the same tired arguments, same crappy jokes about the delay, without realising your superstate government literally caused it. When Donald Tusk stood down he admitted to doing everything in his power to stop Brexit, and left a message for all the remoaners telling them to ""never give up"". What does that say? The EU love meddling with our democracy. They really really REALLY had the upper hand when our government had no majority. We had one of the weakest and most incompetent conservative leaders as well, Boris did what she couldn't in 3 years. It's hilarious how blind you truly are. You think we're going to crash and burn because of Brexit. Because we'll be leaving an undemocratic political hub. You think our economy is going to crash but why would it? We spend more of our GDP than we get out, not only that, but we're one of the five global powers. What reason does our economy have to suffer? Oh, and ""most of our trade comes from the EU"", wow really??? I never knew that, I truly wonder why we voted to leave. All you faggots have done is point and laugh at us in the process, talking about this like it's a comedy series, making naive remarks about more delay, now look. We've actually left. It's like what Nigel Farage said ""you all laughed at me at the beginning, but in 2016 you stopped."" Of course the scaremongering won't stop though. You'll still carry on fretting about our economy crashing for X reason, Y goods being of poor quality. Or our 300 year old union breaking up. Well keep telling yourself that. I will enjoy licking the salty tears of continentals that make the same tired arguments now that we're leaving. Or better yet the doublely braindead TLDR viewer base."
pro	I just voted Leave to get the Muslims out
anti	I just want to put out there that I totally get it if Scotland wants independence from the #Brexit shitshow that is the U.K., and whether they are part of the U.K. or not they are our neighbours (and colleagues in my case) and I bloody love you.
pro	I just want to see us in control of our own destiny.
pro	I just want us to leave the eu, no deal will do!!
anti	I just watched Barnier and he didn't demand anything, he said it is up to the UK to decide what it wants to do. Rubbish inflammatory Mail headline and the mug Brexiteers fell for it yet again
anti	I kinda feel bad for Theresa May. She was basically made the captain of a sinking ship where the previous captain held a vote on whether or not to sink the ship and then took the only lifeboat when, lo and behold, people voted to sink the ship. Now she's in a position where she obviously doesn't want the ship to sink, but no one can agree on how to patch the holes.
pro	I knew exactly what I was voting for and still do not regret my vote to leave, in fact I want out more than ever before. I have not met one leave voter that has changed their mind or regrets their vote.
anti	I know 52% voted for brexit, but times has changed since then and people have allready seen the effects now. As i see it, even with the corruption of the EU parlament, it is STILL worth it for britain to stay in EU.
anti	I know I talk smack about #brexit but it's actually the most ridiculous thing to happen. It was a populist and immature move my Cameron and now Britain WILL absolutely suffer. I also know that all my friends / family and normal minded people voted #remain
pro	I know brexit is frustrating and scary, but it's out of the box now. It won't go back in. We can either move through it, or be messing about with it for the next decade, perhaps even crashing out with no deal after all.
anti	I know it is hard for Brexiters to understand that many on the continent value other things than just cash. Like belonging to a union of equals. Like having rights over a whole continent. Like cooperating.
anti	I know it's not at the top of everyone else's list but there's one topic which never gets enough coverage in this debate: UK citizens like me who live and work in the EU. I read the other day that there could be 2 million of us. Many of us would be at risk of losing our jobs and homes, and needing to arrange complex paperwork for spouses and families just to repatriate (which, incidentally, is not something I want to do). It feels like we're faced with the choice of applying for citizenship in our host countries or risk losing everything. Quite apart from that, imagine the pressure on the job market, etc, if many of us are forced to return.
pro	I know it's not easy for upper middle class metropolitan elite types to lose to the riff raff that we all know you really think the rest of us are, but that you lost the argument, after investing so much in trying to win it. But this should be a wake up call, that involves some self reflection, but instead there has been an increase in the amount of trolling of your somewhat antagonistic views, that you inflict on the rest of us.
anti	"I know it's not very ""politically correct"" to say it out loud but in the wasteland of ruined Britain I am going to hunt and eat old people"
anti	I know lying worked to get us out of the EU but a bit less obvious next time.
pro	I know that we can turn this opportunity into a stunning success.
anti	I know this is trivial compared with the other reported disastrous outcomes of leaving the EU...
anti	I know two people who voted in 2016 for BREXIT have since died. Why should the current population suffer the consequences? This is not democracy it is stupidity.
anti	I know very little about UK politics, but anyone who looks like Trump with a bowl cut can‚Äôt be good....
pro	I laugh you:)))))economical level of turkey and salaries are better in turkey than in uk. please make more research.
anti	I leave Downing Street 10 times more skeptical than I was before
anti	I like the fact that all those Leavers are publicising the fact on their personal timelines that most of us want to Remain üôÇ
pro	I like the idea of the EU and despite wide spread calls for reform they seem to fall on death ears. Whilst I agree that staying in it is the best way to achieve reform, ultimately its needs a catalyst and Brexit might achieve this.
pro	I like the people making laws that I have to abide by to be accountable to me and the rest of the public. We haven't yet been allowed to veto any of the laws the EU puts through, and we don't get a vote on who runs the EU. It's a dictatorship with less fewer executions.

anti	I like to feel more European then Brittish
pro	I like what you say Mr Johnson , dont let us down , we believe in you !
anti	I liked someone say in a comments section of a Brexit related video that Brexit is a warning what happens if one's ego and IQ are inversely proportional
anti	I listen to 'Ruin My Life' by Zara Larsson when I think of Brexit
anti	I live in Finland and i buy English stuff, but not any more if brexit happens
anti	I live in France for a British company so I see all perspectives of this. Therefore my conclusion is for the UK to leave the EU is pure madness, and the UK would be hurt most of all.
anti	I live in Scotland and I voted to remain within the EU. In fact the whole of Scotland voted to remain within the EU
anti	I live in Wales, we are more supported by the EU than by London. There's really no contest about which way to vote if you're in Wales or NI. Stay. If leave hits then it's just going to be a matter of time before Scotland leaves the UK and then it'll be time for Wales to campaign to do so as well. Also, not needing a visa to go visit Europe? That's just amazing, I wouldn't want to give that up for the world. Edit: Inbox replies disabled. I've written a very abbreviated version of what I think and feel with generalisations with this message and I don't want to get drawn into a debate or a discussion.
pro	I live in a 'Labour heartland' and I can tell you that the main reason for leaving Labour is immigration. Blair opened the doors and changed communities. People are open but too many came at once.
anti	I live in a true blue Tory borough in Surrey. Lib Dem's are the only party to say no to brexit! They've got my vote.
pro	I live in the US and identify as a Democrat, but it appears that hard brexit is the best option. It gives the UK the power to set the rules in their own country
pro	I live in the US and identify as a Democrat, but it appears that hard brexit is the best option. It gives the UK the power to set the rules in their own country.
anti	I lived in England for five years back in the 80s and loved it. Kills me to see it turn to shit over ignorance.
anti	I lived there for 20 years when the vote came around it was spun around in immigration. Many voted leave because they honestly thought that they're would not be any more immigration into the country. This is the reason Boris did not want a revote recently. It's a sad day
anti	I long back to how bad I thought Brexit would turn out one year ago. One year on and somehow there seems to be even less of a plan and those in charge seem to have even less of a clue what they are doing.
anti	I look at this and think, im so glad to live in the netherlands and be part of an actual working economic union called THE EU, have a nice life try not to die UK peeps
pro	I look forward to the UK reclaiming its sovereignty and sense of independent freedom come 29th March 2019. Rule, Britannia!
pro	I love Brexit
pro	I love Britain and desperate to save it for my future generation by leaving EU.
anti	I love Brits, snobbery and all but I think they're going to learn a hard lesson, here.
anti	I love Europe and I love the EU as its legislation makes it easy to look for opportunities outside your own country. I shall always be pro-EU. I ought to have been born some 40 years later in order to fully enjoy the possibilities that the EU offers. I thank all the EU countries and send my warmest regards from Finland:)
anti	I love Europe and I loved the freedom we once had to just pop in from time to time. Personally, Brexit has meant that my future career plans are very much balanced on a knife edge.
pro	I love Europe, but I hate the EU and the Brussel bureaucrats telling us what to do and when to do it with our own money. The EU is un-democratic.
anti	I love being in the EU, I don't want UK to leave it.
anti	I love free shipping, i love immigrants
anti	I love free shipping. Stop brexit now
pro	I love how the video is titled in a way that tries to put in peoples mind that Britain lost something...no the EU lost something.. a part of it literally removed itself.
pro	I love remainers telling thicko leavers what they didn‚Äôt vote for- but as thick as we are we can smell a rat on Norway, 2nd ref. and extension of article 50 to discuss deal- what we did vote to do was LEAVE - and none of the above does that. As we say up north Let‚Äôs get gone!
anti	I love that Leavers talk about this issue in terms of winners and losers!... No one won anything, in brexit we all lose together as country.
anti	I love the nationalistic hypocrisy that‚Äôs rolling up here. The former Great Britain was great because of its colonies and everything that scavenge from there. If leaving EU is the next big thing in their agenda that will only bring isolation and provocation to the rest of the world to apply ‚Äúspecial regime‚Äù for British nationals.
pro	I love the smell of Liberal tears in the morning .......smells like Victory. Make it a double in November Americans; then time to Liberate Europe AGAIN!!!
anti	I love the stale reek of Brexit in the morning
anti	I loved my British Heritage. Now I‚Äôm embarrassed that I have such racist countrymen.
anti	I mean ... the loss of freedom of movement is catastrophic for my industry. No Googling needed, just a massive reduction in working opportunities and income for us all.
anti	I mean for my age, I guess I shouldn't be too concerned, but I keep getting paranoid thoughts about losing everything
anti	I mean...impede brexit fuck brexit kill it just no one gives a fuck it ruins people's lives fuck Theresa may actually no don't she's probably got teeth in there anyway JUST GET IT OVER WITH OR DON'T GET ON WITH IT AT ALL!!!!!! FUCKING ISRAEL WILL BE BETTER THAN THE UK
anti	"I met a lad at the pub hosting 'Brexit Night' celebrations who said he knew little about the EU, 'didn't really do politics', and admitted that he was only there for the free curry. I told him ""well then, you'll be glad to know that you won't now be called up for the EU army."" He looked a bit stunned."
anti	I might not be there but I feel the pain they are suffering and are going to suffer.
anti	I might see it wrong because i belave it to be extreamly stupid for england to leave. Tell me what from the EU affects any of you the english people personly in a bad way? I only see the media and the numbers of economy data but not the people so tell me pls.
anti	I miss the good old days when Brexit wasn't part of our vocabulary. It never should of happened.
pro	I must admit, I have been pretending to be against Brexit for a while now because of pier pressure, it‚Äôs good to see that other people have spoken there minds üòÑ
pro	I must assume that you came to this country because there is something about Britain that appealed to you. You came here, want to settle, and be British. Which means you have some stake in the future of Britain, right? The elephant in the room in the brexit debate is immigration, and we're not talking about high skilled, educated, legal immigrants like yourself. We're talking about the other immigrants. The unskilled, illiterate, and ultra-religious. These people are going to destroy British culture. They come here and do not integrate. Indeed they cannot these people are illiterate in their native language, speak no English (and no intention of learning), cannot get a job here, and come from a culture that is antithetical to our own, and (given our birth rates vs theirs) in 20 years there will be more of them than there is of us. This country that you've chosen as your home will not be here in 20-30 years if this continues.
anti	I never consented to have my EU citizenship removed against my will.
pro	I never regret brexit, I want to get out without, yesterday
pro	I never regret brexit, I want to get out without, yesterday. A no deal is even better! Get us out! teresa May is traitor these politicians are traitors, and they should be trialled for treason. People said Out!! Out!! We want Out!
anti	I never thought Brits could be so crass.
anti	I never thought of it in the sense that the EU is essentially a safety check against disgusting governments like our current one and that EU funding does a lot, even for the disadvantaged. Neck, I feel the EU supports the poor of this country better than the actual government.
pro	I never voted for any deals... I voted to All out LEAVE the EU and Single Market Bloc!!!
anti	I never wanted it. I voted remain.
pro	I never, ever,ever go on holiday to Europe. I would rather eat my own p o o !
pro	I now see Brexit as the last great opportunity to kickstart the European project over again
anti	I now strongly support and will democratically fight for a re-entry to the EU, even without all the special arrangements, which the UK enjoyed
anti	I often travel into the EU to play live music. That's my career fucked then.
anti	I over heard my manager who has 5 kids and earns ¬£8.50 an hour say she is gunna vote boris because she doesnt want to have to pay tax for immigrants, its at that moment i gave up on democracy.
anti	I personally didn't vote to leave I voted to stay the concequences and repercussions we will have from leaving the eu will continue to grow and halter our economy.
anti	I personally don't think it was a good idea at any point.
anti	I personally feel very worried for the future. The value of the GBP is still 20% less than what it was and seems to still be dropping. I'm also annoyed that 16-17 year olds were not given a vote (They were given a vote in the Scottish Independence Referendum, but not in the EU Referendum). I'm disappointed that people decided not to listen to experts on the subject, instead tuning out the academics in favour of the Daily Express. I'm disgusted by the increased number of hate-crimes against minorities committed by people who feel that such behaviour is acceptable, and I feel uneasy about the future. I feel just as nervous about it now as I did on June 24th when the results came in. All I can say is, thank god for dual citizenship,
anti	I personally think Brexit is just a pep talk that will never happen and that should not happen for the lives of 500 million people.We should be the ones to make changes not the MP, us, we need to make the world a better place,a safer place!
anti	"I personally think it was a huge mistake and a bad thing for the UK and EU. Secretly, it makes me laugh and I'm very entertained watching the ""enlightened"" Europeans experiencing the very things they often lecture others about. Hard to criticize others when your union is starting to literally fall apart from the inside out. How could that possibly be?"
pro	I personally voted to leave because as a teenager at school when we voted to enter EEC i was taught how great free trade would be.At the time no one was aware of the loss of power,laws and stupid EU laws and more important no vote on the leadership of the EU.If you don't like how your country is ruled you vote in another party,that doesn't work in the EU.To me it was not about immigration it was the fact we where not told how the EU would develope. May be the older generation felt hoodwinked in the past.I like the idea of the EU but not the way it is turning out.
anti	I plan to ignore the news today, I'm far too upset about leaving the EU. Part of me remains European
pro	I pray Brexit will deal a huge blow to the EU and to all the globalists who own it! May God bless Mr Boris and Mr Nigel....for turning Britain away from the jaws of EU..
anti	I pray for a second referendum. I prayU.K. will remain in the European union
pro	I pray that the brexit will be successful one day.
anti	I pray to God we the United Kingdom remains within the European Union!!!! because the UK is much stronger inside the EU. Remaining in the EU opens up more doors towards prosperity for us. PLEASE VOTE REMAIN ON 23RD JUNE
pro	I pray we are OUT..Give my grandchildren HOPE!! GOOD LUCK BREXIT!!
pro	I prayed for this day
anti	I predict that the only thing in defence of a no-deal Brexit is just that it will show every nationalist idiot what Brexit truly means
anti	I prefer to stay in the EU
anti	I promise to vote stay this time.
pro	"I raise my glass brilliant... lets put the ""Great"" back into Britain onward and forward.. from now on.."
anti	I read a transcript of this. I was embarrassed for him.
anti	"I read somewhere ""Brexit will go down in history as the worst case example of direct democracy"""
anti	I realise that but Brexit will be far worse.
anti	I really can‚Äôt see how the UK is going to survive this intact. The divisions are growing all the time. All BJ‚Äôs talk of healing is just posturing, playing to the crowd. How long can he realistically deny the Scottish government a referendum after what‚Äôs happened with Brexit. He‚Äôs more unpopular there than Thatcher was. I don‚Äôt think the Irish trust him one bit. The way he‚Äôs ‚Äòmoving us forward‚Äô is never going to work long term.
pro	I really hate the eu
pro	I really hate to say it, but it might be a good thing for the EU.
pro	I really hate to say it, but it might be a good thing for the EU. The EU needs serious reforms and it is impossible to reform anything when the UK just vetoes everything
pro	I really hate to say it, but it might be a good thing for the EU. The EU needs serious reforms and it is impossible to reform anything when the UK just vetoes everything.
pro	I really have concern about the mental health and thinking ability of remoaners. It‚Äôs like they are in a brain washed cult.
pro	I really hope people come to their senses and vote to leave. The EU is a straight jacket that is taking the very life-blood out of the nation states. It is an empire doomed to failure as it is built on idealism in that all member nations can be squeezed into the same mold, whereas nations need realism and the freedom to develop. All the UK really needs is being part of a free trade zone, nothing else as we can sort out all our own problems.
anti	I really hope the French are utterly merciless and make the Brits pay dearly out of the nose. Like fifty percent tariffs.
anti	I really hope the Queen steps in and fixes this. I know she does not want to do things like that, but she almost has to.
anti	I really hope they go downhill now
anti	I really really really hope we stay
anti	I really really wish we did not leave the EU. I would not be at all surprised if many people emigrated from the UK. This country's finished. People in this country are so selfish.
anti	I really think this European Union project is the greatest achievement for all people on this continent
anti	I really would like some politicians to be honest enough to say ‚ÄúYes, Brexit is really, really shitty, and we‚Äôre all going to suffer from it, but hey, you voted for it, so we‚Äôll do it anyway.‚Äù
pro	I really would like to see a no deal Brexit. Just to learn who was right. I really foresee UK economy getting crushed, but lets just wait and see and get ourselves some popcorn. Greetings from Europe.
anti	I realy wish that the EU would work, we need unity in Europe so that we can remain a powerful nation amongst China and the US
anti	I refuse to be discouraged. We can still stop Brexit. Let us have a second referendum. I know it is dangerous - but at least we will have tried to save our country from a deep and prolonged recession
anti	I remain unconvinced that a significant proportion of Leave voters will be happy with the eventual outcome.
anti	"I remember feeling shocked when I found out the result of the referendum. I didn't expect it at all. ""Why would you want to leave the EU? That's just a plain stupid thing to do. So arrogant to think you would be better off alone"" I thought."
anti	I reminded DUP that Brexit isn't cause for celebration,but means negative economic impacts
anti	I respect everyone‚Äôs opinion but I think we should stay! The people‚Äôs vote has been decided even if it was based on lies.
anti	I run an aircraft repair company. So I'm pissed off as I've had to move my base ops along with my family from UK to EU as the threat of restrictions on work, travel import, exports & visas as there's already people being given short Visa stays even though they've been in the UK paying well above average taxes for over 15yrs. So to all my Staff they feel uncertain as if there's any friction it'll cost money which equals jobs. Equally now I'm on the continent it's far easy to get around and now and have clients in countries that were put off before from the high pound value.
pro	I saw a video on facebook where an official guy claimed that leaving the EU meant leaving Europe altogether, which is BS. I saw another where an official warned that if we leave, the prices of all goods will go up, especially ice cream.
pro	I say Hard Brexit is the best. The EU is falling apart and never had the self interest of any of the members in mind to begin with.
anti	I say again: Why aren't the media hounding BoJo to #ReleaseRussiaReport ? #RejoinEU #DitchJohnson #Brexit
anti	I say give us a second referendum. Give us a chance to stop this nonsense.
pro	I say leave and get it over with. The majority (no matter how slim) voted to leave. So leave. Put on your boots and walk out. It's your country at stake you should worry about, not the rest of Europe.
anti	I say no to brexit. Are you listening Theresa?
pro	I say they should leave. The attitude of UK has always been of wanting the economic benefits with none of the responsibilities.
anti	I see British people as civilized and knowledgeable people, but how can they follow the mind of mentally disabled person like Boris Johnson?
anti	I see a bright future for GB... in the gutter!
pro	I see the EU is getting desperate, look anyone with half a brain knows Brexit is the best thing to happen to the UK, lies and misinformation will not change that
pro	I see the ilk of those who encouage EU membership, and know,out is the enlightened choice.
pro	I see the ‚Äòplanes are still flying. Local supermarket still full of food. Restaurants in post-Brexit London still packed on a Saturday night. Do you suppose the doom-mongers who said Leaving the EU would bring ruin are feeling just a little foolish?
pro	I seem to recall a certain little corporal, who had also over-run Europe, threatening us in 1939. Our response was two fingers. The same again is indicated now.  The Eurocrats are being sore losers, financially and emotionally, they are trying to control us - yet again - because they fear Great Britain succeeding, which it will, without their control and over-lordship. Where Britain leads - others will follow. Brexit lunch happening in Australia for us-expats at an English pub with proper English bitters. We shall be toasting our Independence Day. God Save The Queen, for nothing can save the EU!
anti	"I sense the column of ones that benefit is rather more limited in scope to the column for ones that won't: ""There will be an impact on business one way or the other, some will benefit, some won't,"" he told the paper."
anti	I seriously hope the UK does NOT LEAVE THE EU :( The fact that we're even having a vote makes me sad!
anti	I seriously think, brexiters may have some sort a brain damage from social media or smth to want such a thing.
pro	I shall be celebrating at 11pm. Bottle of English sparkling wine on chill already. I'm not young but, for the first time in my life, at 11pm tonight I will live in an independent, sovereign nation. So excited about it!
pro	I shall ease off my following of these comments forums as now Britain is legally out, the remaintards (now I know what that word means) will soon be the only ones left. The rest of us are focusing on the future.
anti	I shouldn‚Äôt laugh at our own misfortune, it will do neither myself or my own any good. I am so angry
anti	I sincerely hope EU workers in England and Wales will move to Scotland and help us in our bid for Independence from Westminster to secure our place in Europe.
anti	I sincerely hope that the UK will STAY in the EU in the future. As a european citizen I really believe we in the united EU countries make a stronger argument for trade and macro economics with the world like the united states of america. Together we ARE stronger.
anti	I smell war in a few years from now
pro	I spent a decade living in the remnants of the CCCP, the greatest failure in social engineering in history. I know exactly why I wanted a Brexit. The removal of a centralised, behemoth of a self serving bureacracy.
anti	"I stay European and I stand by the EU! A reason for me to say ""bye"" to a nationalist England!"
pro	I still believe brexit was the right choice, it's just I have no confidence of it ever being delivered. Nobody I know voted for more free trade and more immigration but that's what we're getting.
pro	I still believe it will be the best for the country in the long run. It's also interesting to see how the lies on both sides of the campaign are coming to light.
anti	I still can't believe how people voted to get out of the EU. Why you can't give a chance to the immigrants? Fucking dickheads #brexit
anti	I still can't take Brexit seriously. It's too stupid.
pro	I still don't regret voting to leave the European Union. Every time I see a politician whining, or trying to undo the vote it makes me even prouder to have voted Leave.
anti	I still don't understand what the Brexiters think they've 'won'. We lose our EU travel and voting rights, we lose access to EU medical care and we lose access to one of the biggest trading blocks in the world. Ordinary folk lose 'freedoms' and gain nothing. Brexit is a massive confidence trick played by the rich for their own benefit and it will be up to the next generation to clean up the mess!
anti	I still don't understand why people thought it was a good idea. It really does seem like those that voted had no idea what the EU does and what they were voting for.
anti	I still don't understand why the UK want's to leave the EU.
anti	I still strongly believe that UK is made up some of the most intelligent people on this planet. But how they got themselves into this mess is beyond me. The politicians that got them to vote for this nonsense will NEVER accept blame
anti	I still strongly believe that UK is made up some of the most intelligent people on this planet. But how they got themselves into this mess is beyond me. The politicians that got them to vote for this nonsense will NEVER accept blame. They'll just divert it elsewhere. And the average people on the streets are the ones that will suffer.
anti	I still suspect Brexit's going to be called off!
anti	I still think it'll all end in tears.
pro	I still want Full Fat Brexit !!!
pro	I still want out!
pro	I strongly believe EU will have a great future! The presence of the British with their selfishness and self-centeredness made the union weak and ineffective. Finally they are out!
pro	I strongly feel it would be a mistake to remain in the EU which is part of the Globalist architecture which will do nothing good for the working man in the UK.
pro	I suggest all remoaners go and live in Belgium .
pro	I support Boris 100%
pro	I support Brexit )
pro	I support Brexit and the UK can save high dues to the EU.
pro	I support Brexit because that is what they voted for. Will of the people.
pro	I support Brexit. Cannot happen soon enough
pro	I support brexit and why most people I know support brexit
pro	I support brexit because article 13 passed and I want my British memes
pro	I support brexit because it means indepdnece for Britain.
pro	I support the UK, I'll be rooting for them to succeed no matter where they go. On the flip side the rest of Europe is somewhat annoying and I just don't care what happens to the rest of the EU
pro	I supported Brexit and I support Scotish independence. Basically, I love the idea of secession. It should be done more often. I hope I live to see Hong Kong secede from China. I hope we see a US state (or three) successfully secede as well. These massive centralized world governments need to be broken up sooner, before we're all living under some tyrannical global dystopia.
pro	I suppose I should say that the politicians that pushed for no brexit should be put in jail, but I believe in democracy - you don't seem to understand the concept, you talk like a nazi.
pro	I suppose a big part that voted for leave voted because of uncontrollable immigration from 3rd world countries at the time. Even political campaign was all about this at the time and not about economy.
pro	I suppose that the good news is that NO older remain voters are dying off. Consequently the Remoaner vote will be in the majority. Yeah! Dream on. We‚Äôre leaving. Get over it. You pro EU lot are all the same. If you don‚Äôt like the result, keep voting until you get the result you want. It‚Äôs happening in Italy. The EU wanted to insert a pro EU Finance Minister but the Italians won‚Äôt have it. Now, another election. But this time the Italians will vote the same way as they have had enough of your beloved EU.
anti	I suppose the Brexit is to become indepent? So they gonna grow all the crops their selfs? What happens when Corona virus strikes there? Or do they somehow conjure a vaccine out of nowhere?
anti	I sure hope I am still alive to see Scotland and NI, as members of the EU but free from the current UK union, vote to block the prospects of a return to the EU by little Brexitland. Even if just for a little while for jokesies/revenge You may have shafted us with this ridiculous Brexit but we will have the last laugh
anti	I suspect cabinet ministers have to take an LQ test to see who are the best liars before they're allowed on TV. #BorisJohnson would no doubt top the poll. He's a Mensa level liar!
pro	I suspect it is not only the Brits who will soon be demanding the freedom to opt out.
anti	I suspect most of them don't really care what happens next and they are entirely unaccountable for their actions.
anti	I think #brexit and #VoteLeave is a mistake. We should stay in the #eu and reform. Calm heads needed #eureferendum
pro	I think Brexit is a chance for the UK. And you should proceed to leave on the 29th March. I even think a No-Deal-Brexit wouldn't be such a bad thing.
anti	I think Brexit is a disaster unfolding. Corporations control this world. It will get worse once we leave.
anti	I think Brexit is a mistake
anti	I think Brexit is an ill-informed decision that will damage the country long-term.
anti	I think Brexit is going to be the best example of why not to leave
pro	I think Brexit is good but am swayed by the biscuits argument.
pro	I think Brexit is good. We don't lose as much money. we can control over our laws, trade etc. Immigration control.
anti	I think Brexit is overall a bad idea, and the way it has been handled has made the situation even worse. However, a second referendum would not be a good idea. They don't work. We just got fucked by one. We elect governments with the intention that they will work on our behalf to do the best for the country. Stop letting us role the dice when we don't know best and it's not our job.
anti	I think Brexit is the most silly thing anyone could‚Äôve voted for
pro	I think De Gaulle was right when he did not allow Britain to be a member of the EEC.
pro	I think England should just rip the band-aid off and leave. It's a good move for them.
anti	I think I will move to Scotland and re-join EU. Let‚Äôs all do that!
pro	I think UK did a good job concerning Europe. Brexit was exactly the kick in the butt the EU needed. I hope the bureaucrats finally understood how dire the situation is, and that UK one day may join in again, when the EU has become a democratic institution.
anti	I think all of this is just a sick joke gone too far
anti	I think all of this is just a sick joke gone too far.
pro	I think classing those out voters as undereducated is a bit cheeky, I voted out and am by no means undereducated.
pro	"I think classing those out voters as undereducated is a bit cheeky, I voted out and am by no means undereducated.  Perhaps what they mean is that I was never exposed to the brainwashing propaganda such as the ""Erasmus"" programme and the pro eu propaganda blatantly practiced in modern UK universities.  Perhaps I have had time to watch the eu grow from a simple trading partnership into a political entity intent on creating a European state.  Perhaps I read a lot of books written from pro,neutral and anti eu standpoints.  Perhaps it is because I visited Brussels and watched and listened to the lobbyists in the bars and coffeshops.  Perhaps it is because my work means rubbing shoulders with many Europeans on their home turf.  Perhaps it is because I listened to them.  So yes,I am undereducated in that I have not studied a non subject like modern European art forms in a university in the last twenty years.  I should count myself lucky,and I do!"
anti	I think even the most ardent of Brexit voters would agree that whatever deal happens, the UK will face interim economic damage.
anti	I think everybody should have known what they were voting for, so after making your bed, it is time to sleep in it.
anti	I think getting leaving the EU is a bad idea. It also means less control, not more. All this is without mentioning the havoc that would ensue if, as the prime minister has threatened, we crash out of the EU without a deal as the prime minister has threatened.
anti	I think in the long run the UK will regret this decision, hopefully not tho.
anti	I think it is a very bad decision for the UK.
anti	I think it is a very bad decision for the UK. I have the feeling that this decision was made based on the nostalgia of the British Empire.
anti	I think it is a very bad decision for the UK. I have the feeling that this decision was made based on the nostalgia of the British Empire. The UK, strong, can rival anyone in the world by itself, so why would it surrender its sovereignty? Except that it's not the case anymore, as the great European nations of the 19th century (UK, France, Germany...) fell behind the behemoths that are China, the US... Unified, however, the EU is clearly top 3 in all matters, and best in some. Also, I am quite disgusted by the ton of disinformation we have seen during the campaign. UKIP is by no means better than Trump and is largely to blame for this folly.
pro	I think it is good the UK leaves as they were never that happy to be in the EU.
pro	I think it is great that Britain is following democracy and will be free. As a NZer I feel we are much closer culturally and historically to Australia, Samoa, Fiji, Tonga, PNG etc. than Britain is to many European countries, but I'd hate the thought of being joined politically. Freedom is more important than wealth.
pro	I think it should be fine. I‚Äôm leaning pro-brexit, but honestly they should just stop delaying shit.
pro	I think it should be recognized that Brexit was an amazing victory against massive odds by the ordinary people of the UK. Remember during the run up to the election the amount of Lovies and leaders who spoke for Remain. The whole of the British Liberal Elite, President of the USA, the Pope, the BBC, just about every actor and celebrity, and many many more. There followed three years of Brexiteers accused of not knowing what we voted for, brexiteers overnight became Bigoted fascist racist Little Englanders who had stolen their children's future and destroyed the Union. I feel so proud that we were so instrumental in defending democracy and becoming a Sovereign Nation again. Congratulations to all Brexiters.
anti	I think it was a poorly planned out plan that will harm England‚Äòs foreign relations.
anti	I think it will blow up in people‚Äôs faces, and I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs going to take to show people that the UK isn‚Äôt the ‚Äúpowerhouse‚Äù it was in the past, people need to be humbled..Brexit blowing up might just help with that.
pro	I think it will open many many doors. We can trade with whoever we want, however we want.
anti	I think it would be interesting to give people a sheet of paper with policies on it and ask people whether they think it's UK government policy or EU policy. See if people can tell what the EU actually does or if they still believe the lies told by Politicians and rag newspapers
anti	I think it's a mistake, esp economically
pro	I think it's a positive process that's going to work out for the UK.
anti	I think it's dumb.
anti	I think it's going to be bad very bad no one know what will happen
pro	I think it's great that Britain left the EU because the EU just look out for their selves and their own country
anti	I think it's only a matter of time before the best vote with their feet and move - to where I'm not sure given that the idiots have removed our freedom of movement. Tragic times ahead.
anti	I think it's stupid. It's a huge mistake. Both the UK and the EU are better off with each other than without
pro	I think it's the best decisions Britain has made in a long time
pro	I think it's time for the UK to prioritise it's citizens. What is the use of having your own Parliament if the EU will not respect or honour your country's law?
pro	I think it‚Äôs a great move, to be in control of your own country.
anti	I think it‚Äôs a terrible idea. Especially if it‚Äôs hard Brexit, from what I know it‚Äôs practically guaranteed to destroy the economy. It seems to be founded on a form of ultranationalism that attempts to justify that it‚Äôs okay to destroy your country in order to reject cultural pluralism.
pro	I think it‚Äôs going to be a success and glad we are leaving
anti	I think it‚Äôs the worst thing that will ever happen to this country. I think it‚Äôs absolutely disastrous,
pro	I think life will go on pretty much as before but with extra expense and hassle!
anti	"I think most of ppl in UK (not Scotish,i have to say that) are stupid (mostly old persons) because they dont understand what EU really is.It's easier way to transport goods,money,people and stop at this point because PEOPLE means a lot in UK,i mean they hate non-native persons like polish people (18 children in 18-20 age attacked adult 2 polish persons who talks to each other in polish and they was beated by them,was is dead and 1 is hospital,thank you so much for beeing tolerant :D).UK community doesnt understand that refugees will be always,that doesnt mean ""if UK leaves EU we wont have refugees :D"",IT DOESNT WORK LIKE THAT.I am done with people like them.Older people who are untolerant and dont understand what they did to whole Europe and their economy."
anti	I think most of us in Europe are hoping for a no-Brexit scenario.
anti	I think my dad is one of few older people I've spoken to that doesn't want to leave the EU. I'm proud.
anti	I think our own policies are far more damaging. Self imposed austerity. A government that only responds to one demographic. The eu was keeping those cunts in parliament in check. But I guess you're fine with having corporations fucking us over (and the richest of them already do, cos our government is as limp as a geriatric when it comes to tax from the big boys) . The supposed cut in red tape will be more, again benefiting the big multinationals rather than small independents. Prices are soaring. And yet our government still had its finger up its own arse. There are simple answers - scrap brexit, because it was an ill informed shit show of a referendum. But I guess you want less accountability and more power for an increasingly authoritarian government. Globalisation is here to stay. Brexit is not going to stop that. I would even argue that with a weakened government the big corps will be able to dictate even more. But that's OK for you as long as there is less Europeans on the street, serving you coffee, picking the harvest and generally contributing to society, while the majority of these half brained brits complain that washing dishes is beneath them. Fuck all of you brexiteer cunts to death, fuck you
pro	I think our stance on Brexit has perhaps been one of the most powerful things in helping people to recognise the values of the Liberal Democrats.
pro	I think people are starting to forget that that tiny island controlled almost all of the world at one point in history,leaving the failing EU will be seen as the greatest moments in British 21st century history.
pro	I think people of Europe should try their best to fix the EU before dismantling it, there are too many dangers for Europe if EU gets destroyed - large countries being able to easily bully us being one of them. UK should be allowed to fully leave though, they voted for it and it should be honored
pro	I think some of the Brexit people remember why we joined the EU in the first place. It was only for trade. Once we were in it started to turn political. This is not what we initially voted for. Pretend you are out of the EU now with free global trade (Europe included), we controll all our own laws and borders. Would you vote to join, knowing what you were going to give up control of? I certainly would not. Immigration is a MASSIVE issue. Actually what I am against is UNCONTROLLED immigration. This in itself causes some peoples blood to boil. And remember, there are ~50 countries in Europe, 28 of which are in the EU. All these countries trade with the EU just fine.
anti	I think that Boris Johnson is an imbecile, that Theresa May should have held a second referendum, that Article 50 should have stipulations added for requiring two public votes for exit to occur, and that Great Britain is looking like it's about to just be 'Britain' once again. Given how close the Scottish Independence vote was, back when Brexit was just an idea, I'm not surprised in the slightest that they've decided to hold a referendum once again, for the sake of remaining in the EU. One thing I seriously believe might be the only good solution for NI right now is for them to vote for their independence from the UK, however they should remain their own nation inside of the EU, free to make trade deals with England as they see fit. It'd be too much to ask them to formally be absorbed into the Republic of Ireland like Sinn F√©in has been pushing for decades. That's what I think is the only fair compromise that doesn't outright break the Good Friday agreement. Though the good Friday agreement doesn't specifically allow for NI to vote for complete independence of both parties, I would interpret a majority vote to leave the UK, and a vote to not unify would be valid under the agreement, I don't know too much about how strict or loose an interpretation of an agreement that old is allowed to be, so please correct me if I'm wrong about my interpretation.
anti	I think that Brexit is bad for the UK because if the UK left the customs union and the single market the British economy would be damaged significantly
anti	I think that Brexit is leading to impaired governance, social anxiety and squeezed living standards.
anti	I think that Brexit is not good for both the Britain and EU.
pro	I think that EU should not be all about Economy. The main problem with actual EU is that is an economic Giant and a political Dorf. It is very significative that precisely Great Britain, one of the first promotors of the idea of an Unified Europe, becames the first to leave the group. On the other side, I think Great Britain will continue to assume a preponderant role in World Econmy. Sorry, I havent been objective in the answer, but I think the main problem with EU is that economic issues always came first relatively to other signicant ones. I coul not help it!
anti	I think that brexiteers are wrong in what's going to happen.
pro	I think that's one reason why people who have personally watched it change from the EEC into what it is now are more likely to be leave voters.
pro	I think that, all considered, Brexit will be good for the EU.
pro	I think the British are so wise they leave while they still can.
anti	I think the British should be thankfull to the EU. Their own government is so useless, they can't agree upon anything.
anti	I think the British voters have absolutely been mis-led big time. Lies and false promises meant voters didn't really know what they were voting for.
anti	I think the British voters have absolutely been mis-led big time. Lies and false promises meant voters didn't really know what they were voting for. A lot of people don't even realise the meaning of brexit sadly yet it's such an important decision that will impact the future generations.
pro	I think the EU is structurally and economically unsound, utterly and completely resistant to change, lacking in transparency, possibly even corrupt, and ultimately will collapse.
anti	I think the EU is worth it but needs a lot of work
pro	I think the EU oversteps it's bounds a lot. The benefits of membership are pretty fixed, but the drawbacks ratchet up year by year.
anti	I think the UK is shooting itself in the face.
anti	I think the clusterfuck of the last 3-4 years is proof enough why they *shouldn't* be independent. But they made their made, time to sleep in it. And honestly, the Brits have been getting a little fucking uppity lately, so perhaps a nice humbling embarrassing experience is exactly what they need. In the end, I hope they come out OK. But I know in the interim they're in for a shitshow, and they have nobody to blame for that but themselves.
pro	I think the debate is over and Brexit done. We were sold that we could develop better overall trading structure without contributions and reduce immigration without harming economy and could break business free from unnecessary regulation. Tories have huge majority so no excuses not to deliver.
pro	I think the decision will be made around July. I don't think it will go the distance if the EU continue to act as children. Too many jobs are dependent on the EU member state's biggest single market - the UK. The 27 will be experiencing a lot of pressure from their businesses to get a deal done.
anti	I think the first thing we'll see after Brexit is the exodus of young and bright talent from London to major European cities like Paris, Amsterdam or Berlin.
pro	I think the idea is that we will have to conform to less EU laws
pro	I think the majority of Brits care and will vote to leave they are seeing through the rhetoric.
pro	I think the point about this referendum that terrifies a lot of people is that it is the Elite (in) vs the people (out). The Elite controls the political agenda which creates a lot of frustration for lesser mortals who can't find a voice.
pro	I think the remainers, and EU lovers just using scare tactics. I have full faith in Brexit and we all need to unite as one and build a better future for are country.
pro	I think the sooner we are out of the EU the better.
anti	I think the stupid people who were pro brexit but ill informed have got bored of the whole Brexit thing and gone back to playing darts in the boozer.
anti	I think the stupid people who were pro brexit but ill informed have got bored of the whole Brexit thing and gone back to playing darts in the boozer. The people that are still shocked we would do something as stupid as leave the EU have become the dominant voice... Well outside of the news entertainment channels.
anti	I think this is the biggest blunder in UK‚Äôs history for a very, very long time.
pro	I think this seems totally like a good idea. After Brexit we‚Äôll have taken back control of our waters and stuff.
pro	I think this sums up just how out of touch the liberal left are with real people, the sooner we are out the better.
pro	I think we can learn a lot from the Brexit by watching it unfold. If it is a positive effect for their country, I believe the US should follow them by leaving the Chinese union.
anti	I think we have embarrassed ourselves and that whatever the outcome, this country is going to be a less pleasant one.
anti	I think we knew from day one that brexit is all about blaming immigrants for everything. Tragic nonsense - if you want to blame anybody for the deficiencies in your life you should start with the tories, thatcher and neoliberalism.
pro	I think we will hugely thrive outside the EU. it will be a painfull adjustment but one worth taking
anti	I think we will regret leaving the EU, good on Scotland for keeping the EU flag flying. You go go for independence, good luck to you as a country with foresight and common sense,
pro	I think weve subsidised the poorer countries of the EU for long enough. Time to put our own people first!
anti	I think we‚Äôll live to regret it in a few years‚Äô time. They‚Äôre (the EU is) our closest neighbors so we want to get closer to them, not further away from them, it‚Äôs just common sense,
anti	I though that #Brexit was going to mean more control of borders. Now it turns out that #Brexit will be less control of our borders and a security risk. #PeoplesVote
anti	"I thought Boris ""dead in a ditch but rose from the dead"" is the Superhero. Enlight me."
anti	I thought about 'giving up'. The battle is still very much on. Bozo is looking like trying to deliver some abomination of brexit that nobody voted for. I think we're going to need protests.
pro	I thought it was going to boost support for independence in Scotland, but the polls haven't really shown that, which is disheartening. Maybe the exit will have to actually go through first. As it happens I'm going to be studying abroad at Edinburgh next semester, so I'll be right in the thick of it.
anti	I thought that the EU was reformable, UK sovereignty unimportant, and that I would be better off in.
anti	I thought the leavers thought it undemocratic to keep voting on something until you get the result you want? Odd.
pro	I tormented myself over whether voting for Brexit was the right thing to do. I have grandchildren. Now, more than ever, I would vote Leave. To remain scares me almost as much as Jeremy Corbyn!
anti	I totally agree with all the points made in the article, but Simon Jenkins ultimately falls into the trap of referring to this as a 'divorce'. I've never seen a couple where one member is six times bigger than the other. As his own arguments make clear, it's just ridiculous to claim that this is a relationship between equals. But the Brexit propaganda seems to be doing a good job (again) in spreading this lie.
pro	I totally agree with the comments made by the PM and fully support his stance. The EU must never ever be able to rule the UK again whatever the cost. UK will not be over-ruled by this bunch. You want a fight then you can have it. Be carefull what you wish for.
anti	I truelly believe that EU can do things that Nato cannot. #NoBrexit
pro	I truely wish to leave, preferably today!
anti	I trust the EU, I do not trust Johnson!
anti	"I understand half of the voters opted for ""leave"" but almost half of them didn't. If Theresa May wants to talk about the ""will of the people"" and ""doing it for the people"" then how does she explain ignoring the many people in her country who are not happy with her approach? I cannot imagine what it feels like when the government pretends you don't even exist."
anti	I understand patriotism and love for ones home, but the Brexit is bad for the EU but devastating for the UK. Citizens need to listen to professionals on this matter not their emotions.
anti	I understand that people want change but reacting to fear by cutting ourselves off from the rest of the world will only make it worse.
pro	I understand the rationale for EU membership if you are one of the countries receiving charity, but it's a shame the French and Germans don't have the balls to stand up and insist on a referendum, polls have shown their ordinary hard working people would vote leave in bigger numbers that the UK
anti	I understand what y'all are saying, but at the same time it's so handy to have the EU.. so easy to travel between the countries in it and i know so many people who managed to get european fonds for their business and ideas.. that's kinda hard to give up when you're already used to the bad parts and enjoing the good ones (that's why, i think, so many of us, europeans, see the EU as a great thing)
pro	I used to be against Brexit but now I'm for it.
pro	I used to be pro Europe but Greece has caused me to rethink my position. Unrestrained German Mercantilism is not how the EU is supposed to operate - better to get out now before it disintegrates.
pro	I used to be pro-EU, then I realised what a fool I had been.
anti	I used to feel rage, but I just can't sustain it for three years and I've got other things to concentrate on, so now I feel resignation, exasperation, weariness.....You could call it Brexit Burnout, I guess.
pro	I used to love Corsica and Italy,ruined by the EU.Salvini trying to keep Italy Italian.
anti	I used to think that brexiters generally were despicable, semi-literate, socially dysfunctional xenophobes with no grasp of economic reality and with little understanding of the fundamentals of a parliamentary democracy. Now I just think they're just sad and delusional, and blissfully unaware of the tsunami of ordure coming their way.
pro	I used to vote Labour, i will not vote for Labour they backed Remain I would rather vote UKIP as they backed Leave.
pro	I value my nations independence and achievements and believe this will be seriously and irrevocably crippled by becoming just another cog in another superpowers arsenal.
pro	I value these opinions, but I still think if the cup of tea wants the tea bag to remain, it needs to let the tea bag call its own shots on matters like border security and immigration
pro	I vote out b/c I want England to be for the English, simple as that.
anti	I vote remain.
anti	I vote remain. When people have to pay huge fees for nannies, cleaners and builders they will realise how idiotic their vote to leave was. #lovecheapbritain
pro	I voted Brexit because of O'Brien.
pro	I voted Leave (and would do so again)
pro	I voted Leave Best decision I have ever made in my lifetime At 11pm we are OUT FREEDOM!
pro	I voted Leave because I am a socialist Old Labour man.
pro	I voted Leave because I am a socialist Old Labour man. The EU is an organisation devoted to taking power away from the accountable level, the national government, so it can be exercised on behalf of big business.
pro	I voted Leave because I don't want to be part of the United States of America, any more than the United States of Europe.
pro	I voted Leave but had to think long and hard about it, now, absolutely leave, 100%
anti	I voted Leave during the referendum, and whilst I stand by my reasons for this initial vote, I came to change my view over the course of the absolute nightmare that has been Brexit.
pro	I voted Leave to restore our independence and freedom after 43 years of control
pro	I voted Leave, I consider myself a centrist. Happy today
pro	I voted Leave, and would do so again. I believe the UK is better off outside the political institution that is the EU. But better off has many meanings, for me its a mixture of political, social, and economic issues, whereas most these days seem to be solely fixed on the economic aspects.
pro	I voted Leave. I don‚Äôt want the country my family died fighting for to be controlled by the countries that surrendered or tried to occupy us. If you want further European cooperation then I‚Äôm open to it, but under British dominance and not German. Nothing the EU provides could not also happen without the EU and with simple agreements between nations. It is a trade protection bloc, nothing more.
pro	I voted OUT of the EU. I would vote out AGAIN and AGAIN and again and again and again and again and again. No one ever asked me if I wanted to join the EU.
pro	I voted OUT.
anti	I voted Remain, not just for political reasons but because my mum‚Äôs moved to Spain and I want her to stay there.
anti	I voted Tory all my life. I never will again. They will take us to destruction of the economy because of their own desires to lead their party. When this hurts the poorest and the economy is reduced I will not forgive them for hurting the poorest more even if the poorest may well have voted for it on a campaign of what i believe were lies and false promises.
anti	I voted against brexit and haven't changed my views. I also to take into account that 17 million people voted for brexit. Changing the decision of a mojority of voters now would most likely only make matters among the British population, which is already in a bad way. Safe to say, no matter what happens, its going to be one hell of a shit show.
pro	I voted brexit I don't want to be told what to do by another country I don't have a problem with foreigners coming into this country to work and let's face it they are keeping this country moving why you like it or not
pro	I voted brexit and will NEVER EVER regret it. Brexit will give us back our right to rule our country the way WE see fit.
pro	I voted brexit, because of the lies about funding for the NHS. I'm a mental health advocate, and everytime the NHS does budget cuts, they take it out of the mental health system
pro	I voted for Brexit ... and you sound like a remoaner!
pro	"I voted for Brexit in 2016, and would vote for it again today, if ever they held a second referendum. If anything, the events that have unfurled since 2016 - the EU trying to ""punish"" Britain as an example to others, showing that the club they pretend is so wonderful is actually Hotel California - have confirmed my long held view that EU = totalitarianism soft. Go away, Mr. Macron, your people hate you."
anti	I voted for Brexit ‚Äì and now I realise what a terrible mistake I made
pro	I voted for Brexit, and did so with the expectation that there would be a short-term economic downturn as a result. Why would I do such a thing? Perhaps because I weighed up the options and realised that the best plan in the long-term would be to leave. Are you aware of any of the democratic and economic issues that leave voters voted on?
pro	I voted for Brexit, as did most people I know. Would you like to know some legitimate reasons why people votes for Brexit? 17.4 million people voted, it isn't because we're all stupid or want to harm ourselves.
pro	I voted for Brexit, but I have no qualms with a powerful, federal EU. I'd much rather they be the most powerful economy in the world than China, or India.
pro	I voted for Brexit. I'm not die hard passionate about it. However I am very anti globalist so I am pleased to decentralise unelected power.
pro	I voted for Brexit. What it is with me, I‚Äôd rather be a poor master than a rich servant. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt about the racism, immigrants or anything, it was about freedom.
pro	I voted for a NO DEAL BREXIT.............. Did YOU?
pro	I voted for a fair immigration policy. My wife is a non-EU citizen from Thailand and we are discriminated against. If I didn‚Äôt earn ¬£20,000 or more ‚Äì the required figure ‚Äì the choice would be to claim benefits and then when it came to my wife‚Äôs visa renewal she would have to leave. Her visa costs almost ¬£1,500 every every two-and-a-half years. Cameron has only himself to blame. He thought he could bully the electorate, the same as in the Scotland referendum, but forgot that nobody is enthused or patriotic about the EU and millions hate him. I also don‚Äôt like to be told by governments and businesses how to vote, that‚Äôs why we have a secret vote. There‚Äôs a lot of anger against Cameron. I think any xenophobia and racism is stirred up more by the remain side, not the leave side. I am very much in favour of a fair immigration policy. The Australian points system was a big deciding factor for me. I‚Äôm not sure if it would be any easier for my wife under the points system. Depends on the level, but I would hope as a British citizen I wouldn‚Äôt be discriminated against. I‚Äôm very happy with the result, it should keep all of them occupied for years and less time to start picking fights around the world.
pro	I voted for brexit for various reasons but the main reason is the lack of transparency in the EU.Most people I know cannot name even one MEP .
pro	I voted for it because it was the right thing to do.
pro	I voted for it because it was the right thing to do. Doesn't personally benefit me.
pro	I voted for one of the options given, to leave, not hang around waiting until the EU decides to give us a really bad deal.
anti	I voted for remain, as did all of my family and friends and everyone I have asked. I don't understand it. Who are the people who voted to leave? And what do they want? The leave voters they have shown on TV only say catch phrases about immigration, like that guy on channel 4 news last night. But that is so crazy. Now we are out of the EU, what incentive does France have to detain illegal immigrants at Calais for us? I know lots of people who are overjoyed with this result. My Chinese friends studying in London are celebrating the lowered exchange rate, and their parents are waiting for the fire sale of British assets. My investment firm friends are too busy making money from this new crisis. But I am not happy about it. I am sitting here feeling very sad that this is possibly the end of the country I love. The United Kingdoms of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
pro	"I voted leave and I would still vote leave if given the choice. Before you lot jump to the same argument i always see on the sub reddit Immigration was never a key point for me and I would happily accept free movement and even free trade with the EU (which was the agreement under the EEC long before Orwell's nightmare existed). I would also be happy finding it. After all what is a few million to a great trade deal and happy more stable neighbours. However I despise the way the EU is ran and there is no way for it to be reformed other than 27 countries seemingly agreeing to change it which will never happen as there will always be one or two who will vote against change for their own personal gain. In the mean time we all have to deal with an unelected President and commission (who control all the power) and a parliament that acts as a smoke screen. It genuinely makes me sad that we live in a country where so many want to willingly abandon the democracy we fought so hard for in exchange for trinkets. As far as what I think of this new deal I despise that to and I believe this was our Prime ministers plan all along to give us a terrible deal and say ""it's this or no brexit"". So you lot may well get your dictatorship after all and I hope it's worth selling what little freedoms we have left to our multinational overlords. This is truly what it felt like to be a roman after the fall"
anti	I voted leave and deeply regret it. What have I done to my country? I was influenced by lies and illegally bought Facebook ads. I didn't do any research about what Brexit would mean.
anti	I voted leave and do regret it now. I now think its a fucking stupid idea.
pro	I voted leave and don't like either labour or the tories. I can't see workers rights being eroded like some are claiming. Any party that tries to get rid of maternity leave, sick pay, holidays etc will be fucked in any future election
pro	I voted leave and i can assure you it's not all about immigration. I love Europe and european people, it's just that our democratic rights are completely drowned out in the EU in favour of large businesses and a collectivised economy.
anti	I voted leave and now have changed my mind.
anti	I voted leave and now have changed my mind. It was a stupid choice. New referendum is needed
pro	I voted leave and proud!
pro	I voted leave and would again A leave vote means more chance of Scottish independence, at which point Scotland can join the EEU & Schengen
pro	I voted leave because I think that large, all-encompassing systems of government are dangerous.
pro	I voted leave because I wanted my country to be able to govern itself and look after it's own interests.
pro	I voted leave because I wanted my country to be able to govern itself and look after it's own interests. I do not want a democratically deficient, unaccountable, unaudited and unelected foreign institution to make decisions for me and my country. Brexit is happening and I see hope and prosperity for myself and for my fellow British citizens
pro	I voted leave because the EU has become corrupt and unaccountable and does not serve the people.
pro	I voted leave because the EU is going to collapse, their trade laws are problematic for the UK, their immigration policy causes many problems, so on
pro	I voted leave but I didn‚Äôt really want to leave Europe
pro	I voted leave but surely that post was a joke. If not I can only assume a trained gorilla has acquired keyboard skills. I am ashamed to be associated with such utter tripe. Giving leave voters a bad name and fuelling leaves ammo, muppet.
pro	I voted leave for all these reasons. Hopefully now we have a new government we can make Great Britain great again. üá¨üáßüá¨üáß
pro	I voted leave meaning clean break out of europe totally. No deal and keep your grubby hands off the British tax payers 39 billion.
pro	I voted leave that meant leave!!!!!!!
pro	"I voted leave, and it wasn't because of ""immigration"" or because i am ""uneducated"" or ""racist"". I want the EU countries to get better and stronger there shouldn't be a reason to leave your home country, your country is to provide for you, that's jobs healthcare, education, and a home if one of these things is the reason you have to leave then there's a problem, and its with your own country that things needs to change. Using the British or any other nations tax payers money is shameful. I know i said immigration wasn't the reason i voted leave but the people who come here for work thinking its a good thing are wrong if you have too immigrate here just to get a job then your home country has let you down and NEEDS TO CHANGE! Britain and its money wont help change the core problem which is too many EU countries cant provide for there populace and use the free movement of people to pass the problem to others like the UK and Germany, France. I voted leave to make the country's in the EU stronger because hanging on another nations apron strings isn't the way to go."
pro	I voted leave, i couldn't give a f..k what rich people think. Just get on with it !!!!
pro	I voted leave. Everything you're talking is rubbish.
pro	I voted leave. I am a migrant to the UK from outside the EU. My parents worked hard all their lives here, and we are happy as a family here. We never claimed benefits, and we have paid taxes and contributed to our local communities. I ended up marrying a foreign woman outside the EU and went through a challenging process to get my wife a VISA. All other migrants should be prepared to do the same, and not treat the UK as a transitional home. The government and it's people have the right (and a duty, God forbid), to put it's own interests at it's forefront - I fail to see why this is even an issue? This time democracy won - and people continue to complain? Why?
pro	I voted leave. I wish I had put a bet on the result. I believe the odds for leaving at 10pm on the night was something like 8 to 1 or something around that figure
pro	I voted leave. It has nothing at all to do with immigration. I love Europe, but the EU has done it's job. now it has become an undemocratic, bloated beurocracy and it no longer acts in British national interests. I have lived in the far east for a large part of my life and spent a large chunk of my time in the USA and south America. We do not need to be chained to an Eurocentric attitude to trade and relations. We are not turning our back on the EU, we are opening the doors to the rest of the world and we are doing it on OUR terms, not the EU's.
pro	I voted out ,I win u lose..
pro	I voted out, knew exactly what I voted for and have had zero regrets voting leave!! Utter horseshit that leave voters regretted their vote. Total bollocks.
anti	I voted reject Brexit. I am a British national living in Spain, the EU has been hugely beneficial to me.
anti	I voted remain (in a heartbeat, easy choice) and would always do so again. I do have valid gripes against some stuff the EU does, and there are issues that may never really be resolved (common agriculture policy/fisheries policy etc). At the same time the EU is our biggest trading partner, we work incredibly closely with EU countries in a variety of things (science etc, the arts) and all this is now in danger.
anti	I voted remain (in a heartbeat, easy choice) and would always do so again. I do have valid gripes against some stuff the EU does, and there are issues that may never really be resolved (common agriculture policy/fisheries policy etc). At the same time the EU is our biggest trading partner, we work incredibly closely with EU countries in a variety of things (science etc, the arts) and all this is now in danger. At least one preferred option for trade after brexit would cost businesses here more than we used to pay the EU (by multiple billions, based on estimates) Thanks to the leave vote the economy is now doing less good than it was, the military is even more underfunded due to the exchange rate crashing, xenophobic and racist attacks saw a huge surge after the vote as well. Basically every week is another bad bit of news about something we are losing, something damaging our country and something going wrong, as a result of Brexit and voting to leave. NHS recruitment is a big one. We are now looking at probably decades of austerity, and once we actually leave, it will likely get pretty shitty. As it is, things are not too bad yet because it is a long gradual process. Thus far, there hasn't been any real positive news at all out of this whole debacle.
anti	I voted remain and I regret the over all vote, but this video is ridiculous..
anti	I voted remain and if we were to have a second referendum I would vote remain again. However, what happens if we lost again? The people's vote campaign looks awfully similar to the first time round. Wealthy individuals and middle-class students making a lot of noise in the major cities whilst willfully ignoring the concerns of those outside of London, Manchester, Liverpool etc.
anti	I voted remain as I used to live on the continent. Concessions for Cameron would have avoided all of this. Learn your lessons EU. Dont treat member states as your property and listen to the people not corporations.
anti	I voted remain but I can see how the EU has a serious democratic deficit and that is unsustainable and they are not planning to change.
anti	I voted remain but feel that in the right hands Brexit could have worked. It was hijacked by Mr Johnson: a career opportunist and fantasist - and a dangerous one at that. The issue for me was why people voted in the first place to leave and suggest it was because people outside London felt they were being ignored and due to the lack of real info. at the time voted for their own visions of Brexit.
pro	I voted remain but having watched how bitter and twisted the E.U. have treated Great Britain the quicker we are to leave, the happier I will be.
anti	I voted remain but most people I know who voted leave did so because of concerns about the unelected officials in the EU having increasingly influence over the UK.
anti	I voted remain but most people I know who voted leave did so because of concerns about the unelected officials in the EU having increasingly influence over the UK. I might not agree with it but it‚Äôs silly to dismiss half the country as stupid and racist.
anti	I voted remain but respect the views of the those who voted leave. To call people racist just because they wanted to leave the EU is not only wrong but insulting.
pro	I voted remain but would now vote leave.
anti	I voted remain in the referendum because i believed all of this mess should have been delt with first.
anti	I voted remain today... United we stand, divided we fall.
anti	I voted remain, and if I had a chance again would vote remain again !!!.
anti	I voted remain, but London will remain a world financial centre whatever happens.
anti	I voted remain, but if I had voted leave then I would be all wrapped up in the sovereignty nonsense, and I would be pretty disappointed. Or the other one they all deny is that they simply don‚Äôt like foreigners, well I would have mixed feeling there, they certainly were successful in reducing the number of doctors, nurses, health professionals coming to work in our National Health service.
anti	I voted remain, love Europe and its people
anti	I voted remain, was disappointed at the result, but over the past 3 and a half years became fed up with people who tried to subvert the democratic wishes of the majority.
anti	I voted remain.
anti	I voted remain...
pro	I voted to LEAVE. Did I vote to deal? No! No! No!
pro	I voted to kick out immigrants so the rich have to pay real wages
pro	I voted to leave
pro	I voted to leave as did the majority but the London centric establishment
pro	I voted to leave because I am pro democracy, that has not changed.
pro	I voted to leave because I the voter and taxpayer have no democratic control over the machinations of the Commission
pro	I voted to leave because QMV is undemocratic and that since 2009 any decision against the EUs‚Äô agenda to consolidate its own power and to increase federalisation fails because of QMV. Britain doesn‚Äôt want a closer federalised union, the EU does, these are two irreconcilable viewpoints. But hey ho, it's much easier just to call me a stupid uneducated racist right.
pro	I voted to leave because open door immigration is irresponsible when a country that Housing, Hospitals,Doctors and many other services are struggling to cope. I don't have any problem with anybody from the EU or any other country coming to the UK but the numbers need to be controlled so public services are not overwhelmed. While clueless politicians put whats best for the EU before the UK
pro	I voted to leave for a few reasons. As far as I know, the UK pays more money to the EU than what it gets back. So basically if you give your friend ¬£50 a week, they only give you ¬£40 in return (this isn't accurate, it is for arguements sake) which should be a good enough reason to want to leave. Also I feel Britain can be prosperous outside of the EU, we should be allowed to make and abide by our own laws. I feel that many of the other stronger countries in the EU will follow suit in the next decade.
pro	I voted to leave purely because of sovereignty.
pro	I voted to leave the EU because I want the British economy to collapse :)
pro	I voted to leave the EU. I rejected a supranational government. What would it take you to understand the danger to democracy the EU represents
pro	I voted to leave this EU train. It was meant purely as a trading union. Nothing else. It is becoming the soviet union in Western guise and I do not want it. I do not want any laws coming from Brussels. That and the EU has pretty much gutted countries like Greece. Nobody would invite an stranger into your home without some kind of assessment of the person you invite in. Not because you are racist which seems to be the go to argument because leftists cannot seem to engage in sensible conversation. I want people assessed prior to entry. Because I give a dam about those living within. One of the many reasons the UK is now in such a state is that we have had such an influx of migrants that we now do not have the infrastructure to deal with it. We have an incredible housing shortage, our schools are pretty much full and the the NHS is on the verge of crumbling because it simply cannot cope anymore. If you really want to move to a different country is it really that much trouble applying for a visa and being checked to ensure you are not a danger to the populous? I personally don't think so. You should always be in driving seat of your own destiny. The Americans fight for independence against the British was not much different. Any American wish to be governed by the UK? Would be the same for India. The EU is nothing more than empire. And every empire in history has failed, and for good reason.
anti	I voted to leave,and I regret that‚Ä¶
anti	I voted to remain in the EU. There were never any benefits to Brexit which weren‚Äôt massively outweighed by the downsides, even if we‚Äôd had a competent government to take us through the negotiations.
anti	I voted to remain... because I'm NOT a racist.
anti	I voted to stay
anti	I voted to stay because I knew brexit was going nowhere from the get go
pro	I voted to stay now I know more I wish I would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve voted to leave
pro	I voted to support the UK fishing industry as UK fisherman are only allocated 30% of the quota for fishing in their own territorial waters. Hopefully all UK jobs, businesses and perhaps companies will now stop importing goods and food that could be bought in the UK, in turn supporting UK industry and creating jobs. Perhaps we will eventually start producing world class cars and machinery again, because all of that‚Äôs gone tits up since joining the EU with all the rules and regulations. The EU is failing. The euro is collapsing, and the whole EU is going backwards while the rest of the world overtakes. I am not a Nazi racist and have no problem with immigration or free movement of people. I do, however, have a problem with immigrants being able to claim child support for children that don‚Äôt live in the UK. I don‚Äôt agree with the remain campaign‚Äôs false statistics, blocking fishermen‚Äôs protests in the Thames, and shouting abuse at working class men just trying to provide for their families and general sneakily hidden foul play. Truthfully none of my friends or colleagues are having second thoughts either, everyone here is happy. We knew the pound would temporarily fall, and knew the euro would too. I also know the pound will recover, more than recover in fact. Not sure if the euro will recover. Maybe we were never stronger in Europe, but Europe was stronger with us. I hope the media will start giving all the facts, not just the scaremongering ones. I hope for the success of the working man and UK businesses, not just multinational businesses, millionaires or the upper class who make all their money from investment banking.
anti	I wait to see how many work dodgers will come off benefits to fruit pick or dig up potatoes in all weathers then!!
anti	I wanna stay in the EU
anti	I wanna stay in the EU üò≠üò≠üò≠
pro	I want Brexit, the british people would be saved from article 13
pro	I want UK to be a democratic global trading nation instead of being tied to decaying and undemocratic EU
pro	I want UK to be independent and NOT a EU' province !!
pro	I want a hard border at Dover to keep the EU out of GREAT BRITAIN
pro	I want a stable country where people from all counties across the UK are heard and not fed scraps from the south. I don‚Äôt want to fear that when my daughter has children there‚Äôs no room in schools due to overcrowding, or if she has health issues a medical appointment doesn‚Äôt take longer than growing a baby. We should feel safe in our jobs and not feel as though if we‚Äôre not willing to work seven days a week, 10 hours a day then someone can quite easily be drafted in from abroad and subsequently thrown on the unemployment pile further straining local economy. When every Briton lives a suitable standard of life, then my tax money can be spent elsewhere. When the systems put into place ‚Äì NHS, state schools, housing ‚Äì are well-equipped and capable of looking after each individual residing in the UK, then we can accept more and do right by others. We, the little people, or even the big boys that apparently run the country haven‚Äôt got full control over what happens, and if suffering a downturn in wages due a weaker economy over trading deals is a price to pay to make the country and its people better educated and in a full bill of health then so be it. The image of racism is far from true and shouldn‚Äôt be used as a smear against the voiceless that live day-to-day with the consequences of the decision makers that reside in a London borough away from real life and constantly roll the shit downhill. What the writers in a swanky London office or sat at home at a fine oak table with an Apple Mac drinking espresso from Starbucks don‚Äôt realise is that the leave voters from wherever they‚Äôre from aren‚Äôt afraid of rolling up their sleeves and putting in the graft that will make the country great.
pro	I want an independent country!
pro	I want ano deal brexit as a total break is what I voted for
pro	I want ano deal brexit as a total break is what I voted for !
pro	I want hard brexit and then we can invest that 39 billion into our own car factories, plane factories etc. The government should provide OUR people with tax free loans to start up new enterprise ! We want NO DEAL !!!
pro	I want my Country back
pro	I want our laws to be decided in Westminster not Brussels
anti	I want the UK to STAY in the EU
pro	I want the UK to make it's own laws
anti	I want the UK to stay in European Union forever...
pro	I want the laws that we are governed by in Britain to be made in Britain & to be made by people who can be held to account by the British electorate
anti	I want to be with EU
pro	I want to leave because: 1. the EU is fundamentally undemocratic - only the unelected commission can propose laws, the parliament is a mere amending chamber - there is no true separation of legislature and executive. How many years did it take for us to secure universal suffrage and its now being destroyed under our noses without people realising what is going on. 2. the vast majority of our laws are now made by the EU, and they are now unashamedly pressing on with an EU army - ie. we aint seen nothing yet 3. The EU is controlled by big business, big banks, Soros etc- its run by the establishment for their own benefit, the people no longer count - look at the tricks that are being played out now as the will of the people is regarded with contempt as it does not fit in with the establishment line 4. 20 billion quid a year to pay for this when an increasing number rely on foodbanks and essential services are still being cut. 5. The Euro has crippled most of southern Europe and is stopping the richer members from developing economically 6. Our country is being subsumed into this dysfunctional superstate when it could be a leading player in world trade 7. Open-door policy has led to a flooding of the lower paid labour market with a resulting compression of wages
pro	I want to leave the EU so Britain can rule Britain again.
pro	I want to leave the EU. I just don't like being part of it. Its not based on economic studies, immigration or anything like that. I just don't want to be part of it the same way i prefer Rugby to Football. Why do we need to have such complex arguments for these things. I want Great Britain to be truly independent, then i want a real trail blazer of a party leader to win the next election and i want this mess of a country sorted out once and for all. Seriously, whats so wrong with just going it alone? Treat the country like a startup....great things could happen.
pro	"I want to leave, not because im anywhere close to the right or because i hate europe, cause i dont. its actually because i feel the EU is a twisted state thats lied to us and is set to become the next fascist state, if america doesnt. it was promised to be the holy economic union that would ""make europe great again"" and instead its a political union that controls courts and parliaments and im not allowed to vote in anyway on how its run, where its run or its primary objectives. it controls me and my country in ways i deem unacceptable and this is the only way i could change it."
pro	I want to save our country from becoming part of a united States of Europe, don't believe me read the treaties.
pro	I want to see an end to the corrupt EU Dictatorship, No Deal will hit the destruct button for them.
pro	"I want to see the EU project fall apart. It does more harm than good, it won't be reformed, it's not democratic and it has frankly been a sinking ship for a while now. The last time there were bailouts, it was widely acknowledged that future bailouts were inevitable and all they served to do was kick the can down the road for a eurozone that is fundamentally flawed. Almost every beneficial agreement from being inside the EU can and will most likely remain in place. The difference is now we can act in our own self interest. As an example, switzerland is outside the EU but is part of the single market, one of the stipulations being free movement of people. However, when there was the migrant crisis they simply said ""fuck it"" and closed their borders. Many other European countries wished they could have done the same but simply lacked the freedom to do so. I would go as far as to say the average British person does not think Multi-culturalism is a good thing or that what people call ""isolationism"" is a bad thing. This is different from racism but the left will paint it however they will. A 2013 poll by British Social Attitudes said 77% of voters endorsed reducing immigration. If the left wants to label 77% of the British public as ignorant racists they can go right ahead."
pro	I want to set Great Britain free and lets start trading with the other 85 Countries and be proud to leave the EUROPE BEHIND.
anti	I want to stay in EU to help keep peace in Europe.
anti	I want to stay in the EU because I don't want to see those jobs go..and the workers being left in the same state we were.
anti	I want to stay in the EU.
pro	I want us to make our own decisions. Europe is a mess. Let's fix ourselves by ourselves
pro	I wanted out of the European Union because I knew it would be best for how I wanted Britain.
pro	I wanted the UK to leave the EU
anti	I wanted to stay
anti	I wanted to stay :(
pro	I wanted to stay in the EU. But I voted to leave. He depicts those who voted leave to be old, xenophobic, less educated and nationalists. All my family are Irish including myself and I also have a BSc (hons) degree and I love to travel around the world where I enjoy meeting and speaking to others. I also have dated other ethnic people. So how do I fit into your bullshit narrative.
anti	I wanted to stay in the European Union
pro	I was 20 when I voted to leave and I have no regrets. I want us to be able to have our self determination as a people and stop the EU, a state too impoverished to pay it's own debts but brand us British as criminals for wanting to rule ourselves. The sooner we leave the EU the better. Hopefully then we can have freer, fairer trade with every nation in the world.
pro	I was 22 when I voted for brexit now I'm 23 and I will still vote for brexit.
anti	I was 60-40 in favour of Remain. After Boris Johnson's ridiculous outburst comparing the EU to Hitler I'm now 100% #VoteStay #EUref
pro	I was Leave then and I‚Äôm leave now VOTE LEAVE üá¨üáß
anti	I was Remain for a long while, then for a minute or two I teased with Leave before snapping myself out of it. I'm sure that the EU might be weaker without the UK, but the UK would definitely be weaker without the EU.
anti	I was a member of the Conservative Party. I campaigned in past for it. After this I will never vote Conservative again. Brexit is nothing other than economic suicide which will only benefit the mega rich like Rees Mogg, Murdoch etc..
anti	I was absolutely gutted by the result. I still feel we should have remained in. However, it's vital that the British people unite to make a success of this. There are definitely opportunities and if 48% of the population stand around whinging we won't have a chance of making this work for us
pro	I was always confident LEAVE would win, but after the main tv debate where Sturgeon, Rudd and Eagle were such a car crash, then I knew leave would win.
anti	I was born an EU citizen and have enjoyed the freedoms and privileges it brought. It's all been taken away from me, and from all the other British citizens who didn't just stay in their lounges reading the Daily Mail.
pro	I was completely for BREXIT. In fact, I would be happy if Germany pulled out of the European Union and stood on her own feet. Being economically the most powerful country in Europe, why should the Germans who worked hard to attain this status share their wealth.
anti	"I was completely shocked by the Brexit result. 60% of the voters in my city and 62% of the voters in Scotland voted to remain in the EU so I thought it would be a clear win for ""remain"" but I hadn't realised just how pro-leave the rest of the UK was. In the Scottish independence referendum, I voted for Scotland to stay part of the UK because I wasn't convinced that the potential benefits of independence outweighed the potential negatives. Now though, I think I probably would prefer to be in the EU to being in the UK, if I had to choose just one of them. I've no idea what will happen. There's a general election next month where, presumably, Scotland will elect fifty-odd SNP MPs again and the UK will end up with a Conservative government so people here will feel unrepresented."
anti	I was in London earlier. Didn't see many foreign people celebrating all white British. Didn't like the atmosphere and felt it was very rasist. It's in God's hands now.
anti	"I was in London when it happened. I remember walking around a premiere European Capital that tangibly felt like less of a European Capital than it had just a year earlier, and thinking solemnly ""These poor bastards. Glad I live in the good ol' US of A where we would never do something this stupid."""
pro	I was in favour of EU reform, but it became clear with Cameron‚Äôs failed attempts that the EU would never reform. It is a fanatical, extremist project that is in total denial that it is failing. I therefore voted leave.
pro	I was ineligible to vote in the referendum but would not have hesitated to vote 'Leave'.
pro	I was ineligible to vote in the referendum but would not have hesitated to vote 'Leave'. The more I learn about the ambitions, unaccountability and record of the EU and the Commision the more I am against it. How could the manufactured migrant crisis happen? It took the stripping of national sovereignty and overt threat of retaliation from Brussles to enable this catastrophe. And Britain will not be the last to abandon it's membership- you can count on that. Thank god.
anti	I was just discussing with a leaver in another forum how curtailing freedom of movement would adversely affect my family‚Äôs lives. He simply did not get it. His eventual position was that he couldn‚Äôt afford foreign holidays anyway so nobody else should have one, ever, but mainly he wanted Romanians to all go home. It‚Äôs like arguing with a paper bag, honestly. But what was abundantly clear was that it was all abut him. All his points were totally self-serving, and devoid of any empathy for the consequences anyone else might have to suffer. This is why I don‚Äôt like leavers.
pro	I was never a Eu citizen I have never held a passport I have always been a subject of the queen
pro	I was not asked if I wanted to ne tuled by Brussels, a couple of elite MP‚Äôs signed our country over to the EU without our consent.
pro	I was on the fence until the very last minute. The major points that swung it for me: I do not believe in a federal Europe, I don't trust DC deal on a Referendum on ever closer union. Inside of this, I do not believe in wealth redistribution inside of the union except through means of trade and aid where it's needed. I don't believe the EU acts in our interest, nor would I except it to do so I would like our Government to have control over our borders and our money. That said, and I stress, I have no problem what so ever with immigrants as people, I do have some problem with the scale immigration - although I'll be surprised if that changes. I do not like the smuggness of the EU leaders, see DC's attempt at a new deal and even though our MEPs where united about the Ports regulation we were ignored. I did not like be condescended by the Remain campaign. Whilst I did find the Leave campaign to also be rather flawed, these flaws where blown out of proportion by Remain. (IE the 350mil figure IS still a valid one .. yes we spend much of that ourselves, no we couldn't just spend it on the NHS if we left, but that is what we loose direct control over) If we weren't already in the EU, we'd never even dream of entering it now
anti	I was opposed to Brexit and my reasons for that are still there. Our exit has happened and I agree that we must now make the best of a bad job. Realism. But Mr Johnson should stop relying on windy rhetoric and make the best of it - realism.
anti	I was told there would be a dividend. Maybe they meant to the owners of all those outsourcing companies we will be paying small fortunes to make this gigantic cluster fuck slightly less gigantic.
anti	I was waiting for victorious hate messages for me to come in. Would have been nice to be proven wrong, but it wasn‚Äôt to be. I‚Äôm not interested in sharing them. But let me say: your hate hasn‚Äôt silenced me before, it won‚Äôt do so now. Enjoy your Brexit & #BrexitDay. You own it now.
anti	I was woken up early by the thought of how I would feel if #Brexit happens. It's not good. Intense despair would be one emotion, and extreme anger and hate would be another. If a few million people feel like me, this country will be heading for very bad times. #StopBrexit
pro	I went to five of the best pubs in London and to Parliament Square. The atmosphere was amazing. Strangers shaking each others hands. Absolutely brilliant day out in London. So glad that I was at this historic moment...
anti	I will NEVER be bullied and blackmailed into accepting any form of #Brexit. May's deal leaves us permanently weaker; Corbyn's deal would do exactly the same. Give us a #PeoplesVote. Otherwise, martial law is on all who brought us to this point.
anti	I will always be a European. I will always think, and act, and move through the world as a European. I will always live by the values of inclusion, kindness, community and solidarity. #Brexit is a Crime Scene. One day the real tale will be told. #StillEuropean #AlwaysEuropean
pro	I will await today's excuse as to why remainers' promises did not come true
anti	I will be 100% honest with you, if the UK vote leave on Thursday I will be ashamed to call myself British, I will have no option but to apply for my Finnish passport as I would feel sickened if I had to tell people I was British.
anti	I will be fine. Just not as rich as I might have been. Enjoy unemployment, losing your house, poverty, misery, and depression, you mugs.
anti	I will be registering to vote this week. I will be voting to stay in the EU.
pro	I will be voting leave because I believe that Britain must be a self-governing, democratic independent nation in order to ensure that it both preserves it's cultural identity and delivers economic prosperity for generations to come.
pro	"I will be voting leave, The most important issues for me are immigration and sovereignty so it makes sense for me to vote to leave. I feel that both sides have been just as bad and have been trying to scaremonger people into voting for what they want, but this seems to be a common thing in British politics, a similar sort of ""Its the end of the world!"" thing happened when the Scottish referendum was happening."
pro	I will be voting to Leave because I don't like having to answer to Brussels and I want us to be able to control our own borders.
pro	I will expect my democratic vote honoured a full independent Britain, No deal is the deal. We never voted for deals we voted out.
anti	I will miss the UK! I think you gave up too fast. Of course the EU is far away of beeing perfect but to say good bye...a little bit childish!?
anti	I will never accept a Brexit decision as I can't support negation of what has continued to be an extremely successful peace project in Europe
anti	I will never accept a Brexit decision as I can't support restrictions on my children's rights in the world
anti	I will not support Brexit as I can see no benefit to it
pro	I will say I did vote partly because of immigration and other reasons, but it was mainly for sovereignty. EDIT - OP, the media has made leave votes how to be racist. Whilst I am sure some are, the large majority of leave votes just want control of our country back.
pro	I will vote leave. True, our economy will suffer in the short term, but the EU has been wallowing in deep economic trouble for a while now, and it still has not recovered. I honestly could not care less about immigration.
pro	I will vote to leave the EU. The happiest and most prosperous countries in Europe are Switzerland and Norway; non EU countries. Britain retains the pound and drives on the left. Britain had to sever Commonwealth ties to join the EU. Britain must set aside EU constraints to nurture old and new ties with other countries of the World.
anti	I wish Britain weren't so small minded, I want to stay in Europe and the eu but it will never happen until everyone who is a teen now becomes 18 and all the racists die off
anti	I wish for Britain to get poor and isolated after Brexit. No immigrant should ever come there as the British pound will be valued less than a US dollar. They would have long quees in the EU Embassy to get the Shenghen Visa. UK would lose all investors and all automotive industry to Ireland, no more Range Rover, Jaguar, Mini Cooper with the right wheel drive. That's gonna be a show to watch
pro	I wish i had the resources to produce a pro-brexit video of this quality.
anti	I wish non of this was happening
anti	I wish the EU well and I'm deeply embarrassed that the short sighted, right wing bigotry of Farage and co. has won the day. There are no benefits to the UK of leaving the EU and I'm sure that the EU will continue to grow and strengthen in our absence. At least they won't have to put up with the childish, obstructive antics of the Brexit Party any longer.
anti	I wish the UK wouldn't leave the EU, we can achieve so much more if we are united.
pro	I wish the best for UK Be unite Be united kingdom Be independent
pro	I wish the media would stop making it out that everyone in Scotland is against brexit because I and many others are so happy to be out.
anti	I wish there was hope, but we are all bracing for hard brexit. My country is a laughing stock right now.
anti	I wish they get it over and done with. I voted Remain for lots practical reasons (work, travel outside EU etc) but even I wouldn't want to stall the exit. The big problem is the uncertainty. I don't trust the leaders to make decent decisions but they have to at least decide something.. no one had a plan... idiots.
anti	I wish they would fire all that white smoke at all the people who voted leave
pro	I wish we could leave as well ...Good for you Brits, lot's of respect for taking your country back ... a frustrated Belgian civilian.
pro	I wish we had gone with no deal. And not given an inch or Euro to these mealy mouthed Eurocrats.
anti	I wish you the best UK citizen, for a dark time is coming and this one smells like 1930's. I will mourn your leaving next year, whatever it means to you Brexiters
anti	I wished I could of voted to remain.
anti	I wished we wouldn‚Äôt leave the EU
pro	I wobbled a bit this morning when I saw the reactions on Facebook. Around 98% of my Facebook friends were strongly remain. At our staff briefing the headteacher talked about it being a bad day. All my colleagues seemed to have voted remain, so I‚Äôve kept my vote private. I‚Äôve yet to come out on Facebook and I‚Äôm not sure I will, as I may have a lot of anger thrown at me. The EU is doomed to fail in the long- to very-long term, and Britain will do very well outside it. The EU is undeniably failing economically, and its principal solution seems to be increasing what is most likely to be causing the failure. I can foresee popular movements against the EU rising in several countries, indeed they already seem to be starting in the countries that have been in the EU the longest. It could become, as it has in the UK, an easy target for disaffected people to lash out at. I‚Äôm a Green party member. I think Labour have a strong chance in the next general election, and hopefully they can introduce proportional representation to produce the progressive, coalition government this country could have.
anti	I won't be happy at the loss of rights and access to the EU.
anti	I won't stop using #Brexit. I'll keep reminding #LiarJohnson of his false promises, and his corruption & criminality in pursuit of the impossible.
anti	I wonder how long it will take for the first Brexiter to openly admit some of 'project fear' warnings were actually spot on?
anti	I wonder how low can UK sink? Lost its empire, about to lose its economic might, will likely lose some of its provinces. We could be talking about England pretty soon.
anti	I wonder how many Brexiteers will stand up to be counted when things start going wrong, now that they can't blame The EU....? ;)
anti	I wonder how many pro brexit people would change their vote rightnow.
anti	I wonder how will Scotland and the Northern Island react if the Brexit will really happen!! Hopefully they move away from the UK and join the EU
anti	I wonder if the Queen‚Äôs applied for a German Passport. #Brexit
anti	I wonder why people who want to leave EU never give one good (or at least sensible) reason to do so...
anti	I work in the EU, have done for years, i love it's people's, it's culture, it's diversity, food, beer, ladies, I'm more European than ever, tory hatred of the EU has cost us, our rights are going, but our youth will return us in time, I'm celebrating with pals in the EU
anti	I work in the construction industry and know for a fact that young Brits are not attracted to the trades in the volumes they once were. The British workforce has got steadily older with the shortfall being filled by younger EU workers. The UK construction stands to lose up to 8 per cent of its workforce to Brexit putting the delivery of future infrastructure projects at risk.
pro	I work in the development of power generation in the UK, my market was almost destroyed by EU red tape and misreading/interpretting of their own rules
anti	I worry about the direction of the U.K. and U.K. politics and governance in the event of a Brexit.
anti	I woudl have thought the Europeans would be so pissed off by us by now that they would be more then happy to kick us out by now. *ashamed to be english*
pro	I would be over the moon if we left the self serving, thieving, lying #EU with a #NoDealBrexit They have taken enough from the people of Great Britain
anti	I would continue to vote reject Brexit simply because brexit has already made some companies quietly relocate out of the UK.
anti	I would have Brussels before British any day
pro	I would have voted to leave because of the sovereignty issue.
anti	I would laugh about it, if it wasn't so depressing. To start with, they made yes/no referendum about a way to complex matter, had a very close result, following a campaign full of misinformation and falls promises. To fulfill these promises would mean to get all the benefits of the EU without any of the obligations, which is ridiculous. May could have gone on and work with the parliament, to reach a deal with the EU to be a country like Norway (Very close in the EU, but not part of it). Instead she just ignored Parliament until the end, made a terrible compromise deal to fulfil some of the dumb promises made. Now parliament doesn't want that deal, no one wants a no-deal Brexit, but the time is running out and and a delay would result in the same problem just a few months later. It's just a total disaster from beginning to end.
anti	I would like a video explaining why some people want no deal. Majority of the evidence ranges from bad to very bad. Thanks.
anti	I would like to see the leavers acknowledge their error once it starts hitting, and not divert the blame or project on others. But yeah, we know that is not going to happen. We know immigrants and the poor will get the blame for the crisis. They steal jobs, they take welfare, and they don't work -all at the same time-.
anti	I would like to thank and congratulate my fellow remainers for behaving in such a tolerant, respectful and responsible way tonite. We've endured much provocation, but our dignified response will always be admired by the more neutral of observers among us. Ultimately, we can feel confident the facts and evidence will reverse this tragic mistake in the next few years. Until then, let the Brexiteers continue burying themselves.
anti	I would like to vote but as I have lived outside the UK for more than 15 years I can't vote. However if the UK leaves it is likely that I will have to leave my job and return to the UK where I probably wont be able to find work so I will end up living on the dole and costing the UK tax payer money.
pro	I would love to see the breakup of the EU. Nation states should free themselves from the voluntary shackles offered by cynical, deceitful, anti-democratic, sneering control freaks. I voted because of the almost insurmountable obstacles to reform in Europe. Other member states, and some of our own representatives, were far too keen on keeping in place the undemocratic practice of appointing rejected leaders to positions of power in Europe. The way the Mediterranean countries have been treated has also been a disgrace. The initial hit to the economy is going to be painful. I hope it passes as people get a grip on what‚Äôs actually happening. Trade is not ceasing, barriers are not being erected, hard-working Europeans aren‚Äôt being deported. I also hope the people of Britain will face the coming challenges united, and bury any ambition of demanding more referendums on previously settled matters. It‚Äôs the EU‚Äôs way to tell everyone to vote again, not ours.
pro	I would never dream of voting Tory, and I am fully for Brexit. How does that fit into your condescending worldview?
pro	I would never in a million years change my decision to leave.With the EU being exposed for what it is I cannot for the life of me understand why anyone would want to remain and belong to such a corrupt, unelected undemocratic organisation run by a bunch of rabid clowns !!! - and they think leavers are thick!!!
pro	I would rather just be out.
pro	I would still VOTE LEAVE
pro	I would vote leave all over again. Don't listen to these bias networks so fake and corrupt.
pro	I would vote leave now more than ever, the lies and the people who are involved with the remain. Side make me even more. Enthusiastic to leave
pro	I would vote to leave if I could.
anti	I would vote to remain, if there is another clean vote to remain. England imports from china, not exports goods to china. I do not think you understand trade policies and the better position you are in within the EU. You have your own currency. You have greater influence in the EU. Now what? join NAFTA, you will have zero influence in that Batshit crazy system.
anti	I wouldn't let this Government run a bath let alone trust them to deal with Brexit properly. Just bin Brexit and get back to normality.
anti	I wouldn't trust UK politicians to find their way out of a paper bag. Luckily, the economy doesn't rely on them but the Govt has enough influence to screw things up when times are good and worsen them when they're bad. Brexit will be a long, drawn out, painful and unecessary process which, like all divorces, will benefit lawyers the most! It'll take at least 5 years to complete after which we'll probably wonder why we bothered in the first place because the world is changing anyway due to unrelated factors and completely different reasons.
pro	I wouldn't worry about barnier and tusk. They will be remembered as the men who presided upon the fall of the great eu experiment as more and more EU nations fall out with the Brussels dictatorship.
pro	I wouldn‚Äôt blow them up. If I ever got into power I‚Äôd give you all ¬£5,000 to ¬£10,000 and ask you to leave. I don‚Äôt believe that Islam should be in the west, no. This is a Christian country
anti	I wouldn‚Äôt trust a Brexiteer to make me a sandwich.
pro	I wouldn‚Äôt worry much just give it time the EU will collapse especially with the rise of extreme right parties all over Europe. UK has been intelligent in leaving
anti	I'd feel worse that leavers have stripped him of so many opportunities for his future.
anti	I'd give my left testicle to have PM Trump for 8 years instead of Brexit.
pro	I'd honestly prefere to just leave without a deal and end this charade.
pro	I'd like to see a detailed account of what we allegedly owe this nest of gangsters before one penny is paid. Justify the ¬£39Bn if you can, Barnier, then our side can put in a counter claim regarding how much the EU owes us as one of the 9 nations which actually pays into the EU budget.
pro	I'd rather be free with a bag of chips, than in chains at a 5 course dinner!! Congrats Britain you are free once more!!!
pro	I'd rather nuke europe than stay in.
anti	I'd rather see it not happening, but it will be a prime example of a fuck up, so no-one else will do the same mistake
anti	I'd rather see it not happening, but it will be a prime example of a fuck up, so no-one else will do the same mistake.
pro	I'll be dead, but I know that my children and their children...they will be British, independent - and it's a new era for them.
anti	I'll be very surprised if the UK remains a whole after all this nonsense.
pro	I'll be voting out, democracy and sovereignty are not things the eu takes seriously considering parliament has already practically given our sovereignty away early to Brussels which is illegal, proof of an unwillingness to fight for English common law and the English bill of rights, along with the introduction of mandatory registration of births which is a manufacture of consent to take my child under some cited bureaucracy which missed baby p... If we save the money we pay the eu and go for a basic income benefit for all Ontop of work, to end wage slavery child poverty, hunger, adult education and entrepreneurial barriers finally and save the job center finding me a job for less than the London living wage anyway, can't unionise, can't go to uni, can't find out when I'm being fired, or why without a tribunal which makes finding work harder next time. Meanwhile we bail out dodgy.financial institutions and.subsidise the rich for looking after their short term profits and.relocating manufacturing abroad paying less tax in the process while my local shopkeeper breaks his back for his wage and would get arrested if he couldn't afford it while those that can pay more early pay less last, our politicians are too disconnected from the power of the people the 97% at least. The eu is relic of a nwo we Need to abandon now n plan much later.. when it includes people like me and you, not a load of terrorists Obama, George and.Blair helped anger supporting wars we knew were illegitimate. Parliament next.
anti	"I'll be voting to remain. I haven't bothered paying any attention to the nonsense spouted by both campaigns. I've just made a value judgment of the situation and came to my own conclusion. Financially, it's a risk. Sure we could end up benefitting by leaving long term but the chances of us quickly securing a good trade deal aren't fantastic. Leaving the EU is a political statement and people are a little deluded for thinking we have a wealth of bargaining power. We don't. I can imagine a trade deal distinguishing between goods and services to our disadvantage. I'm not phased by the 'reclaim our parliamentary sovereignty' argument. It's not like we were unaware of the supremacy of EU law when agreeing (Lord Bridge's words come to mind: ""there is nothing in any way novel in according supremacy to rules of Community law in those areas to which they apply""). Also, EU law is a bloody good tool for individuals. Common law fundamental rights are dubious. Convention rights give rise to interpretation or a DoI, that's about it. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights allows us to dis-apply existing domestic law (insofar as there is conflict). That is very useful for vindicating individuals' rights, and provides a useful check against the state given the lack of real accountability (political sovereignty of the electorate is a sham). I would have voted not to join the EU in the first place. We should be adhering to the principle of subsidiarity wherever possible. Devolution (even if at the expense of the Union) should have been preferred. But hey, now we're in the position we're in and we've got to deal with it. Academia would suffer post-Brexit and I imagine that's an important subconscious factor for me."
anti	I'll believe it when I see it. What I expect from Johnson is a fake Brexit, and more of the same that Britain's been getting for the last thirty years.
pro	I'll keep fighting for the best, most successful Brexit.
anti	I'll move to Scotland, see ya Britain
anti	I'll never for give them - or the idiots that voted for it.
pro	I'll never taste a piece of bacon that tasted as good as this result.
pro	I'll take the pain if there is any, just to be free from the E.U politicians who ridicule, insult and try controlling this country.
anti	I'm #voteremain tomorrow because I have two young daughters who I want to have opportunities to work, study and travel freely across Europe
pro	I'm 18 and I'm voting to leave. The media are making out as if loads of young people want to stay but I know loads of people my age who want to leave- it's not just older people!
pro	I'm 19 and I voted out I must be a racist and uneducated obviously
pro	I'm 40 married with 2 young children and a home owner. I've always been Pro Europe my whole life in fact I have been of the opinion that total Europe is the best solution. A European super state would dominate the world economically and politically. Unfortunately I'll be voting Leave. I'm doing this because of immigration only. The housing market is knackered and my children will struggle to own their own home when they grow up. I know this is because of government policy but if they aren't going to do anything about it then what choice do we have? If immigration can be reduced then demand for housing and public services may stop climbing so rapidly. I'm also angry at Europe because when Cameron went to euro leaders telling them that we were unhappy and may vote to leave they didn't take him seriously and gave some very insignificant concessions. I'm sure the economy will be wobbly after Brent but just as we wouldn't want to stop trading with Europe they wouldn't want to stop trading with us. If they cut off their noses to spite their faces then balls to them anyway.
anti	I'm 58 (with a mother who was a child in WW2) and well remember fearing my generation would be pulled into a European war because they happened every generation. But now we're three generations in without a major war in Europe and it's the EU that's done it.
anti	I'm 63, voted remain, and hate Brexit with every fibre of my being, in large part because of the impact on my children and their families. Not everyone in their 60s is impervious to the effect on younger people.
pro	I'm American but I agree with brexit.
pro	I'm British ... I voted leave ... and I haven't changed my mind!
anti	I'm British and i'm voting to stay. the EU needs reform but leaving will be like cutting the nose off in spite of the face. if it doesn't reform it's doomed anyway.
pro	I'm Dutch but I'm jealous of the UK being separated of the EU.
pro	I'm Dutch but I'm jealous of the UK being separated of the EU. I wish we were
pro	I'm Dutch but I'm jealous of the UK being separated of the EU. I wish we were!
anti	I'm English. I work in England for an British company, fitting Dutch made materials onto German made vehicles for a German headquatered multinational that is 75% owned by the French government. My wife is an EU citizen. My livelihood and family life depends on free trade and freedom of movement. Remain.
pro	I'm French and live in UK and i've always waiting for this moment
anti	"I'm Portuguese and I know the Portuguese Empire was huge a few centuries ago, just like Britain. But we're in 2019! British people need to set aside their ""Nationalism"" pride and realize that alone, the EU small countries are no match to nowadays superpowers (USA, Russia and China). Not only did the EU keep all countries in peace for decades, it led to a fast development of all EU members. Of course we lose a very small part of our freedom, but imagine if the USA states all separated... 90% of them would become weak and irrelevant in the world's economy. They are strong because they are together, and we need to work together as Europeans in order to thrive!"
anti	I'm Scottish and I voted no. As soon as my country regains its Independence, it will rejoin the EU. Flame away you brexiteer fuckheads.
anti	I'm UK, and I never wanted brexit.
pro	I'm a 22 year old Brit whose been sitting on the fence for a long time but have recently decided I will be voting to leave. I'm a strong believer in democracy and in my eyes the EU is entirely undemocratic. We can vote for MEPs who can neither suggest new laws nor repeal existing European laws. The real power in Europe lies in the hands of the unelected. 10,000 of the bureaucrats at the EU earn more than our Prime Minister. Whilst I believe there will be short term economic repercussions of leaving, in the long run I hope to be better off. Businesses like stability which is why I think so many support the remain campaign. I don't believe these big multinational companies share the interests of the common man though. A reading of this thread would suggest that the youth vote is firmly with the remain campaign. Amongst my friends (all recent graduates of different degrees from varying social backgrounds) opinion is split. Overall I've been really disappointed by the lack of impartial information on the referendum. It seems to me that neither side has any idea what will really happen if we leave!
pro	I'm a 24 year old male living in the UK and I would like to think I don't fall in to the 'sun reading racist' category, I am however planing on voting to leave. For me it has nothing to do with immigration, it's more to do with the crippling bureaucracy that comes with the EU. The best argument I have heard to remain is 'you can't fix it if you aren't in it' but it seems to me that even with Cameron's best efforts we can't fix it when we are in it. So that being said we have two options, we stay in a union we can't fix or we leave and have a go at fixing our situation on our own.
anti	I'm a Brit and I want to stay.
pro	I'm a Corbyn supporter who would vote to leave the EU tomorrow, if I was given the chance, after their meddling in Ukraine, the way they treated Greece.
pro	"I'm a UK citizen but have lived in Canada for 10 years. I have dual citizenship and never intend on returning to live or work in the UK or Europe. I am on the side of Leave, for one reason. The EU makes a mockery of democracy, I would not want anyone to live in a society where laws are created by those who are unelected, which is exactly what happens in the EU. I agree with EU policies most of the time, however if I did not there would be no recourse. It smacks of a system that is just waiting to be abused. Because of the way I lean on this issue I did not mail-in vote, I think it would be pretty rich for someone who is against people outside of a country telling it how to be run, to then vote in an election in a country I do not live it. I am glad that the conversation regarding the EU is taking place, however the UK has a bad reputation with having hilariously close referendums, and then simply ignoring the issue from then on out. ""We've already had a referendum, what more do you want?"" Thanks for reading."
pro	I'm a firm supporter of Brexit, but I'll only believe it when we leave behind all EU laws, we keep our hard earned taxes and we get our waters back. Until then, this is all smoke and mirrors...

pro	I'm a happy Leaver. Anyone else?
pro	I'm a leave voter, and I'll be totally honest with you.
pro	I'm a leaver, but I'm starting to see that a lot of the talk about brexiteers being thick is accurate in a lot of cases. ''We voted out. Just leave, no deal. Leave means leave''..
pro	I'm a reluctant for. If we remain in the EU, it will not reform, the reason for this is simple, it's too big to reform. Any reforms take years to actually get to the EU parliament and even then they may not pass. If we vote to leave, it will empower all the other anti-EU or reform EU parties and then finally, the EU will have to listen or lose the entire European project.
anti	I'm a remainer but I think it's wrong to delay Brexit.
anti	I'm a remainer who would like a second referendum, however I can see a reasonable argument not to have one
anti	I'm afraid that Leavers became a sect if fanatics completely resistant to the reality and truth. Absolute Teflon.

anti	I'm afraid there are French people now emerging who think Brexit is brilliant, and want to do the same thing in France, just because they don't like Macron. I don't like him either, but I think Brexit is possibly the worst idea in living memory.
anti	I'm against Brexit, but the reason is you know, because democracy?¬†You can't just overthrow parliament because you dislike them. Which would also coincidentally lead to actual civil war with the half of the population who voted for Brexit.
anti	"I'm against the Brexit, for the same reasons I would have been against Scotland leaving the Union. The people who are ""for"" have not proposed a realistic (or any real) vision of what it would look like"
anti	I'm against us leaving the EU. For many reasons. Mainly because I distrust every politician who says we should leave (and what few politicians I do respect enough to have a modicum of trust for are also against leaving the EU) and I have absolutely no truck with the mainstream media scaremongering. I absolutely do not believe that staying in the EU will lead to a flood of refugees 'invading' our country. I absolutely believe staying in the EU gives us more protections from greedy corporate bastards who don't give a fuck about anything other than their swelling bank balances.
pro	I'm an American, but I 100% support British freedom from foreign fascism. Hope that a 'big, beautiful' trade deal with the U.S. is soon to follow‚Ä¶ Congratulations to the UK‚Ä¶
pro	I'm an American, but it was very interesting watching this from the outside. Go Britain. Nationalism for the win!
pro	I'm an Englishman living in France. I know what goes on here--- for God's sake, get out.
anti	I'm an ashamed English person. I'm disowning my country
anti	I'm anti brexit because of the loss of trade and harm it will do to the UK economy. Stuff the racism and xenophobia arguments against leaving.
anti	I'm ashamed to be English. I am really starting to hate my country
anti	I'm ashamed to be british
pro	I'm considered a millennial and everyone I know voted to leave and we would all do it again.
pro	I'm filled with renewed confidence that Brexit will be a roaring success
pro	I'm for Brexit despite the fact it's more popular for young people my age to vote remain. I'd first start by saying both campaigns have been atrocious and I think everyone on both sides mutually understands this which is why it's been so hard for some people to make a decision without seeing a balanced argument. The reasons I have for voting Brexit are: We don't have full control of our own laws and quite frankly the EU is not democratic. We cannot remove any of these ridiculous 5 presidents they have in the EU making laws which govern us, which is a serious flaw. Part of democracy is being able to hold our officials accountable and remove them from power. Remain does acknowledge this but argues that we should stay in to still have a seat at the negotiating table so to speak, well we only have 13% of the vote and as more countries join the EU we lose influence. Quite frankly the other countries will vote for what benefits them most which for much of the EU that is poorer it is usually not in our best interests.I mentioned more countries joining the EU, and that's an issue. Turkey is on the fast track to joining the EU, and as far as I'm concerned this poses a threat to the UK. Turkey has supposedly got flawed border security and there's been lots of reports of buying ISIS oil etc and in general supporting them, regardless of that fact if you look at /r/worldnews it gets saturated with the shit Erdogan does. Having Turkey join means free movement into the UK which I don't want.Remain says we'll plunge into recession leaving and most financial institutes agree with this. Well no shit, who'd have thought dissolving our EU membership and trade deals would have an impact on our economy? Of course it will but let's be honest people are self interested and the UK is the 5th largest economy currently. So many other countries will want to trade with us because it's beneficial to them. If you look at some of the people who endorse remain/leave you'll see they mostly have business interests either in the EU or outside it which financially motivates their vote. In addition, Europe is a stagnating economy; It has the slowest rate of economic growth over any other continent. I believe in the long term with new trade deals in Asia/South America we'd be better off in the long run but we would have a period of recession first.The NHS is quite the political football at the moment. On the one hand the migrants who come here do the NHS a great service and are the backbone of our healthcare system. I'd be concerned with losing many of them but I would expect we will focus on allowing in skilled migrants to work in the NHS and also encouraging more Brits to enter into healthcare, albeit hard to do with the Jeremy Cunt fiasco. So I have faith we'd be able to populate it with enough workers. By leaving I hope we'd be able to both membership fee money on the NHS and also avoid being forced into TTIP.Immigration needs to be controlled. If we maintain unstable rates of growth it puts too much pressure on public services as well as things we also have issues with at the moment, like housing. Additionally the current free movement is biased against the rest of the world. Any unskilled worker from the EU can come to the UK over say a skilled engineer from Korea or Japan. It's said a lot but we do need a points based immigration system like Australia. A lot of the lefties jump at calling it racist or saying we have a humanitarian duty to take in more people but quite frankly it isn't racist it's common sense, and I agree we should help people as much as we can but if you look at the European immigration crisis the vast majority of people who have come to EU countries are economic migrants who aren't from Syria, they're from northern Africa or elsewhere in the Middle East. I feel we should focus on fixing problems in our country first before helping other people. I'll leave this for now because It's reaching the point where I'm ranting about problems but these should give an idea of the way I'm thinking. For the most part I avoided using facts/figures because quite frankly they get thrown around all over the place and no one really knows what's going on.
anti	"I'm for remain, but I live in the US (yes, am a brit). I like the premise of Europe cooperating on things, and having collective bargaining and rights. For example, I'd like to be able to go and work in Germany without having to get a work permit. I think the Remain camp should have had a bigger strategy. For example ""We will find allies towards a progressive dismantlement of Brussels and Strasbourg. Elected and appointed officials will come home and do all business with distant colleagues by video conferencing, thus ending the expenses gravy-train"". Sure, they'd need an industrial strength video conferencing solution, and would have to have a moderator to prevent the all-speak-at-once problem, but I think Google and Microsoft would compete to supply that for free. Westminster could benefit from the same perhaps too."
pro	I'm french and happy for Great Britain. I hope that there will be a Frexit one day.
pro	I'm from Britain and what you just said was a complete lie brexit is going to be the best thing thats happed in UK and we are leaving because they are fludding the UK with refugees
pro	I'm from Poland and I'm jealous of this decision
pro	I'm from Scotland, want a hard brexit and wish to remain in the uk. Time to close our borders before England is a full on Muslim country. Get on with it.
anti	I'm from the UK and me and almost everyone I know love the idea of the EU and very much consider ourselves as European
anti	I'm from the UK. I don't think we should leave. I think we should try and make the EU better. Instead if just abandoning it.
pro	I'm generally fine with it. The EU is a very different beast than it was when the UK started, and maintaining national sovereignty is a worthwhile goal.
pro	I'm glad The British people voted to leave the EU. and get control of their country back. I have faith in the British people, CHEERS!
pro	I'm glad UK left the EU. The EU is useless
pro	I'm glad the British voted brexit and said no to globalism
pro	I'm glad we left
pro	I'm glad we're leaving
anti	I'm going to feel sorry for the English people after brexit economic collapse, who are going to work like slaves just to pay bills and the government steals them worse than they are already doing
pro	I'm going to stop you right there mein Freund and make you listen to a parody of a leaver. &gt; **What do you think about Brexit and why do you think that** &amp;#x200B; Brexit is good Cos we won tha war!!
anti	"I'm having a very ""lively"" dialog with several British friends through social media regarding Brexit, and the mood is clear: an atmosphere of pure fantasy has gripped a sizeable number of people."
anti	"I'm heartbroken. A deeply sad day, which historians shall cite as the extraordinary moment a minority of a population ""won"" the right to strip their children of their own future. Baffling."
pro	I'm honestly optimistic about the UK'S future outside of the EU, only time will tell to see if I'm right about that
anti	I'm hoping and praying that Brexit gets called off.
anti	I'm hugely upset about Brexit. I think the EU is a beacon of light in a dangerous world, and the UK government have decided to leave under dubious circumstances
pro	I'm in Germany everyone I've spoken to here says they wish Germany would do the same
anti	I'm in scotland and we voted to stay and we might get it
pro	I'm in total agreement with Boris... lets just get Brexit done so that we as a nation can move on and concentrate on everything else thats taken s backseat for the last 3 years!
pro	I'm incredibly proud to call this man my Prime Minister. Please, retweet the hell out of this.
pro	I'm irish and uk leaving the customs union will have a big affect on IReland but I support the UK leaving, you need to take ur country back.
anti	I'm just curious how the UK will negotiate with the EU by the end of the year when they don't even know what they want
anti	I'm just curious how the UK will negotiate with the EU by the end of the year when they don't even know what they want...well at least it's not going to be boring
pro	I'm just glad we're out of that french dictatorship
anti	I'm just worried that as a resident, the standard of living will go down, prices will go up, I'm worried about the economy, etc.
anti	I'm late to the thread but in case another opinion is still useful to you... I'm a non-EU migrant to the Netherlands and was living in England in 2016 when the referendum results were announced. It was baffling to me - after the thousands of Euro and all the beauracratic hoops I had to jump through to obtain a residency permit, here is an entire European nation DELIBERATELY throwing away its people's EU citizenship rights! Genuinely made me wonder how many voters had lived as non-EU citizens (i.e. been adults pre mid-70s) and if they had any idea that they could even vote for their MEP (as I can not without citizenship) let alone ever lobbied their MEP to make the changes they would like to see in the EU. While I m aware of the flaws in the EU (the Eurozone is pretty questionable, and large chunks of the EU budget are often squandered) the principle is sound and the simple bliss of living in peace time cannot be easily dismissed. My heart goes out to the destitute poor and working poor of the UK, it's been an ugly decade and will only get worse.
anti	I'm laughing so hard at the comments about Britain being British again. LMAO have you seen London? All that new money comes from Nigeria, the Middle-east, Russia and China. Britain needs that money to sustain a healthy economy but yet they want to see immigrants as pests. Well congrats to you all. I'm curious what this is going to look like.
anti	I'm looking forward to the day we go crawling back to the eu
pro	I'm mid twenties and I voted leave.
pro	I'm minted and vote Leave. Why would I want to be surrounded by poor people? It makes being rich a bit stressful.
anti	I'm moving to Canada.
pro	I'm no political genius but surely there must be more advantages to leaving than remaining, I voted leave but I just cannot understand why there is such an outcry to remain, can someone explain to me why
pro	I'm not English but I support the U.K.'s desire to leave the E.U. because liberal policies screw countries
pro	I'm not a baby boomer and I voted for Brexit. I find it quite disheartening to see how twisted the reasons for Brexit have become that people believe that leave voters chose to do so based out of spite.
pro	I'm not angry im really happy that the EU want's a no deal brexit. That's what we voted for!!!
anti	I'm not bitter and I accept #Brexit is happening but withdrawing from frictionless trade with our neighbouring market of 500M people is an act of blatant, jaw-dropping stupidity and I'm not going to stop saying so now.
pro	I'm not doing this for the UK. I'm doing this for ALL europeans.
anti	I'm not entirely sure you're going to be able to negotiate a better deal. UK will lose 45% of export, and quite a bit of import from the EU. If the EU will deny trade with the UK, the UK would jump down a massive economic black hole. The entire economic viability depends on the willingness of the EU to continue trading after the Brexit. If that's not on the table, the UK will have to be damn sure it can replace all it's EU import and export, by making new trade agreements with its biggest suppliers and consumers of goods. But they'd be doing this at a severe disadvantage. Some people will say you can use Switzerlands model, or Norways model, but there is no evidence supporting that the EU will allow this. Neither countries were ever in the EU. For the EU it was a win-win situation, and maybe they'll join the EU later on. Trade with the UK after Brexit would still be beneficial for Europe, but it depends on how much the EU would want to make a statement about a member leaving. Europe could economically survive the Brexit (it would still sting for members states), it's difficult to say if the UK would survive it too, if trade with the EU would stop. Losing a tiny bit of export/import is do-able, but 45% of export? I'm not so sure. I don't even understand how you can consider the possibility of a Brexit till you can address the severe economic uncertainty and can guarantee that the Brexit isn't also an economical exit.
pro	I'm not from Britain but I agree with the result. You have to cut off from the nipple at some point and it's going to be hard. There will be struggles and trying times but in the end everyone in Britain will reap the benefits. We as Americans struggled for awhile after leaving the British but we became the most powerful country in the world(maybe not so much anymore!). I believe Britain will become a powerhouse after cutting ties to all the countries feeding off them like leeches.
anti	I'm not going to cry if companies leave the UK because they can't afford to pay British people livable wages. Not everyone wants to live 6 to a 1 bed flat
anti	I'm not going to mourn #BrexitDay, nor celebrate. I'm feeling defiant & determined, so will be wearing the boots which I created for the anti-Brexit protests!
pro	I'm not going to vote, since I'm a Belgian citizen. I'm a Bruxiter, which is to mean that I want to get rid of the EU. And Brexit is an important step on that way. I follow the news of several countries but mainly France, the UK, Belgium, Italy, Germany, etc... and I follow several country subreddits and one thing has struck me: it's like everyone is totally disconnected from what is happening elsewhere. It's like everyone is staring at their own navel and not seeing what's happening in the other EU member countries. When you make the effort to look at the bigger picture, to connect the dots so to speak, I don't understand for the life of me why you would want to stay in the EU. Didn't you see how the EU bullied Greece and is now bullying Italy? Don't you ever read about the German debate about the Euro? Don't you see how impopular Macron has become? Don't you know there have been two referendums in the Netherlands, one concerning the Constitutional Treaty in 2005 and more recently one on the association agreement between the EU and the Ukraine, twice the Dutch voted no, twice their political class wiped their asses with the result? I mean, when you look at the bigger picture, how can you not conclude that what's happening now in the UK is the exact same scenario that has been played over and over again in Europe the past 30 years? But maybe that's exactly the problem, you don't look at the bigger picture.
pro	I'm not interested in seeing EU fail. I'm just not interested in Britain being a part of it any more.
anti	I'm not just a Remainer. I'm a European through and through, and the rats have taken over the ship.
anti	I'm not pro-Brexit, if that's what you mean
pro	I'm not saying businesses are bad, we NEED businesses and traid. I just don't want BP passing legislations for us. The UK used to produce a lot of stuff so we exported loads, now we import more then we sell. Outside the EU, we'd have better trading prospects, It won't be free traid, But there will be more options.
anti	I'm not saying that everyone who voted for Brexit is stupid.... but every stupid person did vote for Brexit.
anti	"I'm not so sure they are. Sure, there will be some of those in there, but I think for many people, they have no idea of or care for how the country's finances work, where the money comes from that pays for their beloved NHS, police, defence etc - they just think it grows on a tree and/or ""the rich"" will pay. Hence labour's appeal."
pro	I'm not white, and I'm 19. I voted leave. It's not about remembering tyranny. It's about appreciating freedom.
pro	I'm often too afraid to publicly voice my view and stance on the referendum. I'm a young person of an ethnic minority (I'm Asian), born and raised in Britain, learning 3 European (2 of them are Slavic) languages, yet I'd still be regarded as a racist because I'm voting leave. It's silly that people instantly assume that if someone's voting leave, they're a racist.
anti	I'm one of those weirdos who believes that the recent wave of immigration and our membership of the EU have been wholly beneficial to the UK. I'm even more weird in knowing that official data backs me up.
pro	I'm only 26 so I'm not like the vast majority of those my age who voted remain but like you, I've lived all over. UK obviously, USA, UAE, China, Africa. I voted leave for the EXACT reasons you listed. There are so many more opportunities for us as a country out there and I want us to be in the best position to capitalise on these. Reading reddit abd watching the news these past 48 hours has made my blood boil. Yes I can understand people are frustrated by the result but fucking hell not everyone who voted leave is a racist, uneducated, economically illiterate bastard. There are a multitude of reasons to vote for one or the other side and now that the decision has been made we should all just move on together and make the best out of the have we've been dealt.
anti	I'm pissed off because Scotland my country voted to stay
anti	I'm pissed off because Scotland my country voted to stay but of course Westminster just ignored our votes completely
anti	I'm pretty sure everyone in the union is getting their services etc at a much cheaper rate than compared to other countries who have to maintain their own agencies for those services. So in a sense we are all getting more out if than if we were to go at it solo. That is all that matters in the end. You have to provide those services anyways. It's hard to put all this in numbers to show what the actual return is so it often gets overlooked I feel.
anti	I'm pretty sure we made the wrong decision
anti	I'm pretty sure we made the wrong decision.
pro	I'm pro-Europe. I'm just anti-Brussels.
anti	I'm probably just gonna move to a different country... Oh wait they wouldn't want my dumb British arse
pro	I'm proud Brexiteer and am even more determined now than I was on referendum day.
pro	I'm rather sure the US, Canada, Australia, and Singapore would also enter into very favorable trade agreements with the UK in the event of a Clean Brexit. Taken together, this is a much larger trading pool than the EU. And a better one as well.
anti	I'm ready to get off Brexit. Greatest mistake.
pro	"I'm really glad the UK left the EU. I don't know why Scotland would want to join the ""pit of vipers"" EU."
pro	I'm really happy for UK! This is the end of EUnarism and beggining of the real United Kingdom. All support from Serbia, wishing you all the best!
pro	I'm really hoping we Leave - 10 years ago I was pro-EU but I've watched it closely and now want Leave for many many reasons (below). I think the EU's greatest achievement now is the Worlds Biggest Quango.
anti	I'm rooting for a no deal brexit because I believe that uninformed, stupid voting must be punished.
anti	I'm sad to watch the UK self destruct, and sad that there's nothing we can do to help. You're free to seek oblivion in your own way, but you're not going to drag us down with you. Call us in 20 years if you come to your senses, fix your political system, and decide you really want to be on board. Otherwise don't waste any more of our precious time.
anti	I'm scared were going to actually end up out of the EU... do people actually understand what will happen if we leave?
anti	I'm shaking with anger and sadness here in Vienna, Austria. England's xenophobia has stolen my EU Citizenship and part of the identity I have created here with my family and friends
pro	I'm sick of Anti-brexit articles being pushed by the Biased Broadcasting Corporation at every opportunity.
pro	I'm sick of remainers. I initially voted remain (Only to avoid a higher cost of living, even if it's only for a few years) but I respect democracy and I now want to leave. No matter the margin, whether it's 1 vote or 3 million. The EU is corrupt and we need to leave for our independence. Tyranny shall lose. We can survive, albeit with short term extreme difficulty. Big riots will happen if not.
anti	I'm so angry if 'Leave' wins! Leaving the EU will ruin our economy and have more severe long-term repercussions. Pathetic, absolutely pathetic
anti	I'm so ashamed of my fellow countrymen!
anti	I'm so glad I'm not British. In truth, Britain is too weak and workshy to not be a European puppet state. They should accept their status and beg the EU to take them back. They will not be able to survive in the big wide world.
pro	I'm so glad we're leaving
pro	I'm so happy for you Brits, well done! I only wish we were leaving also.
pro	I'm so happy we have left the European Union
pro	I'm so proud of all my followers who have put country first and #voted to #Leave the rotten EU. I'm off to do my bit shortly - back later!
pro	I'm so proud of my fellow Britons. We voted to get our country back but will we? It's now a waiting game to see when Article 50 is triggered, soon hopefully. I've got no regrets about voting 'Out' and will do again if they try to stitch is up.
pro	I'm so proud that we all voted for British Sovereignty
anti	"I'm so tired. Wouldn't you know it, once again I left it until last minute to write all my Brexit Day cards........most of them contain the phrase ""I hope you're f**king happy......tw*t"""
pro	I'm sorry but the EU is no longer just 6 countries as they said here. There are 27 countres, but the main 6 or even main 2 (Germany and France) are behaving like the rest of the EU is their property. If this will still be as it is now there will be more quits from EU.
anti	I'm starting to believe the best thing would be for UKIP to get in at the next election , we leave the EU and the bastards that voted for them can reap the rewards, more unemployment, more disenfranchisemnet, more poverty and a meaner, sadder England (Scotland having voted to go independent).
pro	I'm starting to think a 'Brexit' is a good idea and I never thought I'd ever say that.
anti	I'm still European in my heart! I'm sad but I accept it because I have no other choice, but I will never be a British nationalist, I live in England and was raised in wales, Europe funded much of what gave me life and support, so it's in my life blood.
anti	I'm still raging. I see us a Northern European country, with many common connections across the North Sea. I feel like I've had people and things I believed in torn away from me. I was always pro-Yes, and genuinely believed that the best future for Scotland was one where the people of Scotland who lived and worked here were ones who made the decisions about the future of our nation. Brexit has only solidified my view that Scotland should be an independent, *European* nation. tl;dr: fuck Brexit.
anti	I'm stockpilling. I don't trust this government, they've been quite incompetent so far.
pro	I'm strongly for Leave as are most of the people I know, both offline and online. I've seen mainly Leave posters in my area (near London) and I get a sense that we are in the majority, even despite the absolutely shameful tactics of the Remain campaign and their allies. The argument is a simple one for me: it is about sovereignty. It is about liberty. It is about democracy. It is not about trinkets and baubles. The EU is anti-democratic, founded in the egregious civil law (say goodbye to due process, presumption of innocence, habeas corpus, jury trials, etc), has no concept of the rule of law, believe themselves above the law, and is ruining Europe economically. National sovereignty is hard to come by and even harder to keep. We have not fought and bled over centuries to defend it just to hand it on a plate to the EU. The planners and collaborators of this European Project have used stealth and deceit to bring us to this point. Why, if something be so good, would such methods be used? Think about that. My concern is that many young people - having been fed a pro-EU agenda through EU-funded British education institutions - no longer understand what sovereignty is and why it is important. They have been sold the lie of internationalism and, being ignorant of the lessons of history, may not realise their folly until it is too late.
pro	I'm sure it will be fine in the end
anti	"I'm sure that the A50 revocation aka ""please take me back, I'll behave"" letter is already drafted, ready to be sent to Brussels days before March 29."
anti	I'm very worried for our country. Johnson's Brexit plans are very extreme & he may even secretly want a catastrophic No Deal Brexit, which he will blame on the EU!
anti	I'm voting IN, because the UK can't fight climate change on its own. Why are you IN? #strongerin #eureferendum
pro	I'm voting Leave as I don't think 6 unelected people in Brussels should be able to dictate the laws of our country.
pro	I'm voting Leave to escape the United States of Europe, recession be damned. If the economy was such a sacred cow we'd never go into war or subsidise unsustainable industry
pro	I'm voting Leave to escape the United States of Europe, recession be damned. If the economy was such a sacred cow we'd never go into war or subsidise unsustainable industry.
pro	I'm voting Leave to restore Britain's national sovereignty and parliamentary democracy. Any other arguments - whether for or against - are immaterial.
pro	I'm voting Leave. I have campaigned for it and have appeared on the BBC as an invited panellist for sunday politics. I'm also a uni student up north. Why Leave? well, if this were a simple economic question i'd be remain. If the commission was really under the agenda set by our elected governments with oversight by a truly 'proportional' EP and council of ministers who did have genuine authority and power then I might be tempted to put up with it. But as it is, and as it looks like it is going, there are issues concerning the question of who governs? As long as it remains the fact that we have a situation where parliament is not the ultimate authority in regards to the laws by which we live then Leaving is justified regardless. There are plenty of examples of how the current, past and probable future behaviour and conduct of the various arms and institutions of the EU project. In 2009 the European Council - the heads of the elected governments (later excusing Mario Monti and Italy) - asked the Commission to consider internal austerity, i.e. cutting their own wages given the member states were themselves under fiscal pressure, the Commissioners (surprise surprise) didn't like this suggestion and took the Council to the ECJ. The ECJ found in favour of the commission, given the fact that if the wages of the commission were to come under scrutiny then logically the wages of other EU and Brussels-related institutions would be next. Powell and the Spectator were right in 1975 when they said (and even as Heath would admit) the future of the EEC was political. We keep being told about the uncertainty of Leaving, and I agree there will be huge challenges, but the future of the EU in uncertain and the EZ more so.
pro	I'm voting OUT. Europe is full of weak, poor and struggling countries. How can joining them be a good thing for us? I wish it were just France, Germany and UK in EU, now that would be a decent alliance and I'd be in.
pro	I'm voting leave. As I see it my civil liberties are undemocratically fucked two fold currently, I have the EU passing legislation I cannot refute and I have HM Civil Service passing legislation I cannot refute, I'd rather decrease the authoritative powers that be into a smaller cluster, rather than creating Yugoslavia 2.0. Am I frightened of the consequences of giving complete control to the fucktards that govern Britain? Yes I am. Am I worried about initial repercussions to the economy? Yes I am. But as it stands, what do we aspire to become within the EU? Other countries like Switzerland and Norway have a GDP twice as high. Perhaps I'm being optimistic but Britain has a trade surplus in almost every service sector except tourism, we have the ability to do well outside of the EU and smash the glass ceiling that is the EU trading bloc. We have the potential, we are the world‚Äôs fifth largest economy and fourth largest military power. One of only five countries with a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. The WTO has driven down trade tariffs and we'll be afforded the opportunity to import far cheaper without European trade quotas cock blocking us and gain far more access to international markets. In regards to immigration, it's not something the fearmongers have frightened me with, but I CAN see it pragmatically. The housing crisis (mostly private but some social) is unable to sustain the type of numbers we are receiving now without an influx from newly registered EU countries. I'm by no means a British nationalist, I just think we can emulate other non EU European countries to increase our standard of living.
anti	"I'm voting remain none of the leave campaign arguments have convinced me to change my mind. One of the biggest arguments my leave friends have been throwing around is how the EU is undemocratic and how they can vote on what laws to pass and we don't get a say but I don't understand how that's any different from Scottish, Irish and Welsh MPS getting to vote on English matters (like the tuition fee increase) because we don't have our own devolved parliament yet we don't get a say in what happens in their countries. No one's able to tell me what will happen if we leave because no one knows, ""facts"" they've been throwing around have been proven to be false so it doesn't make their argument look credible. Honestly at this stage I just can't wait till its over I'm sick of both sides and I'm sick of a lot of people getting wound up over it. Just because it's a referendum doesn't mean parliament actually has to do it, hell remain could win but we could still leave and vice versa. I just want to get back to normal life without this and the American election been shoved down our throats every day."
anti	I'm voting remain. I've lived in Mainland Europe and my parents and grandparents both worked there for a time and I believe staying in will be stronger for the country than going alone. However I feel I can't state this opinion to the general population because I'll be told I'm foolish and too young to understand the real issues of the world. I've been fed up with the campaigning from both sides for months and months I want us all to chill the fuck out and move on. Except we won't. Whatever we decide this week will cause a shit storm in Westminster and we'll have a general election by Christmas when all the shit will start to again. I vote because it's my right, I vote because it's important and I vote because I care.
anti	I'm voting remain. the EU is a known system, leaving is a risk we don't need to take. Plus I like being part of a larger system, unlike some of my countrymen I don't view the UK as some islands far away from europe. Plus in my more naive moments I like to imagine that this sort of large union could lead to the utopian future I read in sci-fi novels as a kid.
pro	I'm voting to leave although neither side has really left me with sufficient information to make an informed decision. I'm really curious to see what would happen if we do leave and see which side is right. The main reason why I want to leave is because we're actually having a referendum. If leaving was actually going to leave us in the financial turmoil that the remain campaign is saying that we will have if we leave then we wouldn't be having a referendum in the 1st place. David Cameron keeps saying that we can do this and that in the EU and that we have influence. Then why was he laughed at when he tried to negotiate a better deal for us within the EU? If that's how the EU reacted when we threatened to leave then what makes him think that if we remain with them they'll suddenly give us what we want? Barely anyone from the EU has even bothered to give their 2 cents or ask us to stay which is weird because we put in a lot of money to the EU and we take in a lot of migrants, they should care but most of them haven't shown that they do. The leave campaign aren't perfect either but at least they're trying to fix the problems that we have in this country. I hate almost all of the leading figures for both sides but when watching the debates I agree with a hell of a lot more points that the leave campaign says than the remain campaign.
pro	I'm voting to leave. As a 28 year old, under-paid, over-educated northerner, I have absolutely nothing lose. I would probably fare better, and even find more satisfaction in, scrapping for tins of beans on the street after the power goes off than continuing under the present circumstances.
pro	I'm voting to leave. The Eurozone is ready to implode and we would be best off distancing ourselves from the fallout. Remember the shit show about Greece defaulting on their debts? When Italy or Spain defaults(as they are likely to do) it will be a different story. In addition, I'm a believer in small government. The further away from the common man our leaders are, the more complacent they will become. Getting rid of the EU seems a good way to even the odds
anti	I'm voting to remain because what they have done to are fishing industry...Oh and for mobile roaming charges
anti	I'm voting to remain.
anti	I'm voting to remain. Kyle doesn't seem to be aware of the racist propaganda the leave side have used to stir up hatred and touch the hearts of far right Nazi's.
anti	I'm voting to stay in the EU. These heroes you list. They're all from a different era. If you compare modern Britain to the Britain they lived in we are have fallen behind. We don't have any innovators. All we have are idiots like Cameron and Farrage and Co. Those heroes had a high degree of selflessness and humanity, which is lacking in today's leaders. Churchill and the rest weren't perfect, but their like have gone and won't be seen again. People who think we are still like those heroes are living in a fantasy world.
pro	I'm with a Free Britain. üá¨üáßüá¨üáßüá¨üáßüá¨üáß
pro	I'm with the out group we spend to much money on the EU and why should we be dictated to by Germany we won the war and they are now telling us what to do and we do not want any more immigrants here we can't cope with what we have and our NHS is crumbling because it's being abused I Want Out
pro	I'm with them, but think we are headed for no Brexit and some real anger from the 17.4-million, it's a stitch up, the greatest betrayal of all time.
anti	I'm wondering what many Leavers think abt this now, especially since a lot more info abt the real consequences is out. Oh, also, since the rich Leavers have been taking their business elsewhere etc
anti	I'm worried about the prospect of a Micheal Gove, Boris Johnson, Iain Duncan Smith, Daniel Hannan and possibly Nigel Farage government being elected if we leave. That would be a disaster of epic proportions!
pro	I'm worried that 'crime is easier to deal with' ignores the fact the EU has made crime easier in the first place (the terrorists atrocities for example)
anti	I've already had the most precious of gifts from Brexit - realising my parents are racists. They kept it hidden for a long time but thanks to Brexit, it's been pulled out into the sun. They alienated almost all of their kids and grandkids with their political rants on Facebook, it's been really hard to deal with. You think that someone is kind, generous and fair but then it turns out that it only applies to British people, preferably not Irish, and definitely not Romanians or Poles. Thanks Brexit!
anti	I've always voted labour and I'm an ex trade union official but I will never vote labour again unless they try and stop brexit.
anti	I've been asking those people I know who voted for Brexit almost every day now for the last three years, to give me just one practical example of how their every day lives will be better as a result. I'm still listening to their silence.
pro	I've been clear that Brexit means Brexit.
anti	I've been feeling rather ashamed of my own country for quite some time now
pro	I've been wondering why UK is a member of EU for a long time.
pro	I've come to the conclusion that despite all the evidence to the contrary that Britain will be a country to be proud of once again, remainers will continue in this vein because they are followers, never leaders. They are suspicious of anyone who is successful and optimistic. Their misery prevails as it doesn't entail any effort on their part. The continual same old comments show a repeated mantra as they can only copy each other.
anti	I've from UK and just voted to remain today and to say thank you TYT support.
anti	I've got one they can have for free: #StopBrexit.
anti	I've had my Europeaness taken away
pro	I've just never been prouder of my country... Brexit day is about celebrating not just Brexit it's about celebrating democracy. It's alive and well and kicking in Britain.
pro	"I've lived my early life in a Communist country, a former Soviet republic and I notice a hell of a lot of parallels with the EU today. The EU seems to think that modern communism is the answer. Taking money from ""rich"" countries and redistributing it to the ""poor"" countries. I for one do not relish the idea of paying for poor Romanians (yes I'm evil I hate moochers, I don't care if they're poor I don't want my money going to help them I want it to help my own countrymen), or the billions that Poland gets (incidentally Poland is not a poor country yet receives shit-tons of money from the EU for some reason despite having better infrastructure than most member states) and then you have to accept foreign workers that work for less money and put you out of a job (yeah don't tell me it doesn't happen or that we don't want dem jobs etc). The USSR was one giant country. The EU is quite close to that definition and the way that some people in here and /r/europe talk it seems they want this as well. They want to erase their national identity. They want their money taken from them and handed over to French farmers who don't do anything, or to make Poland better while other member states roads and infrastructure crumble due to lack of investment. Why does anyone want a federal state? Why does anyone want to erase national identity? Why does anyone want to take on millions of economic migrants (yes, they aren't refugees - [even the EU said so] (http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/six-out-of-10-migrants-to-europe-come-for-economic-reasons-and-are-not-refugees-eu-vice-president-a6836306.html) so please explain pro-eu people why you want this ? Why do you want a federal state ? do you think it would be better than your own government ? Why do you want a drunk as your leader? Who spends thousands on expensive wines and slaps people in the face while he's drunk ? Why do you want your wealth redistributed to supposedly ""poor"" countries? Why do you want everyone to use the same dodgy currency that constantly needs bailing out ? Why do you want protectionism that means you end up paying more for stuff just so a bunch of Germans get to keep selling you appliances that break down in 2 years? I'm proud to now be a British citizen, and I'm proud to be a brexiter as well. I have three degrees and I'm not stupid and I'm not racist or xenophobic either. Why must remainers label everyone as such ? It's a straw man right ? I don't get it."
anti	I've never felt so useless or ashamed or saddened by the nation in which I was born. I am a citizen of the EU and I am about to be stripped of that citizenship against my will.
anti	I've never seen or met a brexiteer that doesn't seem... off..
anti	I've never seen so many people celebrating the loss of privileges.
pro	I've said it before and I'll say it again! The EU are scared to death of us leaving them and that's why they're being such a pain. Get up, walk out and loads of other countries will then follow. They haven't got the bottle to do it themselves but will do it after we've done all the hard work. About time you got tough TM but at last you are doing something!
anti	I've said it since the vote in 2016 I believe Brexit will lead to the break up of Britain Scotland and northern Ireland will leave Britain and I don't see Brexit ending well for anyone but its democracy so we need to except the vote and move forward I hope Brexit works out but I don't think it will unfortunately.
anti	I've seen how the EU tackles tax evasion versus the US ‚Äì and if Brexit Britain follows Trump, we're headed for disaster
anti	I've spoken to a hell of a lot of Brexit supporters and have yet to hear a single well thought out and reasonable argument about the benefits of leaving the EU. So far I have seen only ignorance, arrogance or bigotry from them. What we're going to lose and the struggle we'll all now face with higher taxes, fewer job opportunities, expensive holidays and inevitable increases to the cost of living, are not worth the risk. We've just sold our democracy to the Tories, who were already on their way to destroying it and now can complete their task.
anti	I've talked to my SO's family from the UK (he immigrated as a child and most of his family still lives there). They have all stated they are incredibly worried about the economic impact that leaving the EU would have.
anti	I've voting remain. Yes europe is a clusterfuck but the problems it has can be solved, and the problems we will get if we leave will not be. I have real issues with Brussels, but the good outweighs the bad. Also i hate this whole fucking immigration scare tactic. Even if i was super anti-immigration, the whole syrian refugee flood is a bullshit scare tactic. Do people forget we have the channel anyway? Also we guard the french side of the border in a special deal we have with them. We could lose that anyway. I wouldn't be surprised if immigration become WORSE by leaving. And if you worry about EU immigration? Well i guess the 2 million+ UK citizens leaving in spain and france better head home then.
pro	I've waited 47 years for this event, BRING IT ON! :-)
anti	"I've yet to hear a valid reason from the Brexit side for us leaving the EU. All their arguments are rooted in Xenophobia, Racism and ""Little eNglander""attitudes. It would absolute folly to leave..renegotiate yes...leave no."
anti	I+B69 can't believe the idiocy of this argument, that recession, slow growth, ineffective monetary policy and beaten down banks have been around for so long that they could not have anything to do with Brexit. You are like a doctor saying to the heart attack patient that your heart block is not because of your heart attack, because both heart attacks and cholesterol in your arteries have been around for a long time. The logic is so stupid I cannot find words to express the sheer ignorance of it. THE ECONOMY IS CYCLICAL, PROBLEMS GET BETTER AND WORSE ACCORDING TO ECONOMIC DECISIONS AND BEHAVIOUR. WHAT IS IN QUESTION WITH BREXIT IS CAUSATION OF THE SINGLE INSTANCE OR TREND RELATED TO THESE ISSUES AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT.
anti	I,m a European ,and I think the EU needs Britain ,and Britain needs the EU .
anti	IF UK leaves the EU a lot of Jobs there (in Finance etc) will be destroyed! Phuu...so or so UK is in a BAD situation!
anti	"IF an idea of single entity having much better position on international market is ""fine""', then we should reform the EU (something that many countries call for). I don't see how that argument works for leaving EU completely"
pro	INDEPENDENCE IS OURS
pro	IT TOOK THEM LONG ENOUGH TO LISTEN GET ON WITH √åT CAN WE LEAVE NOW
pro	IT'S NOT A HARD BREXIT IT'S A CLEAN BREXIT
anti	ITS NOT LEGALLY POSSIBLE TO TRADE ON WTO TERMS ON A CRASHOUT BREXIT...
pro	ITS OK TO BE INDEPENDANT !!!!!! MY UK IS AND WILL BE GREAT AGAIN !!!!
anti	Idea: Introduce a referendum to get rid of Brexit
anti	Ideally MEPs should vote against this as the British people haven't yet had a free fair,safe,legitimate Referendum on whether to Remain in or Leave the EU!The EU Referendum in 2016 was very close, extremely corrupted, unsafe and illegitimate & we shouldn't be leaving the EU on the basis of that corrupted vote! Vote Leave and Leave.EU broke our Laws including huge overspending in regulated period!
anti	"Idiocracy is ensuing. People who knew jackshit about the complexity of how the world runs were given a say in the matters they knew nothing about. Moreover, they will label anyone who's trying to feed information to their empty heads as having an agenda. Direct democracy is a form of mob rule where the mob will do everything which ""feels"" right rather than what the reality at hand indicates."
anti	Idiot Brexiteers heading for the biggest surprise in their stupid lives. Watch the coming months...
anti	Idiots celebrating like if they won a war or sth lmao.
pro	Idiots, I voted for Brexit. Strange how people can't deal with reality without fitting everything into narratives, it shows ignorance in their worldview
anti	If Brexit happens, and it looks like it will, I will forever blame @UKLabour because it has the opportunity to stop but they don‚Äôt want to.
anti	If Brexit happens, it will be a disaster.
anti	If Brexit is not carried out only people who believe immigration causes all our problems and rich unaffected by Brexit people should riot, good honest caring people would be celebrating if we remain.
anti	If Brexit is so great why are there no Brexit leaders willing to lead. It's seems they all know it would be the end of their political careers if they had to be PM during a hard exit...ergo,May is still in power.
anti	If Brexit is so great, how come *all those* billionaires who bankrolled it aren't doing it?
pro	If Brexit means an extra ¬£10-12 a month on my ¬£100 shopping bill, it's worth it as long as we get out of Europe. They don't care about us.
pro	If Brexit will help then change and adapt then that is a good thing
anti	If Brexit wins, having a dual-nationality will come in handy.
anti	If Brexiteers want my support then give me a serious upside in the form of far reaching and progressive reform
pro	If Brit has to choose between EU and an active volcano, it sould choose active volcano. EU is pure sh**
anti	If Britain leaves the EU then Scotland should do another referundum on leaving Britain
anti	If Britain leaves the EU, it will sink like an anchor. Because of borders, Northern Ireland will likely vote to leave the UK and rejoin Ireland, Scotland may vote again to leave the UK too and rejoin the EU.
pro	If Britain leaving weakens the German Empire, then Russia is pleased. But that is not a bad thing - the German Empire antagonising Russia is dangerous and perhaps an internally weak EU would be less aggressive. Either way, it would be better for us to not be entangled in such things.
pro	If Britain must choose between Europe and the open sea, She must choose the open sea!
pro	If Britain so badly needed skilled workers, why would the workers have to be immigrants
anti	If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will be a relative economic disaster for us all. The only way for those of us who remember life outside the EU to show you, is for the millions who dont know to vote to leave!
anti	If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will be a relative economic disaster for us all. The only way for those of us who remember life outside the EU to show you, is for the millions who dont know to vote to leave! Go for it. Theres no way back. And as many of us have been saying, with a certain amount of inside 'info', EU businesses employing UK citizens WILL relocate. Hundreds of thousands of jobs lost. Do this referendum soon. Then Cameron will have to shoulder the mess. Along with us.
anti	If Britain wanted the same benefits as a member state, all you had to do was remaining a member state. No you're out and you'll NEVER have those benefits again.
anti	If British exit it will be sink or swim time, they'd be far better staying put and have Germany guide them. Don't cut the hand that feeds you.
pro	If Cameron is unable to renegotiate Britain's terms of membership under the EU, I fear I may have do the previously unthinkable and vote for a Brexit.
anti	If EU approves the deal UK can continue to be an island nation. But remember, the time of the empire has passed
pro	If England is smart, they will send 20,000 troops into Scotland to dissuade them from the Independence referendum. Britain must act the part of an Empire again.
pro	If England should chose between Europe and the High seas she should always chose the high seas a quote from Winston Churchill weal always bounce back because were English it's what we do
anti	If England wanted a say to what happens in Europe they lost it now. Like Oliver's point here, if they hate the EU they'd be better off having a seat at the EU decision maker's table and not leaving all of Europe to be decided by the French and the Germans. They'd be fools to think what happens in Europe won't effect them in Britian.
anti	If England won't take the refuges. Ireland will. We will take as many as we can. Disgraceful behaviour England. Just ridiculous. To the people who thought of only themselves Inhuman to have torn and broken people to leave.
pro	If European countries have any sense they will all be voting for their own exits, before Brussels eradicates the indigenous populations with Arficans and Muslims from the 3rd world.
anti	If I remember my History wasn't it Churchill who encouraged and recommended a United Europe with a United army?
pro	If I thought there was any chance of major reform in the EU,I'd vote to stay in.But there isn't.Sad.Sorry,Paddy.
anti	If I vote remain tomorrow, and Britain stays in an increasingly authoritarian EU, I can just about live with myself. If I vote leave tomorrow, and Britain becomes even more of a Tory dystopia without the EU, I don‚Äôt think I can live with myself. So, for that reason, I‚Äôm sticking with remain.
pro	If I wasn't a Brexiteer before watching #InsideEurope I would be after watching it. Without exception, the EU leaders come across as arrogant, bullying, and scornful of Britain.
pro	If I were a British citizen I would vote to leave. The EU is a anti-democratic, bureaucratic monstrosity that only serves itself. It is filled with failed politicians who are paid huge sums of money to do nothing but fill their pockets. The only thing we need in Europe is free trade. Brussels in its current form needs to go down.
anti	If James Bond says remain, who are we to disagree! #StrongerIn #VoteRemain
pro	If Johnson gets this right, we could be seeing the start of putting the Great back into Great Britain. For all its people.
anti	If May cared about Britain she would so the right thing and put the question back to us in a People's Vote. Jeremy should stop associating with and enabling her. She is as toxic as Brexit itself.
pro	If UK citizens voted to leave EU, isn‚Äôt anti democratic not do to so?
anti	"If UK wants to stay in a premier world league VOTE REMAIN. If the UK wants to shrink to a minor league with an OAP ruler practicing medieval ways . then VOTE LEAVE. .....AS for ""Rule Britannia"" .. there will be nothing to rule. But like the British Empire Ur ship is sinking. Does Ur OAP ruler care ??. not one bit .She has said and done nothing .. go racing at Ascot .YES"
pro	If a Brexit brings about the end of the EU as we know it ,so much the better for all 300 million plus European citizens.
anti	If a leadership or coach (UK government) of football team is bad you don't step out the competition(EU)! You must kick out the management but not step out of the competition(EU) or breakup the team(UK). The UK people has turned her anger against themselves instated of the people that harm your county.
anti	If a no deal `hard‚Äô Brexit is coming, then the only good thing we can look forward to is the permanent destruction of the Conservative & Unionist Party.
pro	If a second referendum is called i will vote leave again, but only so the remainers don't win but then im finished ever voting again because there would be little point if there is no democracy and any vote i win called be asked to do it again and again.
pro	If all negotiations and decisions in the EU involve this kind of bluff, bluster and brinkmanship, I think membership sounds like a nightmare, and we had better leave. What a horrible 'club'!
pro	If all negotiations and decisions in the EU involve this kind of bluff, bluster and¬†brinkmanship,¬†I think membership sounds like a nightmare, and we had better leave. What a horrible 'club'!
anti	If anyone calls this Independence Day I will kick you in the teeth with the strength of all the countries the British empire colonised
pro	If anyone ever asks you why you supported Brexit, just ask them who they voted for as their European Commissioner.
pro	"If anyone thinks this is a bad thing just know that police are beating firefighters in the streets of ""Ol' Pierrie"" right now. Total media blackout on major news channels on where the EU is going."
anti	If confirmed, this would represent deeply troubling news for the north east economy
anti	If every single Remainer in London could spare 15 minutes outside parliament with us it would be formidable! #NoBrexit #RevokeA50 let's be sensible and not destroy our country #Remain!
anti	If everyone spoke the truth and listend to i. Then things would have been different. Worst thing in brexit is the murder of a politician and a journalist.
pro	If feels like working for a horrible boss and being giving the opportunity to go self employed...you‚Äôd be scared at first but an amazing chance to be happy and more successful
anti	If folks would stop marrying their cousins perhaps things like Brexit would not happen in Britain and elsewhere. Now that they have thought about it a little bit, why not hold a special vote asking if everyone is sure they want to exit the EU?
pro	If in doubt, vote out
anti	If intelligent people with experience and insight are to be believed GDP, National Debt, Poverty, Zero Hours Contracts, Employment Rights, Unemployment (the real sort, not the comedy figures BloJo proports) are going to get a lot worse over the next few years. Still, at least we got blue passports and have enough control that we can only blame ourselves for the forthcoming clusterfuck. Unless it's all the EU's fault, like before.
anti	If it ain't broke don't Brexit.
pro	If it does nothing else, this encapsulates all the reasons why we must leave on March 29th. A more malign and malevolent group of European¬† bureaucrats¬† would be very hard to imagine. Beyond our departure date, how will any British negotiator be able to view such people with anything other than extreme revulsion.
pro	If it doesn't go well I'll hold my hands up and say I overestimated the power of the UK, but I still genuinely believe we are large enough and influential enough for this to be the success that it could be
pro	If it means we can go back to using decent lightbulbs and choose high-powered hairdryers and vacuum cleaners if we so wish, I'm joining Brexit for sure
anti	If it were up to me, the UK would remain in a reformed EU.
pro	If it's a No Deal Brexit it can only be the remainers rioting cos all the leavers will be partying lol.
anti	If it's not about money, why do brexiters still hide behind 'project fear' with the announcement of every valid economic warning ? The truth is that leave voters aren't prepared to pay the true cost of brexit and never have been.
pro	If its this hard to leave now it will be impossible to leave in the future, once thats the case we will have lost our sovereignty. Time to leave now.
anti	If just one of these deportees are not a criminal and are merely being got rid of because of dog whistle politics by this hard right, populist government, they will have more to answer to than opposition front benches. Is this another reason why Johnson wants the EHRC dropped from the statute books?
anti	If manufacturing companies knew they would have to pay heavy import duties they might think twice about Brexit.
anti	If no deal means turning everything upside down as would happen with Brexit, then it's not better, it's tragic.
anti	If one positive thing came out of Brexit is, as a European resident in the UK, that through twitter and in real life I got to know a lot of amazing British people who serve as a reminder that the UK is more than the troglodytes it kept sending to the to the European parliament. Love from a Franco-British
pro	If one thing has come out of Brexit it is that the younger generation and their supporters like me really have a chance to make it work as a system.
pro	If only eu doesn‚Äôt have that stupid free movement and refugee law
pro	"If only the ""Remains"" had enough, honest and open education - and true knowledge of the dictatorial EU and unelected bureaucrats, ,many ""Remains"" would have voted to leave!"
anti	If only we could forget brexit, then it could be the gift that keeps on giving money and human rights
anti	If our goods don‚Äôt comply with EU standards they won‚Äôt buy them. It‚Äôs hardly rocket science!
anti	If our standards will always be higher, why not align with the EU to save British businesses and farming ?
pro	If over 350,000 is the net increase in the population can some one tell me how many British skilled people left Britain and how Many unskilled people arrive in Britain, because going on statistics the Government gives out it is closer to one Million unskilled people arriving in Britain every year. VOTE TO LEAVE
pro	If people didn't bother to vote when they had the opportunity, tough
pro	If remain win, it's will be the saddest day in UK's history!!!!!!!
anti	If some 12 to 24 months from now we find the country is doing very well, we have great new trade deals and are at least as well off, let alone doing better, I will very happily come on these pages and admit that I was wrong and you Brexiters were right.
pro	If the EU can't come to a trade agreement before the end of 2020.. no problem. The UK can move ahead with trade deals world wide, and the EU can come back to the UK when they are ready.
pro	If the EU don't want to deal respect their decision and look to others who do stop wasting time close the door and open another one just walk away.
pro	If the EU drained the swamp, brought in more democratic decision making, and barred leaders of countries allowing in mass migration, then I would vote to remain or stop Brexit.
anti	If the EU have signed it without crying about it then I'm afraid that cannot be good for the UK. No chance. Something fishy is going on.The third turd now signed.
anti	If the EU is so bad then how come only a tiny minority of our parliment wants to vote leave?
pro	If the EU is so successful why is it so afraid of competition? The EU has suffocated creativity and innovation in Europe and wants to ensure that we are trapped in their sphere of decline. Not one of the world's top 20 tech companies is European - even the Israelis are far ahead of European on tech development. Boris must ensure that we leave the EU graveyard and are free to rejoin the world of the living.
pro	If the EU refuses to renegotiate or even discuss amendments to the backstop, then that proves that the Eurosceptics were correct and that the backstop was designed to keep the UK locked into the EU forever. They don't want us to leave because too many EU jobs depend on the UK. They also need our contributions to keep the Eastern Block happy spending our money. They can also use our money to build their Super state. Let Juncker, Macron, Merkel and Tusk explain to the rest of the EU why their intransigence has cost the ¬£39 Billion. That is a hell of a price to 'punish' the UK!
pro	If the EU wish to level THEIR playing field to match ours, that's up to them. But the days of telling us what to do are over.
anti	If the Labor Party wasn‚Äôt led by a colorless incompetent and the Liberal party was‚Äôt lead by another boring incompetent, these two parties could have joined forces to build strong support to stay in the EU. ¬† In their ineptitude, they actually colluded with Johnson and his fellow Brexiters. Unfortunately, the Democrats like the two ‚Äúopposition‚Äù British parties may be put up a candidate who will allow the sociopath to continue his autocratic reign.
anti	If the UK actually leaves the EU, then it‚Äôs going to take longer than a decade for any kind of trust to be re-established, if ever. So re-admittance at any level will take several decades to achieve.
pro	If the UK does not leave the EU, it will demonstrate democracy in the UK and the EU is a farce, it's fake, an illusion, no better than North Korea !
pro	If the UK goes back to its old ties, a CANZUK trading block would be able to hold its own with the other global superpowers.
anti	If the UK leaves the EU, Northern Ireland will leave the Union of the UK for Ireland and Scotland becomes independent. The UK will cease to exist, all that will remain is England+Wales.
anti	If the UK leaves without a deal and in essence renege on its good friday agreement commitments, an international treaty, who on earth is going to trade deals with the UK?
anti	If the UK votes to leave the EU then Scotland, Wales and NI should all leave the UK and let England go its own mad way.
pro	If the UK wants to remove itself from the EU, then that's just one population group that isn't having its policy dictated by some large overlord government.
pro	If the UK wasn't stripped of assets and industry being sold off we would of kept our independence. The country has turned into a free for all camp site for everyone around the world. It's not been respected nor treated and looked after like a home. The new breed of soft headed snowflakes have crippled the country. Mainly because less important things have been made a priority. Bring back tradition culture and disapline and make it a democracy again. We the people/tax payer tell you what to do. The government isn't to tell us what to do, we elect them we pay for them we own them. They should respect the English and their home. We don't go to other countries and do what they do yo us, they wouldn't tolerate it. It's all a mess and people in power DON'T have the best interests at heart. So this country WILL go down because corruption WON'T allow good to prevail. I'm English and my country is being turned into a world gateway and a business hub for other countries. My country is being stolen and given away. All those who died for our country and now it's for what????????? DISGUSTING AND SHAMEFULL our leaders should pay a penalty considering they don't hesitate to make the tax payer pay. It's treason it's betrayal it's deception. England should be England just like each other country should be it's own. After that we should continue to trade and work together. Simple without greed. News reporters and channels should give the truth but even you guys are bought, corrupt puppets being told what to do. So really there is no hope because your all full off utter shite and lies. People shall rise and wars shall happen. People will die and suffer all because the fat gits at the top don't care whilst hiding behind closed doors
anti	If the brits want to ruin their economy thats fine for them
pro	If the hard brexit happened northern Ireland might get freed and so might Scotland
pro	If the majority of you is against Brexit, I'm sorry but you just didn't show up when it counted. 56 % of British electors voted for opposition to Johnson -- sure, but many of those vote for Labour, and many of the Labout voters are pro-Brexit.
pro	If the remainers just hurry up and finish their tantrums, dry their eyes and get behind us putting Britain first, there‚Äôd be no reason why we can‚Äôt be a super power again
pro	If the two main political parties fail to deliver the Brexit we voted they will destroy themselves, I have repeatedly emailed my local MP and TM to say that I will not vote for them again if they fail to deliver the will of the majority of eligible voters which was to leave, deals were not on the ballot paper just leave or remain.
pro	If the uk leaves eu it will be pure bliss and brilliant for all uk citizens
anti	If the vote goes the Brexiteer‚Äôs way I firmly expect to be arrested on the march tomorrow. Never been charged with any criminal offence but i‚Äôm at breaking point and very little to lose - i think i‚Äôd be quite proud to be able to frame the charge sheet and show my future grandkids that i actually stood up for something.
anti	If there is a hard Brexit food prices will go up fore years to come.
pro	If there is another referendum and we don‚Äôt fully leave the EU at the end of everything then I‚Äôm not going to vote ever again! This country is corrupt.
pro	If there is any truth in that the Government are preparing to keep us in the Customs Union in order to save PMs deal. I will certainly vote against it. How can this be taking back contro
anti	If there was a second referendum, and the result was still to leave, that would be the winner for mass stupidity of the century, second to venezuela.
pro	If there was to be a second referendum, then it would be a betrayal of democracy. Just cause you didn't get the result you wanted, doesn't mean you can cry and want another till you get what you want.
pro	If these REMOANERS would negotiate half as hard with EU like they do against LABOUR and BREXITEERS the UK would be in better shape.
pro	If these foreigners worry so much about a 'No deal' and Britain's economy, then why are they so demanding and rigid in their negotiations with us. It doesn't add up does it?
pro	If these people love the EU so much then go live in Europe..problem solved..bye
anti	If they cared about what is right for the country they wouldnt be backing Brexit
anti	If they wanted to leave EU that's ok but Brits should be greatful to be part of EU, without it they would be much much poorer now
anti	If they wanted to sort immigration out why have they done nothing about non-EU immigration the last 2 years?
anti	If they were stupid enough to vote conservative, they‚Äôre stupid enough to leave the EU. I live in a country of ignorant suicidal morons.
anti	If this is true, Brexit should be canceled and abolished right now.
anti	If this was truly supported by the country why isn't there a feeling of triumph, millions on the streets, street parties galore the red arrows, I'll tell you why... It's because this is a shit sandwich
anti	If this whole brexit BS has made me realise one thing, it's that I feel more European than British. This country and its 'leaders' are shameful.
pro	"If this woman doesn't understand why it is that people voted for Brexit....then prehaps she should look in the mirror. A complete ""let them eat cake"" attitude."
pro	If we Vote Leave we will be able to stop handing over so much money to the EU and we would be able to spend our money on priorities here in the UK
pro	If we are charitable, we could put this down to the EU's incomplete command of the English language. If not, it is yet another instance of their complete disregard and disrespect for us. The fact they don't seem to want to change it implies the latter ....
pro	If we are denied Brexit again I very much fear we will start to see violence.
pro	If we deny the people the opportunity to leave on 29th March, they‚Äôll never forgive us.
pro	If we didn‚Äôt have a transition period we would have crashed out which apart from a very small %of people no one wants. So yes we have to follow rules for 11 months, while we sort out a deal, I don‚Äôt see what the big deal is, and why those who clearly wanted remain are trying to turn this into a negative thing lol, they are getting a tissue to help dry those eyes until mommy and daddy‚Äôs divorce is final.
anti	If we do end up leaving (I'm still hopeful a second referendum will come) I can't wait to see what / who / how middle England blames all their problems on going forward. It's been forginers and the EU for decades, soon these bigoted pricks will have nobody else to blame except the government who have screwed them for decades. Shame they couldn't see that before we voted.
pro	If we don't get out now we will never get out ever again. When everyone realises that staying was the wrong decision, it'll be too late.
pro	If we don't leave the EU, it will only be a matter of time before it's businessmen-politicians in Brussels, who are only in it for the money and power, will be the ones sending our troops off to war.
pro	If we don't leave the EU, we should sack all the MP,s and the Lord's, they are no longer needed. The EU now makes all our laws so the MP,s are taking money on false pretenses. Aso we are now a rubbish dump for all the world's unemployables and gangster,s
pro	If we don't need a trade agreement with them don't bother wasting time negotiating one . Personally I'm sick of the EU and their mind games.
pro	If we don‚Äôt get out then it‚Äôs plan B: tear it up from the inside.
pro	If we don‚Äôt leave on the 31st then the UK would have signed away its Democracy, Sovereignty and Beliefs.
anti	If we exit, prepare to do worse.
pro	If we fail to leave I fear the country will move to the right.
pro	If we had had the right people in charge, instead of the craven bunch we did have we could have had this position sorted, done and dusted by now!
pro	If we had not joined we would still have a large fishing industry we would still have profitable coal industry and we would still have a steel industry, we would not have stupid rules like straight bananas and cucumbers
pro	If we leave on WTO they will soon come running to do a good deal. Yes we will suffer some short term pain but it will be worth it
pro	If we leave the EU we won't have to take the migrants that come in off the coast. Things will get more expensive which is good for the UK as we can earn a substantial amount of profit from things such as potatoes. Council taxes will be abolished and laws will become stricter, allowing the UK to have more power over itself. VOTE LEAVE. VOTE LEAVE. VOTE LEAVE
anti	If we leave the EU, I am moving to Mars.
pro	If we leave the EU, and eventually we realise it was a bad idea we will be able to rejoin. If we stay in, we will stay in until we are eventually annexed into the United States of Europe.
anti	If we leave the EU, the Italians will prohibit the sale of pizza in the UK #VoteRemain
pro	If we leave without a deal the EU will be responsible for the border in Ireland.
pro	If we really do leave without a deal, the Brussels will lose the 39 billion quid at a stroke. The EU seems to think it can play hardball with us while we are expected to behave like gentlemen.
anti	If we remain in the EU they'll unblock putlocker and add new shows on to Netflix #Voteremain
pro	If we remain in the European Union,then the UK‚Äôs relationship with democracy is over!
pro	If we stay in the EU and give more and more power to the EU over the UK then what? We would have the Germans, French and Dutch making decisions for us with their populations which together far outnumber the British.
pro	If we stay in the EU and our economy grows, our contribution to the EU coffers will grow too. Therefore leaving the EU will allow the UK to grow and reinvest in our own country.
pro	If we stay in... Forget about pensions ! Forget about the NHS ! With so many people on low wages there will be insufficient tax receipts. Our cherished system will be broken up and sold under the TTIP and practically everything will be privatised. The UK will become a broken two-tier state with the haves and the have-not, those that receive medical care through insurances and those that don't. We need to protect our economic and democratic rights as citizens. Vote OUT !
anti	If we truly voted Brexit why are you so scared of a second referendum?
anti	If we vote for Brexit it will only be a matter of time until at least half of the factories we see here are closed, relocated or downsized.?
pro	If we vote to leave then I think the union will be stronger.
pro	If we vote to stay in the EU, we will be effectively voting away our very right to vote!
pro	If we vote to stay, I will give up hope for this country
anti	If we were not part of the EU, we'd get no say whatsoever in EU-wide issues...that's a terrible position to be in.
pro	If we'd done that... we'd have an 80/20 outcome -- favouring CLEAN BREAK BREXIT.
anti	If you #GetBrexitDone via #NoDeal then there is NO SUCH THING as ‚Äúgetting it done‚Äù, as you STILL have to do a trade deal (which takes 10yrs) & even then you‚Äôd have no more bargaining chips! The UK would be utterly on the back foot! Poker players cannot raise AFTER they‚Äôve folded!
pro	If you accept democracy, then you must accept Leave won, end of...
anti	If you are celebrating this. Shame on you #BrexitCelebration
pro	If you are going to make a hash of these talks just go for a No Deal, its what a lot of us want ! No more pandering to EU Bullies Tess, we told them what we wanted & they as always said NO, also not one penny leaves The UK !!
anti	If you are in a club you get the benefits from being a member. If you leave the club you don't get those benefits. Get real leavers. Stop whinging - you voted for it.
anti	If you are wondering what Brexit will be like, just try imagining a perfect Christmas, but where you are the turkey.
pro	If you believe in Britain, vote leave
anti	If you believe in facts; in science; in #cleanenergy; in #climate change; vote Remain on 23 June
anti	If you believe in maternity leave for women, equal pay rights, free NHS, anti discrimination laws, social rights, #VoteRemain
pro	If you cant get the deals you want before its time to leave, thats a shame, but its time to LEAVE the EU
anti	If you care about BRITSH jobs, people, the economy and security VOTE REMAIN .
pro	If you couldn't make it to Parliament Square tonight and you're gutted to be missing out on the atmosphere, here you go. #brexitnight #BrexitCelebration
anti	If you fixed the bulb in your toilet you could still maintain the illusion that the sun never sets on the brutish empire.
anti	If you genuinely think leaving the EU by virtue of a 52-48 one-time non-legally binding public vote without any idea how things are going to be after you leave and still want all the good stuff that comes with being in the EU is a good idea, then I have some real estate on the far side of the moon I‚Äôd like to sell you.
pro	If you had to pay 80% of your income to a government that does nothing to fix crumbling hospitals, gives out early retirement pensions to 45 year olds, and tries to hire as many people to the public sector as possible to secure votes, wouldn't you try to avoid paying taxes also? This is the case in Greece my friends..
anti	If you happen to be a brexiter, enjoy the moment, because it will not last.
anti	If you have a trade mark, or a copy right, or even a patent, you don't have to take one out for each country. You can get one EU wide one for all 28 members.
anti	If you have free trade with the EU, you must abide by its regulations and rules. Otherwise you don't get free trade with the EU. Why is this so hard for Boris to understand?
pro	If you haven't already, make sure you go and @Vote_Leave this evening - every single vote brings us closer to breaking free from the EU.
anti	If you haven't yet voted in #EUref please vote for peace and unity. Please #VoteRemain
pro	If you look for excuses like nationalism then you will never understand why we voted for Brexit. It was a vote for DEMOCRACY.
anti	If you love chaos, leaving the European union is the plan.

anti	If you think about it #Brexit is an excellent weight loss program. Everyone in Britain is guaranteed to lose several pounds.
anti	If you think brexit will help workers you should resign your professorship Mark, you are right on a lot of things but not this for the UK.
anti	If you think you live in a democracy ,you're deluded.However,I hope it all works out without any problems, I just doubt it.Ireland's troubles are likely to restart and Scotland is likely to separate from the UK ,which will spell the end of the United Kingdom and if that happens what's left could easily slip in to obscurity.I hope none of this happens but votes have consequences and when only 2 of the 4 Kingdoms want to do something this fundamental to the country ,forcing the other 2 Kingdoms to go along, unrest is likely to ensue.When the UK joined the EU all the Kingdoms wanted it with a 62% vote for it ,now a little better than 50% vote in 2 of the Kingdoms and that is the end of the UK being in the EU,a recipe for disaster.
anti	If you vote out, you're literally no better than a neo-n a z i.
pro	If you voted remain your a traitor to your country and traitor to your people. If you love Europe so much go live there because I am not European I am British and will be governed by a foreign power.
anti	If you voted to leave and are over the age of 40 you might as well pack your shit to the U.S with Trump b.c its only a matter of time before your economy goes to shit and your baby boomers are crying for pension help.
anti	If you want a mandate for a hard Brexit, you‚Äôll have to go back and ask the people again, but you‚Äôre petrified to do that because you know full well what the answer would be.
anti	If you want a vision of the future of Brexit, imagine an island discovering that its own Government burned the lifeboats and destroyed all the lifejackets
anti	If you want it to #stopbrexit write to your MP. Express your concerns in the local papers. Talk to your friends and family and colleagues. You may be surprised they may agree with you. They may want a #FinalSay or they may want to #RevokeArticle50 before it‚Äôs too late.
anti	If you want the opportunity to travel,work &live in several other countries with ease, be able to trade within the Eu for free #VoteRemain
pro	If you want to live in the eu, go across the Channel & reside there instead - this is England
pro	If you want to make history & bring back democracy & economic prosperity in the long term #VoteLeave #euref
anti	If you would know European history, you would know the last decades have been the most peaceful decades in European history.
anti	If you wrote a book about the history of hypocrisy Brexit would need it's own standalone volume.
anti	If you're British and you haven't realized that Brexit is an attempt to isolate you from the protection of the EU so you can be put up on the auction block and sold, you're living in the same kind of delusion as trump supporters.
pro	If you're for Brexit, give a thumbs up. Brexit won the argument AGAIN. We are leaving.
pro	If you're going to vote out, please use a pen and not the pencils provided at the polling station. Papers were changed last time and they'll do anything they can to keep us in.
anti	"If you're having a ""Brexit party"" tonight, then you are deffo a nonce of the lowest order. Get fucked."
anti	If you're leaving, just leave. But don't try to drag others along the way
anti	Ikea has better cabinets.
pro	Ill be Voting Out.
pro	Im American. I would vote to leave too. Fk the EU
anti	Im British-Cuban ...but I don't want to leave EU...
pro	Im certainly looking forward to coming out of EU should of happened ages ago.
pro	Im certainly looking forward to coming out of EU should of happened ages ago. Take back our laws . Ship migrants where they come from. 1 comes over they bring there whole family to uk. Such a joke. Giving them homes before any of us who were born here. Jobs a real bad thing in warehouses and places like that there are more foreigners they speak there own languages and have no respect for the British. All they do is do take take take.
anti	Im from eu just moved here 3 months ago and started working. if there is no deal and I become ilegal what is uk suposed to do kick out 4 million people? It would be like the bigest ethnic clensing in modern history.
pro	Im fucking sick of these remainers asking for a second referendum, the queen has signed it off we are leaving get a grip you bellends üò´üò´üò´!!!
pro	Im glad the people in uk woke up
pro	Im loving this - Brexit - Trump re-election - the liberal left are being put to the sword all over the world - happy days !!

pro	Im so glad we are finally out. The eu is a broken mess. It doesn't work never has never will time to reforge our paths.
anti	"Im voting to remain because i done want the price of my Sainsburys taste the difference edam to go up 50p. The ""sovereignty"" you want back never belonged to you."
anti	Imagine #brexit being a #psychiatricdiagnosis (which it kind of is), today is a day when safeguarding would mean #sectioningtheuk against potential #harm to self/EU/others.... as it‚Äôs incapable of making rational decisions... & needs to stabilise
anti	"Imagine if intelligent and highly advanced extraterrestrials visited the Earth. It would be interesting to watch people trying to explain to the visitors why most humans feel that it is important for us all to live in separate and isolated little countries. Especially if the aliens ask ""But... aren't you all just one species, living on the same planet..?"" What answer would we give..?"
anti	Imagine if they atcually focused this energy on helping the poorest in the country instead of backing politicians who think they're a great
anti	Imagine voluntarily leaving the world's largest trading bloc.
pro	Imagine what we can become without the restrictive shackles of the EU holding us back.
anti	Immigrant making Britain GREAT since 1066, STOP Brexit
anti	Immigrants - we get the job done. Yes, immigration is *good*. #VoteRemain #ham4remain
pro	Immigrants arriving in Britain from the EU outnumbered Brits heading the other way by a 180,000 in 2016, placing unacceptable strains on housing, welfare and education.
pro	Immigrants landing on our beaches in boats, European organised crime operating in the UK already due to open border, jails packed with foreign criminals and the government is all of a sudden concerned.
pro	Immigration and Sovereignty...Leave Now!!
pro	Immigration. Needs to be stopped altogether. We are bursting at the seams to many have been let in. From January 2015 till now waiting list for doctors appointments. At my GPS surgery waiting time what once once 2 week wait is now 6 to 7 weeks. And when Turks get in it be even worser. We really do need OUT of the EU otherwise I can see that due to this overcrowding they will be lives at stake. But Cameron. Oblivious to all this he lives in a completely. Different world than us .. He destroying our country. PLEASE VOTE LEAVE .. Before its gets any worser
anti	Import duty can be increased up to 10 % from 0% depending on the tariff codes
anti	Important: Brexit's biggest disadvantage is that it's slowing the U.K.'s economic growth
pro	In 10 years, the EU will be taking loans from the UK. Prosperity dead ahead.
pro	In 15 or 20 years when this has become a massive success, the EU is floundering or has already ceased to exist I bet you won‚Äôt find a remoaner in sight. They‚Äôd be too embarrassed to admit they were one if the U.K. is booming again.
anti	In 15 years most of the brexiteers would be dead! It won't matter to them anyway.
anti	"In 1739, Sir Robert Walpole said ""They ring their bells now, but before long they will be wringing their hands""."
anti	In 1946 Britain's most famous son Winston Churchhill called for a United States of Europe. The man must be spinning in his grave.
anti	In 2 years time the UK will be begging to rejoin the EU.
pro	In 20 years time there won‚Äôt be an EU to join.
anti	In 2016, Brexit had 4 words: Leave the European Union. In 2019, Brexit has a 585-page treaty!
anti	In 5 -10 years time when the U.K. tanks we still won't admit Brexit was a bad idea. Ps Trump lol
pro	In 5 years there will be no EU
anti	In Brexit wonderland, the clearer something is, the more unsayable it becomes. The need to delay article 50 is obvious True! But it would be much better to cancel the whole 'shitshow' completely, and stay in the EU, wouldn't it?
anti	In a no-deal Brexit, Britain could also lose the continued access it has negotiated to European plane travel records and databases of vehicle registrations, fingerprints and DNA profiles. This is very bad.
anti	In a year from now when the pound may be worth less than 1 euro, and all things that are imported, fruit, food, oil, clothes,electronics etc etc will be more expensive....The people that voted for brexit may regret what they have done to england...It's still time to reverse the brexit but the time is running out. Why not vote a second time to be really sure?
anti	In a year the UK will extend their ‚Äútransition period‚Äù for another year. boris is a fool.
anti	In all of this campaign I haven't seen an argument for why I should vote to leave. Why would leaving be an improvement to the current situation? We will re-nogotiate a trading deal with Europe - Already have one so no improvement. We will save c¬£9bn we pay to EU - Total government spending is c¬£700bn, I can see the saving is a benefit but not a big one in the national scheme of things and I'm not sure that leaving won't end up costing us at least that in uncertain inward investment. Border controls - In my experience being able to have people move around EU (both in and out the UK) has been a great benefit. Many businesses I have worked for and with have seen this ability as a positive. Making that more difficult is a negative in my eyes (plus evidence that tax take > spending for immigrants) Sovereignty - We already have that and the bits we have pooled with the EU are beneficial. I haven't seen an argument which details how the UK will be better by taking back our sovereignty 100% I'm happy to read more about it and I'm open minded but the leave campaign have completely failed to sell me a positive reason to change.
anti	In case anyone has forgotten the claims made by the leave campaign. The lies for which we have sacrificed our and our children‚Äôs rights as European Citizens.
pro	In comparison to the United States we don't share a common past and we don't have a single flag to be proud of. There's too much rivalry and suspicion between countries.
pro	In decades to come, 31st January will be celebrated as the day Britain was saved. It took a fight, but democracy has finally prevailed. Happy Independence Day!
anti	In every Brexiteer comment I read, I'm sensing panic. I think most of them realize they did something very very damaging to the UK but, in true human nature, are now hell bent on pretending they didn't. That is why there is so much abuse being thrown at those who did not vote for Brexit.
pro	In fact go watch Brexit the movie I can't be arsed explaining in full how the EU has turned its back on the UK but still expects us to lube up an take a shafting every time another failing EU economy needs a bailout to the tune of billions.
anti	In fact, leaked documents suggest that Theresa May‚Äôs government planned to ‚Äúscale down‚Äù climate and environmental protection
anti	In fairness the media have a dilemma - all the facts so far show that Brexit is a massive mistake and will seriously damage this country and our lives (and our children's) for decades.
pro	In like 50 or 80 years the UK would have become but a state in the EU.
anti	In my complete sadness, the yobbish mentality that seems to have saturated the U.K. seemed to be everywhere, whist they celebrated and let off fireworks I feel I‚Äôm mourning the loss of a very close and much loved friend. My stability is shaken and I feel isolated from the country I must call home.
anti	In my humble opinion Brexit is the single most stupid adventure besides the middle eastern wars any western country has thrown herself into in the course of the 21. century.
anti	In my opinion I think we shouldn't leave the EU
anti	In my opinion brexit is a lose-lose situation for everyone. ..
anti	In my opinion brexit is a lose-lose situation for everyone. ...
pro	In my opinion we all might take a hit at first. But Brexit is a process and the mistake is to assume things won't get better in the long run. In the long run, it's my belief that our economy will improve significantly.
pro	In my opinion, British will exit the EU. British are very pompous and arrogant people
anti	In my view, Brexit for a while was the stupidest decision in a free election or referendum since 30 January 1933.
pro	In one sense it's awful, but in another, Britain needs to learn a little humility. We are a titchy country, not an imperialist power. It's time we behaved like it. Brexit will enable that.
anti	In our opinion, Britain can find a lot of resources and economic aid in the EU and above all, it could also be an economic aid for us. So in conclusion, leaving the EU would be a big mistake for the UK and a great loss for the EU member states.
anti	In principle, I am a remainer, and do not support the UK leaving the European Union.
pro	In principle, a united Europe sounds great to me. But in execution, the current version stinks like a dead pig. Europe has weakened itself by allowing risky nations to apply for membership.
anti	In short there are no benefits to Brexit except for the rich getting richer. So if you're rich, yay you!
pro	In short, I approve. But I also appreciate the controversy. It‚Äôs a big deal for not just the UK, but for the entire EU. But this is how democracy works. The people have spoken, and they have their reasons‚Äîsecurity and sovereignty in particular. I stand with those who voted for Brexit and with their reasoning; but for those that voted against it, I recognize the tremendous and frightening change that comes with it, and the implications for the economy. I am also disappointed in how the EU has tried to manipulate the UK political process and force a deal that is likely *not* what the people voted for. It‚Äôs time for the EU to genuinely acknowledge the UK‚Äôs sovereign choice as a nation, and start negotiating with them from that starting point, instead of trying to undo and undermine what‚Äôs done. It is also time for them to really try to understand why the voters chose Brexit, and deal with the underlying issues that led to it. Nobody is laughing. I have several Brit friends/colleagues, and I take this very seriously. You have been our allies for a very long time, and I hope that always remains the case.
anti	In so many ways cursed Brexit is causing this country immense damage right now, and why? To uphold the self congratulatory delusions of grandeur of a small gang of low grade MPs. (You know who they are.)
pro	In ten years time, when people see what is happening in a federalised Europe, they will be glad that we removed ourselves.
anti	In terms of labor mobility, being out of the EU is not as good as being in and there might be a few other issues.
pro	In the European Union, individual countries are not a problem, but the communist authorities :(
anti	In the UK and the US .... Putin's Plan is Working Fine.Just Fine!
anti	In the absence of an opposition worthy of the name it is absolutely crucial that papers like the Guardian hold this government to account. Brexit has given them carte blanche to do whatever they want and so far theyve been allowed to get away with it
pro	In the construction trade we're flooded with Eastern Europeans doing poor work for low money. It's constricting the industry and genuine builders can't get work as the Europeans are half the price.
pro	In the construction trade we're flooded with Eastern Europeans doing poor work for low money. It's constricting the industry and genuine builders can't get work as the Europeans are half the price. But they don't pay tax, mortgage, run families and cars and bills etc... they eat poorly and live badly so don't need the income to meet UK expected standards of living.
pro	In the early 70's I bought a house just on my one normal wage. I worked a 35hr. week, not one minute more. I brought up my family, had annual holiday, ran a car, on one normal wage, with no debt ever, accept my mortgage. Us workers had strong unions, we had immense power, were treated well, employers had to they needed us, no unlimited cheap foreign labour then. It's been 47yrs of decline for the working man. It's been little by little so most, especially younger people, haven't noticed. I voted Leave FOR young people, so they can have the life I've enjoyed.
anti	In the event we leave the EU and our economy and employment suffers we should sue those who ignored advice and drove us into a severe crisis
pro	In the future every citizen from Uk no longer has to give out of his own poket 200 euro to the EU budget
pro	In the long run Brexit gonna be good, be part and have to pay for other peoples bills gonna take germany economi down woth to much wellfair for to little people actualy working
anti	In the words of Michael Bloomberg, Brexit is the ‚Äústupidest thing any country has done besides Trump‚Äù.
pro	"In the words of my lovely grandmother, as she voted Brexit on her postal vote, ""It's not about my future, it's about yours"""
anti	In two years Theresa May has attended to the needs of only one group - the far-right hard Brexiteers like Johnson and Rees-Mogg. She has ignored all the rest - the 16 million who voted Remain, the millions who did not vote, the upcoming next generations and even the moderates in her own party. Is the survival of the Tory Party so much more important than the survival of the country? If the worst prime minister of any country in history had ever had a proper job, like, for example, that of a primary school teacher, then she would know that the easiest way to draw attention to yourself is to be a nuisance. Farage and UKIP were a nuisance - but small and ignorable until their tactics were copied by Rees-Mogg‚Äôs foul group, who learnt how to be nuisances themselves. Theresa May has shown herself to be just too weak, too stupid and too incompetent to slap down these unpatriotic, destructive nuisances. They have had her total attention, instead of being made to stand in the Naughty Corner.
pro	In war time we got supplies into the country as U Boats were sinking our shipping. We voted LEAVE and whatever that brings. LEAVE NOW.
anti	In what way did the EU restrict you exactly? By all measures it gave the UK citizens far more freedom.
pro	Increase the size of the Navy now, protect our waters as the French and Spanish don't let us fish in theirs. Stuff the EU, Britain comes first.
anti	Incredible to read the mind boggling stupidity of the Brexiters. The UK will leave without honouring its commitments and the world is going to rush to our door for the chance to trade ..... this is beyond stupid.
anti	Incredibly stupid, and an unprecedented act of self-harm. And I'm saying this as someone who's generally fairly Euroskeptic
anti	Incredibly stupid, and an unprecedented act of self-harm. And I'm saying this as someone who's generally fairly Euroskeptic, and would gladly see European countries develop an alternative and leave the EU behind.
anti	Indeed take a bow brexiters, you must be so proud. You will now have PM Boris Johnson to get a better deal than a truly respected statesman Cameron, good luck with that one... You must feel liberated now you will have 'control'... 1) The multi national companies making the DECISION to move their EU base from London and invest elsewhere - JP Morgan, Airbus and believe me many, many more to follow. 2) The EU having to TELL US what the leave terms are 3) Taking back our borders even though ANY trade deal must have freedom of movement. 4) Pensions that will face a decade of uncertainty as markets toil and the economy shrinks - just look at today's NEGATIVE CREDIT rating. 5) The prospect of the Scotland DECIDING to break up Great Britain. Thank goodness my children have a decade before they need to find work and I have many years before retirement. Great Britain, whatever that may look like in 5 years, faces a dark future. Will the last person to leave please turn out the lights.
anti	Indeed the main trait of Bojo‚Äôs personality is laziness so he had two options here:(1) work a lot for a deal that will not satisfy everybody in the Brexiter side...alienating some people from supporting him and his party. (2) or do nothing then blame the EU ( easy ) and satisfy and expand his political base...
anti	Indeed! Only a fool believes everything they read in the newspaper. Especially if that newspaper is the Mail, Telegraph, Sun or Express - all Tory rags pedalling fake news to the masses!
anti	Indeed, forget the Leaver doom and gloom, the prospects for the EU remains bright.
pro	Independence Day...UK will BE great again....!!!!!!!!!
pro	Independence day 29th march WTO terms
pro	Independence day has finally arrived in spite of the anti Democrats.
pro	Independence day has finally arrived in spite of the anti Democrats. Democracy won out. Good.
pro	Independence day! Brexit Day! We are free from the shackles, ready to rule the world
pro	Independence is the only way
anti	Independent Scotland coming well done brexiters
pro	Initially would be teething problems. Long term will be positive imo.
pro	Instead of being so condescending and childish, work on building our future positively. Stop giving Brexit a bad name.
pro	Instead of trading and cooperating with the other parts of the world, Europe wanted to close its doors on itself. Now, it is losing its members due to economical issues ... and I think Britain's exit is just a start .
pro	Insult us all you like. We are british. And we are leaving the EU.
anti	Intelligent people change their minds based on new facts and all the polls indicate that is what has happened.
pro	Interesting 'Values' the #EU is supporting, and let us not think that the construct is democratic, it is rules by #Berlin and #Paris, the rest are just spectators. #Brexit
anti	Interesting comments about being pushed around by the EU. Wait until we have a trade agreement with the US, then we'll see the true meaning of being pushed around!
pro	Interesting how not 1 of them mentioned any single specific thing the EU has done for the citizens of the EU states.
anti	"Interestingly, Brexitons rarely claim that they ""won"" fair and square. They merely bleat, incorrectly, that the Remain campaign also lied and overspent - in other words, ""We cheated better than you."" And they call that democracy."
anti	International banks and companies are already relocating their businesses to the EU, although it is not yet clear that there is a hard Brexit. Once the no deal brexit is determined, most international companies will leave your misty island and leave hundreds of thousands unemployed.¬†Brexiteers and thousands of trolls he pays to spread nonsense are Putin's useful idiots in destabilising Western democracies - first UK.
anti	Into the valley of economic suicide rode the Light in the Head Brexit Brigade!
anti	Invades half of the world and now has problems with immigrants.....
anti	Ireland will receive copious EU backhanders and so will not be crucified. Germany will now sell more cars to Japan, Canada & British Bankers relocated to Frankfurt. In fact replacing UK models with EU/Canada/Japan compliant models will increase profits per vehicle As has been said before, EU will catch the common cold, UK will catch double pneumonia
anti	Ironic that we leave at 11pm tonight because that's midnight in Europe. We're one hour behind. From tomorrow we'll be 50 years behind.
anti	Ironically London has to deal with the most immigration for the longest time and they voted to stay. So yes rest of England you are blaming all your problems on immigrants. They aren't taking your jobs. Jobs are being affected by a recession that England has only just come out of. Your solution was to exit the single market and put us back into it. I'm glad I moved to Asia and hope never to return.
anti	Is Airbus a threat? Is JLR a threat? Is Barclays a threat? Is Dyson a threat? Is EMA loss a threat? Is the @The_IoD known for lying? The relentless ignorance of you & Leavers is astonishing.
anti	Is Brexit done yet? Thought not.
anti	Is anyone sorting out another anti-brexit march? We need to get out into the streets of London again!
anti	Is it because they think they‚Äôre better than the rest of Europe? We‚Äôll see about that. Oh and they are NOT, by the way.
anti	Is it just me or are all the leave voters OAPs or people teens who do not know the repercussions of leaving?
anti	Is it this simple? May can‚Äôt blame the disaster on the people who caused the disaster because it would finish the party. So she‚Äôs conspiring with the people who caused the disaster to blame the disaster on the EU, secure in the support of media which helped cause the disaster.
anti	"Is it time for a ""told you so"" comment yet or are brexiteers still too occupied with the happy thoughts of no foreigners and blue passports....."
pro	Is the UK still Safer in after the #BrusselsAttacks http://bit.ly/IsUKSaferIn #Brussels #Brexit
anti	Is the vote of 2016 of ill informed people valid? NOW people are informed of what Brexit, its consequences and options mean.
anti	Is there anyone else who hates the fact we are leaving the EU today
anti	Is there not a TINY part of you, oh great architects of #Brexit, that thinks you just might have got this horribly wrong, that you might prove to be responsible for unprecedented misery and the sad demise of a country that, until you got your hands on it, was a force in Europe?
anti	Is there still HOPE for UK to stay in the EU
anti	Is this not what you voted for in the #EUREF? It‚Äôs too late to #StopBrexit, but it‚Äôs still ok to change your mind. Become a #RemainerNow and help #HoldThemToAccount
pro	Islam has a lot of hate and intolerance in it. No reason for the UK to instead pretend to love and tolerate it. Step 1 is Brexit. I hope they get their country back.
pro	Islamisation is the End of Europe and all of Europeans, through their indifference, are complicit. Because they abandoned their values ever since the ‚Äôcultural revolution‚Äô of the ‚Äô70s and raised their children with comfort as the only value, they‚Äôre now reaping the consequences. We‚Äôve made the wisest choice, thanks God Britain is out !
anti	Isn't funny how UK says EU bullys them and restricts them but when they turn around and do it to the Scots it's not seen as bullying and restricting Scots but their right on Scots? Aren't humans so predictably biased towards themselves without giving a thought to holding themselves accountable! It boils to one fact and all say it simply you cant keep shouting about rights of u dnt talk about your responsibilities! 20 century marked by nonsensical one sided conversation about all talking about their right but no one talking about responsibilities lying with each side of the argument! Thts the only bloody problem. Aim to strike a concious balance between rights and responsibilities and you will realize the world appears absolutely different. Being committed to reslove issues than being committed to be on the right on every effing thing!
pro	Isn't it amazing that you have accomplished in such a short time what Theresa May couldn't in years. You could tell she never supported #Brexit and didn't care what Brits wanted and voted for. Same in US with Democrats. Only President Trump has kept his promises. Why we love him
pro	Isn't it great to be the out of the EU ? Like having escaped alive from a burning building, we can now watch as it self-destructs from a safe distance.

anti	Isolation isn't good for children, inmates or countries
anti	Isolation never works
anti	It Is Sad That They Leave The EU, But It Is Their Own Decision.
anti	It all ends in no deal and bad relations with the eu and Ireland.
pro	It allows the UK economy to remake itself into a much more ¬ìUSA style¬î
anti	It appears that #BorisJohnson is getting cold feet over a no deal #Brexit. We told him and his #Brexiteer friends that it wouldn't work which is why he's having to back away. He'll have to give in over fisheries, free movement and on divergence. It's all falling apart.
anti	It baffles me how people can support what happened. Look at how much the value of the british pound dropped already. Look at all this trade that suffers. Is that really worth making the lives of immigrants harder? I dont think so. Britain's people chose xenophobia over their own interests.
anti	It baffles me why people who don't like the Guardian's political views take umbrage at them for having them. We get it, the Guardian is an elitist paper that doesn't listen to the British people. Thanks for that. Now toddle back to the Daily Mail and Sun websites where you can celebrate the rise of a new Britain with your peers.
pro	It better be at 23:00 on the 29th of March 2019 as promised by Theresa May. I want to wake up on the morning of the 30th March 2019 living in a free democratic country once again. NO more being controlled by those unelected eu bureaucrats we had for 47 years. That day will be OUR independence day!!
pro	It blows my mind how the Brexit debate is always framed as one of 'racism vs anti-racism' - the idea that if you believe Britain should leave the EU you're somehow racist and hate European cultures. Do these Remainers not understand that the EU is destroying the cultures it has assimilated? Do they not see that the EU represents an absolute dilution of dozens of cultures into one giant, bland, monolithic single culture with no nuances? If you care about cultures then you should be opposed to the EU. How on earth the EU managed to convince people it was on the side of cultures is beyond me. No wonder most Remainers tend to be the kind of people who believe in Identity Politics - they have to be obsessed with identity because they've pissed most of it away.
pro	It certainly was not when we were in the corrupt eu.
anti	It comforts me to know that however bad a day I have tomorrow, at least I‚Äôm not Boris Johnson.
pro	It didn't have to be this way; but the EU has now turned into a cult, supported by brainwashed acolytes who refuse to see what is happening. Their compound is rapidly being surrounded, yet their unelected leaders continue to convince them that all is well. The 29 March cannot come soon enough!
pro	It does make me laugh how they think they are so FREE within the EU. If a country wants to have a trade agreement with us they are told they aren't allowed to. How is that Freedom? Some un-elected Tosspot telling my country who I can and can't trade with. THANK GOD WE'RE OUT.
anti	It does not feel thought trough
anti	It does seem that the people of Britain have changed their minds and no longer want Brexit. Not to mention its implications for ordinary people - the NHS will go, for a start.
anti	It doesn't matter what is tabled, corbyn will be against it. There will be little progress and growing costs while that snake runs the Labour Party.
anti	It doesn't seem like ppl know why the UK joined the EU in the 70s.. It was simply because it's economy was failing, not to long after they joined it's economy started to pick up and now ppl want to leave how does that make sense??
pro	It doesn‚Äôt matter anymore BREXIT is happening whether you like it or not. Rule Britannia
pro	It doesn‚Äôt really matter, what matters is we are now governed by politicians who are actually accountable to the electorate, it‚Äôs called democracy. Unfortunately the EU is no longer a true democracy.
anti	It feels odd listening to educated people in background talking about leaving. and also disheartening. And blaming EU seems so odd
pro	It has been difficult for the EU to effectively resolve the immigration crisis, and immigrants will take up jobs and schools for British citizens. I support Brexit and we can control immigration.
anti	It has begun. Let it all crumble down. Burn to the ground in ashes and then rebuild. I warn ye.
pro	It has features very few people like (e.g. the unelected Commission and the parliament with little power, the fact that it is a mighty block with no foreign policy of its own).
anti	It has it's problems and has had for many years, but that is no reason to abandon the EU. The EU is as much about the future as the present, it is about what is best for this Country and our children and the EU holds the best prospects for both.
anti	It honestly never ceases to amaze me how this shit and Trump all happened in the same year.
anti	It is a catastrophe: economically, politically, socially.
anti	It is a foolish, damaging, blinkered idea that is being pushed by national saboteurs, who believe they see the opportunity to make money and grab power, and by the rabid right wing press, who play on fear and anger, to keep people divided and easy to distract.
anti	It is a foolish, damaging, blinkered idea that is being pushed by national saboteurs, who believe they see the opportunity to make money and grab power, and by the rabid right wing press, who play on fear and anger, to keep people divided and easy to distract. Sadly, the simplistic pro-Brexit arguments appealed to a lot of people who were looking for simplicity. Either yearning for long gone days of British supremacy, or looking for someone to blame for their own lives. 'It's the EU's fault that you're poor. It's immigrants' fault that you struggle to find a decent job. It's not the global financial system, exacerbated by the deliberate policy choices of the British government at all!'
anti	It is a genuinely dangerous situation. What happens when people actually do realize the cost of brexit, and rather than protecting institutions like the NHS, will likely destroy them. What happens when Labour's promises of rolling back austerity turn into ash as the UK government faces a serious post-brexit fiscal crisis?
pro	It is a great pity that the Remainers are incapable of seeing the aims of Brussels. It will be like the Jackboots over again just without them. Oh how I wish they would wake up.
anti	It is a mistake economically. That is obvious. Short and mid-term it will be very harmful and already is. The international reputation is already in tatters.
anti	It is a national tragedy that today the UK will leave the EU. I oppose it today for the same reasons I have always opposed it. Brexit is a con. A trick. A swindle. A fraud
anti	It is a national tragedy that today the UK will leave the EU. I oppose it today for the same reasons I have always opposed it. Brexit is a con. A trick. A swindle. A fraud.
pro	It is a real victory against the corporations, the globalists, and the muslims.
anti	It is a sad day for the UK
anti	It is a sad moment and I believe it is a loss both for Europe and for the UK.
anti	It is a sad moment for Europe. I can' t understand why somebody can hate so much his european civilization, european heritage, european culture, european ancestors, to do this. Perhaps we can talk about poverty, analphabetism, lack of school, lack of facilities, lack of future facilities, unmotivational life. Very strange for a country so called european.
anti	It is a shitshow, and there should never have been a referendum on this. The only reason David Cameron called one is because of stupid party politics, not for the good of the country or for democracy or anything like that. Most people don't know even nearly enough about the EU, how it works, how it benefits us, its long term strategies etc. People genuinely think that the EU 'controls' the UK and that unelected officials in Brussels make up laws and force us to adopt them, which is just utterly untrue. There is so much misinformation that it's scary - democracy is obviously a great thing, but only when the electorate actually have the facts, when the media is unbiased etc. As it stands, people are voting totally blind and ignorant. The EU does more for our country than our own government, particularly for the poorer areas. If the UK votes out, it means our government will lurch to the right. Even if you're not pro-EU, if you're not keen on the idea of a very right-wing era being ushered in, then vote remain.
anti	It is a sign of how far Britain has sunk that anyone would think the lazy, posturing nincompoop Johnson is a serious prime minister, let alone a potentially great one.
anti	It is a weakest decision Britain had done so far.
pro	It is a wonderful day and a new beginning. Looking forward to new civilized partnerships and future growth as an independent trading nation. Love you too x x
pro	It is about time you remainers see the true EuropeanUnion .IT is their way or no way.We need to stand as one against the none elected Bullies of Brussels.
pro	It is an absurd another referendum on the same shit. People already decided, you cucks!
anti	It is because ignorant voters like yourself have no idea how modern economies work, that we are in this mess.
pro	It is better to be alone than in an abusive relationship.
anti	It is clear that the world markets from Asia to the USA all genuinely think that not only will the UK be better off in a REMAIN, so will the global economy. They have no axe to grind in UK politics. They are looking at it dispassionately. Much as Europe irritates me sometimes, I am not voting to trash the UK and the global economy on the flimsy xenophobic ill-informed non-sense coming out of the leave camp. They cant even get the basic facts right and feel the need to exaggerate wildly about Turkey and UK contributions. If they want to leave, they can. They can go to Southampton and take a Ferry wherever they want, and they can take Nigel Barage with them.
anti	"It is easy to blame, it is harder to take responsibility for the future economic growth of a country without any real certainty. We have told our biggest and best trade partners to no longer trust us. We have told our own citizens that they will have to pay tariffs most likely or even duty on imports that they rely upon. ""Buy local!"" will be the cry, and that may have some good effects but with limited exports and looming disasters on car manufacturing, the economic model is not looking at all well. So blame everyone else and avoid media scrutiny. That should at least ensure the erosion in popularity is a little slower. But in the end, it creates an opportunity for the Opposition to organise properly this time. We will need a healthy dose of reconstruction after this fiasco has played out."
pro	It is far more likely that our growth will exceed the 1.5% they attribute to signing up to Mendacious May's Appeasement of the EU.
pro	It is getting tiresome, listening to people telling me what I did and didnt vote for, when I voted leave. Some of us have these things called principles. I voted to LEAVE, if that means we are poorer in the short term then so be it.
pro	It is good to see an academic who tries to balance the Armageddon prophecies of the Remain propagandists. We now need a paper laying out the psychological effect of freeing ourselves from the bureaucratic, moribund EU.
pro	It is highly desirable therefore to free ourselves up to trade with the rest of the world which is growing more rapidly.
anti	It is impossible for me, a well travelled, cosmopolitan, European to understand how so many people have been taken in by so many transparent lies. To comprehend how other intelligent individuals cannot see through the deceipt and the corruption.
anti	It is just a new way to blame the UK problem on the EU. Now the EU is so cruel and arrogant cause of not renegotiate backstop what is already agreed on. They simply can‚Äôt do that. If u crash, they will tell u the EU is playing unfair so u can‚Äôt get trade deals, it‚Äôs all just for political gain.
anti	"It is manifestly ""wrong"" because it makes no sense, it doesn't solve their problems, it doesn't give them any more ""sovereignty"", it gives more power and influence to the very people who make their lives hell and the whole nation will pay for it for decades of lost wealth, health and reputation."
anti	It is more likely Scotland will leave the UK and thereby end the Great brittan union than the loss of the UK will lead to the end of EU
anti	It is not a nightmare to be in the EU. What planet are you on, brexiteers ?
anti	It is not something to celebrate
pro	It is not surprising that the unelected bureaucrats of the EU have not thought this through and what will happen when their fascist bullying leads to trade under WTO terms. Before our homegrown Remtards throw a track may I suggest they research what the tariffs are when goods are imported into the EU under WTO and where does the money go. Now apply those rules to EU27 goods imported to the UK and see where the money goes. KERCHING!!
anti	"It is not the EU that is destined to collapse, but the UK, as Ireland, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland secede from the UK to apply independently to the EU. No more UK. No more Great Britain. No more Britain, Just little England drifting away, free at last, just like some of the homeless zombies most of us have encountered in our downtowns who see themselves as so much freer than the rest of us, slaves to jobs, cars, families, bills and mortgages. Meanwhile, the EU goes from 28 to 27, then to 31. There were precedents for the whole affair. On page 74 of ""The Government and Politics of the European Union"", 7th Edition, 2010, a part of The European Union Series, discussing the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty of 2004, author Neill Nugent states that UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, ""anticipating the next general election, responded to a Conservative Party promise that it would call a referendum on the Constitutional Treaty by promising one himself."" Cameron was just a copy-cat. Who failed EU History 101. In the next paragraph, Nugent wrote, over six years ago: ""A referendum is, of course, much more difficult for a government to control than a parliamentary vote. Citizens can 'cause problems' in two ways: by taking a contrary view to the government on the issue at stake, or by expressing a view on an issue or issues other than the one that features in the referendum question.. Both of these 'problems' influenced voting when ratification referendums were held in France on 29 May 2005 and three days later in the Netherlands on 1 June.... The outcomes of the two referendums were clear rejections of the CT.... The question then became 'what now?'"" Doomed to repeat it! Cameron will have special prominence in the 8th Edition. And a few other places. The wave that ruled Britannia."
anti	It is obvious now that brexit will become a series of exceptions that only benefit the rich, or big industry and the banks. Travel will be compromised for 'normal' tourists, the pound has already collapsed, and the NHS cannot run without staff.
anti	It is only right, and the UK should not expect to get something for nothing. The UK played themselves, and I hope they get fucked.
pro	It is over for the EU.
anti	It is patently obvious that we were not informed enough to make a vote. They made a vote showing discontent and I understand this discontent. However I believe we are all more informed now to make a better call on this.
pro	It is pointless voting for pro EU freeloaders like most of our MPs are then whining when they try and sabotage Brexit.
pro	It is possible to have a trade deal done this year....I am totally convinced that the relations with the UK are stable, and after Brexit will be even better...and of course we have globally, common interests.
anti	It is probably the biggest fuckup to happen in Europe since WW2 and it would be ridiculous to not say so
pro	It is reasonable to believe that older voters voted to leave , I as one voted to leave the EEC in the 1975 referendum , older voters have experienced EU membership over a long period and a better placed to judge the merits of the EU . Britain wanted to join the EEC , I think John Major made a big mistake to sign the Maastricht Treaty without a referendum . I do not believe that young people are EU enthusiasts , it is EU officials politicians and business people who push the idea .
anti	It is sad. A German friend of mine went & posted some pics on facebook. She is a media professional and has lived in the UK for at least 25 years. She was very upset about brexit and considers Britain her home.
anti	It is seriously going to hurt UK and in the end EU will offer to help and let them back in but only if UK agrees to specific terms unconditionally.
pro	It is simple, the fact is that the leave campaign wins. What is the problem?
pro	It is stupid to sold out your country to a bunch of Un-Elected politician(EU).
anti	It is surprising how many of the Brexiteers have no clue which way up the union flag should be flown so I don't think they have much credibility in who ,why and how flags should be used.
pro	It is the Brexiters who were, and still are, fighting for independence and freedom. Thank goodness the Remainers and their intolerant hatred of democracy was defeated.
pro	It is the beginning of the end for the EU
pro	It is the first step to genuine sovereignty. This is bad? I think it's good for any country.
pro	It is the function of extremely complex and formal rules-based systems to crush the life and spirit out of the lay people under their jurisdiction. The EU are truly the Vogons of Europe and we will be far happier now we are almost free of them.
pro	It is the piecewise different sound bites on proBrexit Nigel, etc. they‚Äôve heard strung together into a train of incoherency. I did a better job in a complete presentation fail not having read the book for a class at 12 years of age cheating and using the abbreviated Cliff Notes
pro	It is the remain supporters who will find the future hardest to reconcile with. To have so little pride and faith in your country is a heavy cross to bear.
anti	It is the worst thing to happen to UK since WW2
anti	It is through the EU that you exchange criminal records and passenger records and work together on counter-terrorism...We need the collective weight of the EU when you are dealing with Russian aggression or terrorism.
pro	It is time to bomb the EU.
pro	It is true that some people catastrophize about it but why? Switzerland, USA, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand aren‚Äôt in the EU and they are all advanced, prosperous, democratic and civilised places.
pro	It is up to the people to decide what their leaders do, and for their leaders to give a reason why they make certain policies. It's not up to the EU, who for sure have their own Empire building agenda to why they do want they do. This is why the people want to leave, we want our leaders back, not puppets.
pro	It is up to the people to decide what their leaders do, and for their leaders to give a reason why they make certain policies. It's not up to the EU.
anti	It is very sad. We live in a troubled world. Many people seem to vote without engaging their brains. I just want peace, people to get along with one another, respect their differing opinions and engage in building communities with trust and kindness.
pro	It is well known that for democracy to work those that lose a vote have to accept the result...otherwise you have a Banana Republic. We voted leave. That is: leave the SM, leave the CU and leave the ECJ.
anti	It is wrecking lives; has led to a surfacing of racism, xenophobia and violence; and will cause misery.
pro	It isn't goodbye, it is hello from an independent UK.
pro	It isn't goodbye, it is hello, from an independent UK.
anti	It makes Britain poorer, weaker, less influential, less respected, bitterly divided.
anti	It makes me feel like the US and Britain are in some weird competition to out-moron each other
anti	It makes me so mad. We're being stripped of our E.U. citizenship against our wills.
anti	It makes me so sick, in fact I have just emailed genealogist this evening to check whether my grandmother was actually born in Ireland. I am that desperate to remain in the EU.
anti	It makes no different for Britain; the distance between Britain and the rest of Europe is actually the same as yesterday.
pro	It makes sense to get out. Why would the Britain want the rest of Europe telling them what to do? I cant stand when people try to tell me what to do.
pro	It may be geographically part of Europe but that‚Äôs where it ends I for one am English not European I would like to decide that for myself and not be told what I gave to be.. Thanks.
pro	It means it is the beginning of the ending of Globalism! It is the start of a glorious age! Next stop is TRUMP 2016.
anti	It means: 1. Recession 2. Loss of economic influence in a global economy 3. Loss of cultural influence 4. The break up of the U.K. Great job Dominic!
anti	It needs to be understood by everyone that large corporations such as Airbus are not making irrational threats when they talk about relocating operations after Brexit
anti	It never was. It was the will of Boris so he and his American friends could get richer. Only 40% of Brits, if that, voted for Brexit.
pro	It says a lot about the government and parliment.. When they keep remain on a table when all of them were Elected on a manifesto to leave...
pro	It says something about the dire moribund intellectual void that is pro Euro leftist dogma, that when a nation democratically leans toward cessation from a failing inept corrupt undemocratic illusion of prosperity, such as the EU.
anti	It seems an absolute shit show and I can't help but wonder if, after all this trouble and doubt, some people might like to vote again. That said, we've got enough of our own issues I'm not going to throw any stones in the foreign relations area unless someone asks.
pro	It seems clear to me that politicians and technocrats are moving towards bigger unity within the continent but the project is quite flawed for the very specific reason that we live in a continent with over 30 countries, each with their own culture, history and... economies.
anti	It seems like Brexit is a miserable failure of our time.
anti	It seems so irresponsible that the BREXITEERS went to the British public with all kinds of promises, but they didn't have a PLAN for how to exit the EU. It has turned out to be a nightmare. where is Farage now? Where is Boris?
anti	It seems that Brexiteers are living in their own, PARALLEL UNIVERSE! The EU is 12X BIGGER than the UK! Who do you THINK will dictate terms of TRADE??
anti	It seems that the patients have all broken out the asylum today.
anti	"It seems that they're having fine time in Parliament these days. Apparently they haven't fathomed the fact that they are down the drain if they don't remain a member of the most significant European organization in all of history. It seems they have never realized the importance of having a European Germany rather than a German Europe. Rescind the Brexit-nonsense, call off the ""divorce"". We all want you among us, the united peaceful European Nations. Why indeed antagonize yourselves from the obvious common good? In many ways you are special, but NOT that special! Greetings from Denmark."
anti	It seems to me that the UK is shooting itself in the foot.
anti	It seems to me that, since it is likely that Russia interfered with the referendum, a second vote is justified.
pro	It should be so simple to make the Irish Backstop Agreement time limited. This would pass through the commons. However, it was never the intention of the EU to let Britain leave. To make a success of Brexit would undermine the whole of the EU. Therefore we will have to leave with no deal. Brexit will benefit Britain in the long term. Remainers sadly can't see beyond tomorrow.
anti	It sounds like Brittain has the same problem the US has in this reguard: when a misinformed idiot's vote counts equally as much as a well-informed person's vote, stupid stuff happens. Sadly, the idiots vastly outnumber the intelligent, largely because politics is complicated and having a complete picture usually requires a lot of study (especially when certain media conglomerates make it their goal in life to misinform the populace). The UK gets to deal with Brexit, while the US has to sludge through the garbage dump that is Trump. Welcome to the crazy club...
anti	It still annoys me that Britain left on the basis of lies, ignorance and bigotry.
anti	"It stresses the uncertainty surrounding the forecasts, but concludes: ""The impact of Brexit on the UK energy system is very likely to be negative."""
anti	It struck me at the time, and still does, that the desire to leave the EU reached an almost cult-like obsession - Emotionally driven without any real regard for facts or expert opinion. It is such a shame because the EU is literally the least of our problems ‚Äì As you say, it has probably been supporting the poor more than our own government.
anti	It takes Homer Simpson to nail it: ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs the point of going out? We are going to wind up back here anyway‚Äô‚Ä¶
pro	It the same story throughout the negotiations - they‚Äôd love to punish us....but whenever they try they realise their actions and threats badly effect themselves too. Deep down they feel we must be punished. That is their mind set. It‚Äôs what they are constantly trying to find something to bash us with that doesn‚Äôt impact them negatively too.
pro	It took a man to liberate Britain from the EU tyranny.
anti	It turns out, we like EU regulations, but we just don't want em. We're idiots.
pro	It was a good idea, keep the UK strong! Youll see it is good for the long run
pro	It was a vote, done democratically, in which the minority vote is attempting to overthrow the will of the voters. They call that something, it rhymes with facism.
pro	It was absolutely about immigration and EU dictatorship.
pro	It was already voted for by the people, so why ask dumb questions like this?
pro	It was an honest vote, those claiming to have voted leave but now want to stay ARE LIARS FROM REMAIN CAMP.
anti	It was and still is a terrible idea poorly executed
anti	It was never a good idea at any point; since this is also a point, no.
pro	It was one of those historic days where you can honestly say that every true British person was proud to be British!
pro	It was refreshing to see Scotland, Wales and Ireland‚Äôs flags in Parliament square instead of that vile EU dictatorship flag...
anti	It was shit yesterday and the last time I looked it's still shit.
pro	It was the right thing to do to leave. The EU is becoming an authoritarian bureaucracy that cares little for anything except power. They already want every member to adopt their failed currency by the year 2020.
pro	It was the will of the people; it should be done.
pro	It was the will of the people; it should be done. And if she can't or won't do it properly, Theresa May has got to go.
anti	It wasn't a good idea at any point. It was the rabid wet dream of a small bunch of millionaires who saw an opportunity for profit, which was enabled by a disenfranchised and misinformed public.
anti	It wasn't a surprise after all, stupid people always outnumbered the clever ones, that is why politicians in every country are trying to convice them to become the herd they need.
anti	It wasn't just like shooting yourself in the foot, it was taking aim at it beforehand
anti	It wasn't just like shooting yourself in the foot, it was taking aim at it beforehand.
pro	It wasn't much of a party for me, I had a quiet and very enjoyable meal with friends, and broke my dry January with a decent single malt at the same time as raising a glass to Brexit. For me there's no triumph in it though, it's a sense of overwhelming relief that the right side won. It very nearly did not win. It almost lost to a crew of the ugliest characters in modern politics, thoroughly despicable people who had long ago effectively conspired to deliver the UK to the European Single Government trussed up like a Christmas turkey. They almost won, and they haven't given up yet.
pro	It will allow a change of economic model from the clapped-out neoliberalism, significant rollback from which is prohibited by the EU. Whether we seize that chance, and which model we choose, is up to us.
pro	It will be a different relationship, but I think it can have the same benefits in terms of that free access to trade
anti	It will be a nightmare
anti	It will be a unattractive and small island since there is a exodo of EU and foreigners companies that will not like to pay tariffs and the complete loss of EU subsidies to the UK universities that became less attractive for investigation and development .
anti	It will be interesting where the world will go in the coming years at this point we have two path fall in to the grip of hate or begin to fight for growing equality and start to create a better world or go back to a time where millions where killed for where they lived and what they looked like.
pro	It will be the end of GREAT Britain if we don't leave - wish all the British people could understand that it's the most important thing in our lives right now! Transport is crippled along with every other service - we can see everything cracking around us- we all need to wake up!!!! Otherwise it's too late and we are done!
pro	It will bounce back, this is typical market behaviour. Also no need to be so rude. Never blame those who voted, all ways those who did not!
anti	It will get a *lot* worse if we leave
anti	It will get even worse for those people. I did not and never would vote for a Tory government but blaming people in Brussels for decisions made in London was the height of stupidity.
anti	It will impact not only UK and existing members of the EU but also the rest of the countries.
anti	It will impact not only UK ¬†and existing members of the EU but also the rest of the countries.
anti	It will leave us poorer, due to loss of the extremely good trading terms with the EU that we have now
anti	It will mean new trade friction for agriculture and manufacturing; and significant new barriers for service exports
anti	It will only be a matter of time until at least half of the factories we see here are closed , relocated or downsized.
pro	It will potentially give us more control on immigration, laws etc
anti	It will reduce the power of the UK, It will not ‚Äòteach those politicians/bureaucrats/elitists/whoever a lesson‚Äô.
anti	It will take a number of generations to get over this mistake, for every country in the EU and the UK. I still can‚Äôt understand how the Brits ever got convinced how Brexit was a good idea...
anti	It will take a number of generations to get over this mistake, for every country in the EU and the UK. I still can‚Äôt understand how the Brits ever got convinced how Brexit was a good idea‚Ä¶
pro	It will take remainers years, if ever, to accept Brexit. They are glass half empty people. They will be scavenging for anything negative coming out of our media over the next year or two, ( and there will be plenty from our left wing remainer media), to pounce on, and crow over. They want Brexit to be a complete utter and dismal failure out of spite. Comments from them on here over the last couple of days alone, will bear this out.
anti	It would awful for EU and quite bad for UK. It gives biz-friendly examples being sometimes the only reasonable voice around. All the I numerous exports UK to EU need red-tapes as much as you need Sand in your flour. I‚Äôm against!
pro	It would be Good if people would just give Boris a chance, time for whinging is over put your EU flags away and get behind the majority of the country
anti	It would be a bloody stupid thing to do. I sincerely hope the British people have enough sense to kill off the idea.
pro	It would be a great success if we get our boards back and we actually leave the EU
anti	It would be a spectacularly self-defeating move. And nobody has the time to go through the whole process of having them come crawling back yet again just because their domestic politics is basically a kindergarden.
anti	It would be an unmitigated disaster to leave.
anti	It would be the saddest thing! Do not leave the EU, we all need to reform it so it works for all of us. Leaving is just a failure for nations of Europe, and giving up a great project, just because some of the politicians manage it badly.
pro	It would be worth every penny to be free of the EU
pro	It'll be a pleasure to take our custom elsewhere. UK imports from the EU were ¬£357 billion (53% of all UK imports). Ouch!
anti	It'll directly affect my life so I've been watching along closely. I'm an American living in the UK and I'm married to an EU citizen. So depending on what type of deal there is (which is seeming much more likely than a no-deal at this point), it'll determine whether we stay in the country or not.
anti	It'll harm brexiters more too, given that on average the less educated you were, the more likely you were to support brexit. The knowledge economy will absolutely leave them behind.
anti	It'll make the UK weaker, poorer, lower their standard of living and their quality of life, limit the options avalable to UK citizens, and make the UK less influential in the world
anti	It'll take us years to agree terms with anyone. Because if we leave other countries have the upper hand. We'll have to take whatever is being offered they know we'll be desperate. It''l take about 10 years to agree exit terms with the EU.
pro	It's #BrexitDay - the day our great nation finally breaks free, leaves the EU and becomes a sovereign, independent, global Britain once again.
anti	It's 2019. Shouldn't the world be pulling together instead of splintering apart? I really do despair. #fuckbrexit
pro	It's Anglo-Saxon free thinking, common law, a free market economy and a positive outlook for me. EU statism is so miserable, demoralising and inflexible.
pro	It's BS like this that show just how right we are to be getting out of the EU. Any club that treats members that wish to leave like this is no club that I want to be a part of.
anti	It's OK for you, my last project was cancelled due to Brexit.
anti	It's a bad idea to leave. The economy will collapse if we do and Britain will fall.
pro	It's a beautiful thing.
anti	It's a classic case of a poorly educated electorate and a self-regarding society turning in on itself and navel gazing
anti	It's a clusterfuck that just won't end, but no matter how they solve it, it's going to be jumping from a frying pan into the fire.
anti	It's a complete joke and a mess. We get the worst of both sides.
pro	It's a conspiracy!! The liberal, Hollywood media wanting to control the out come. We've not left. Yet!?
anti	It's a dark few years ahead
pro	It's a different language than what you here from remoaners. Crystal clear sense.
anti	It's a economic bad decision
pro	It's a economic good decision
anti	It's a fucking travesty
pro	It's a glorious new Britain
pro	It's a good thing. The EU is heading in a direction that isn't good.
pro	It's a great day for Remoaners too. They're now all free to leave the UK, the country they hate so much !! Enjoy, won't you all. I'd like to say we'll miss your mewling, but the fact is, we won't. Bye.
anti	It's a pity, but hey, f*ck off Britain, you deserve a Brexit without benefits - no solidarity goes both ways. You have been arrogant enough within the EU, time to STAY ON YOUR ISLAND, and sort it out yourself!
anti	It's a prime example of how not to do referendums
anti	It's a sad day. Those who voted for it will either be rich enough to survive OK .. or .. they'll be too poor to cope with the increased prices etc. Those who voted to remain as Europeans are scrabbling to find solutions; the rich will be fine of course but once again the poor will be right up against it.
anti	It's a sad result of the bass ackwards right-shifted stab at a new era of Mercantilism. It should be put to a final public vote, and there should be a stipulation added to article 50 that countries must hold a vote to start article 50, enter a period of structuring where the country in question plans their exit strategy, without allowing any funds to be used for advertising a particular exit strategy. Following the period of deciding the strategy, it should be put under a second public vote to decide whether article 50 will continues or not. Leaving the EU isn't good for anyone, the best way to increase the standards of living is to unify intent and ideals, not unnecessarily create new divisions that weren't there before.
pro	It's a scary thing to imagine my bloodline mixing with cenks.
anti	It's a shambles.
anti	It's a shame for the 48%, but it's the leadership of their country and their thick bigoted compatriots who are to blame.
anti	It's a shame that I wasn't able to vote, if I was able to I would have voted to remain. As a teenager it is annoying that I cannot decide on my future. I don't think it is right that we have to rely on older people to 'decide for us'. Bizarre.
anti	It's a shitshow in the same vein as our President, and a lot of people didn't know what they were voting for.
anti	It's a terrible idea. Not because the EU is a good thing, because the EU is also quite bad. But because Britain is so terrible and incompetent it should never be trusted to command its own destiny as a country.
anti	It's a total kamikaze move.
anti	It's a typical case of not knowing what they had until it's gone :( sad situation and sad future to look forward to. It will take so much time to recover from this.....
anti	It's a very clever idea, because that means you always have an excuse for the disastrous effects. They've moved their claims to be completely outside of scrutiny. I actually do feel sorry for this guy, as stupid as he was for supporting Brexit. He's had his mind poisoned by the most filthy, opportunistic liars and ended up losing everything.
anti	It's a very very very bad idea to leave the EU. You don't think about the Britain's futur. If Britain leaves the EU the country will be lost and very little in front of the United States of America and the oders emergents countries
pro	It's about Damn time! Jolly good! Hip hip hurray!
pro	It's about time the power's that be !! Should realise OUT means OUT and for goodness sake just get On with it and tell junker to sling his hook !!!!!?
anti	It's abundantly clear that the UK government is neither competent nor prepared enough to make anything other than a mess out of this given the tight deadline.
anti	It's actually sad to see how the country is so poorly informed.
anti	It's all downhill from here isn't it? I hope Johnson and his cabinet crash and burn along the way.
anti	It's all just a big con job on the people, wait till we see what happens by the end of the year.
anti	It's all ok guys, it won't cost us ¬£7 to go to Europe. You'll just pay 10-20% more for your holiday there (on top of the 15% increase already) as the pound devalues üëå
anti	It's all on Brexiters, now. The people who lied and propagandised for Brexit, and the people who voted for it. Still no coherent plan. I bet you wished you'd lost.
anti	It's all smoke and mirrors BJ is a conman.
anti	It's almost like the market wants to remain. Corbyn is totally right when he says that May has ignored what the economy wants.
anti	It's almost like this whole thing was a really bad idea that no one thought through.
pro	It's also worth pointing out that if the UK joins TPP than it will be roughly the same size as the remaining EU bloc and larger in population terms. If the US could be convinced to rejoin then it would be almost twice the size as an economic area.
pro	It's always about the economy with the anti UK side which is obviously important but it can't be the only reason for staying it.
pro	It's an absolute embarrassing thing when the EU court think they can over rule the British people. We voted out and that means out
anti	It's an embarrassing time to be English. Fear and loathing overwhelms the poorest and least educated. The people that voted to leave were sold a lie. Dear world: don't make the same mistake we did.
pro	It's an exciting day for the country! Now we can all come together as a nation
anti	It's as if Brexit is a terrible idea or something.
anti	It's bad enough I have to live with a Tory Government. I don't fancy living with an unregulated Tory Government. I value my human rights too much for that.
anti	It's been two years, people have changed their minds. And if they haven't what would the harm be in another vote? Unless you're afraid remain will win this time.
pro	It's been under pressure for the last 15 years under both Tory and Labour governments. The only way to regain control of our borders and enforce deportations is to leave. Britain for the British.
pro	"It's better to die free, than live as a slave."""
pro	It's coming home, it's coming home Britain's Coming Home ‚ú®üá¨üáßüéâ
anti	It's crap. Everyone in the UK loses.
anti	It's dangerous if Brexit happens. UK is finished.
anti	It's deeply ironic that the areas of high manufacturing in the Midlands/North that enabled Brexit to happen are the ones that will be thrown under the bus in the pursuit of Trade Deals that favour our services focussed economy.
anti	It's disgusting to see that I am from a country that are filled with lunatics. It's a headache
anti	It's disturbingly Trump-like in style and I consider it a pretty major red flag in terms of global politics
anti	It's dumb and it doesn't feel thought through.
anti	"It's entirely May's (and Cameron's) fault that this decision has to be made now, just four months before the cliff, no options left. The UK has been in the EU for fourty years and helped shape the single market, there is no excuse for them not to know how the EU works at its core. All this time they have wasted trying to negotiate with a rulebook set in stone. They should have decided what exactly they wanted (without contradictory red lines) before triggering article 50. This crisis is completely self inflicted. May is also to blame for not preparing the country for any kind of Brexit, leaving businesses and government completely in the dark on what's going to happen, four months from the date. When one of the options includes things like food shortages and indefinitely grounded airplanes. Of course more of the blame is on Cameron who should not have made the referendum question so deceptively simple. Lots of wildly different possibilities are all grouped under ""leave"", it was always a given that whatever form it would eventually take would only be liked by a minority. The blame is on all of UK politics for still considering a 52-48 result valid when the Leave side was guilty of illegal campaign funding, huge lies, ties with Russia, and so on. The referendum result should have been declared invalid by Parliament. Nobody in UK politics has tried to find a compromise between the sides even though an extremely close result calls for that. But the worst are Boris Johnson, Gove, Rees-Mogg and others whose fighting for disaster Brexit for years within the Tory Party made Cameron feel there had to be a referendum in the first place. They are there for their own ego and financial gain, don't care about good government or the people and shouldn't be close to power. If no-deal Brexit happens and people die as a result, its blood on their hands."
anti	It's far, far worse than that. Voters are refusing to acknowledge facts, facts that are very easy to verify. This isn't restricted to the Brexit debate either. It shows up with anti-vaxxers, flat-earthers, climate change, Trump supporters. It's a very dangerous trend.
pro	It's funny how the EU is actually run and basically owned by the Germans. They want to keep all in to keep them owned so to say. Koodos to the UK for breaking free from an oppressed cash and unable to sell at the price they want for what they sell to other countries. No more German rule
anti	It's funny how the same people who want the UK to be independent from the EU, don't want Scotland to be independent from the UK.
anti	It's funny, these idiots that voted leave didn't do much research on how hard they will fall in economy it will take them years to recover.
anti	"It's going to be devastating"" ‚Äì here's how Brexit will screw over British touring artists"
anti	It's gonna be a close one! Company I work in has its European headquarters in London because of UK membership in EU and if BrExit really happens they already have move to Munich ready.
anti	It's gonna be funny to watch the pound plummet, no trade deals, paperwork on imports and price rises,the u.k literally just screwed itself, who will you trade with? the e.u don't need your services
pro	It's good we've gone, but we'll never know the good deal we could already have concluded if it hadn't been for all the remainiac traitors working on behalf of the EU al this time - [and I am including Theresa May in that] - one of the might have beens of history.
pro	It's good we've gone, but we'll never know the good deal we could already have concluded if it hadn't been for all the remainiac traitors working on behalf of the EU al this time - [and I am including Theresa May in that]¬† - one of the might have beens of history.
pro	It's good,because England has saved 2nd world war 2 the European countries.The kingdom must act her ownself her political kingdom identity except economy cooperation with Europeans.
pro	It's got to be the worst government, in the history of our country, absolutely Useless, it will be goodbye to most of them at the next. general Election , Plus the fact , thousands will not even bother to vote . because the referendum result to leave , they chose to ignore , ignoring the people's wishes,
pro	It's great that they have no more globalist agenda forced down their throats!
pro	It's great to hear that positive view of the UK. We can do it and that's why we don't need the EU. We don't need to lose any of the good laws the EU has instituted, just the bad ones and we should be able to decide for ourselves. We are a democracy and if we leave the EU what happens afterwards is down to the UK people, it's up to us to vote wisely. Better to have the power in the hands of people who understand the UK and have to live with it's policies than a group of unelected officials far removed from UK life. I'm in a similar demographic to you and it's us that really need to reach out to similar people and urge them to vote leave. We've still got time and we need everyone we can get. We haven't won until we've won.
pro	It's heart warming to see you guys celebrating and showing pride in your country again.
anti	It's hilarious and sad at the same time watching these people cheering about leaving EU like watching a friend who is quickly eating hamburger with super hot sauce without thinking what's gonna happen next
anti	It's hilarious that the colored folks in UK voted for Brexit. Those idiots didn't realize brexit is all about pro-white movement.
pro	It's just scaremongering. We'll be ok, we're British! Rule Britannia!
anti	It's like chopping off your arm after googling symptoms for the rash on it
pro	It's like leaving a bad marriage you happy it's all over!
anti	It's like someone wanted to simulate the confusion and [shortages](https://apnews.com/3a9d922f6fb14049af6c0abe042f316f) of war without the shooting. It's like an inverse Dunkirk evacuation.
anti	It's like the people who voted for brexit didn't think it through.
anti	It's literally like shooting one's self in the foot. Dumb AF
anti	It's long-term pain for no gain, only more pain.
pro	It's not EU that has kept the peace in Europe, it is NATO: @LouiseBoursUKIP. @bbcquestiontime Well said.
pro	It's not about immigration etc, at the end of the day its about SOVEREIGNTY
pro	It's not about money, it's about freedom.
anti	It's not bad news, it's the best chance of stopping Brexit.
pro	It's not going to be that bad lol the government wouldn't allow it otherwise so just sit back and chill :)
anti	It's not going to happen, simply because it can't. There's no structures in place to handle such a thing. Just look at this fact: the UK imports 70% of its food. Now tell me, how would you expect to sit at a negotiating table after brexit and have a fair negotiation with any powerful country knowing this fact? You need them to feed yourself! Its like arguing with your parents while living at their expense, you can say what you want but in the end we know who gets to decide.
pro	It's not so much that Brexit or Trump are good for working people, it's that the EU and the globalist neoliberal project in general is spectacularly bad for workers.
pro	It's not so much we don't want to integrate or work with Europe, we just don't want to be in the European Union and they're not the same thing. The EU is an ugly Neo-con, anti-democratic, chronically corrupt institution with a long term gain of a federal Europe, at the mercy of big corporates and private interest groups. In the UK people think that they'll look after our interests above our own government. But a quick look at Greece and Spain shows that they'll asset strip and privatize as their banking masters want. There is no European public. There are still separate national publics, and there surely will be for as far ahead as we can see. This creates a paradise for lobbyists, who can (and do) act unhindered by media or public scrutiny to influence the places where real power lies in Brussels, that is with the commission and within the even-more-secretive council. The logic of the EU, if it is ever to be democratised, is to become a United States of Europe. The euro is a Trojan horse to achieve this goal of fiscal and political union. Either one needs to be a federalist, or one needs to ditch the EU. Cameron, Jeremy Corbyn and the rest are trying to have it both ways. It‚Äôs an unstable halfway house, and will fail, as in effect the euro has already failed. The EU will fail within 10-15 years, we need to get out now!
anti	It's not the 'UK' it's our voting system that's retarded.. once all these bitter old fuckers who think they're ode something die we'll come back.. Just probably with a worse off deal
pro	It's not the polls that count, it's where you put your X on Thursday. Save our Country from the Dictatorship of the EU. For DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM, and INDEPENDENCE Vote LEAVE.
pro	It's not what big business want, it's what the British people voted for and that was to leave the EU!
pro	It's not working due to none of the elites wanting it to work.
pro	It's official! BREXIT Jan 30, 2020!!! A historical day
anti	It's official: Brexit Britain is a laughing stock.
anti	It's ok that we voted Brexit, because now we've exposed the 52% of Britain that have single digit IQ's
pro	It's ok to be a brexiteer.
pro	It's only as people are non believers.what will they say when Britain gets better
pro	It's only the idiots that are holding up our leaving that are making it a farce, leaving the EU is the best thing to happen to Britain since we joined it.
anti	It's only the start and the possibility of a happy outcome is very unlikely.
pro	It's over. The film has finished, the audience is filing out, but still the Remain trolls refuse to leave their seats.
pro	It's painful to watch .. No one voted for a REMAIN deal..
anti	It's painful to watch. The UK government has completely failed to do their jobs on th emost basic level
anti	It's painfully ironic that a country that never cared for the borders of other countries during it's imperialistic era and specialized in murdering, pillaging, abusing and stealing resources of other countries now has a primary concern about it's BORDERS loooool.
anti	It's pointless trying to twist Brexit to make it fit, it ain't going to work.
anti	It's pretty simple what we voted for. We want to live in the EU. We don't understand how can anyone not want to live in the EU?! And now we lost, we are both angry at being dragged out of the EU against our will and even more at the prospect of the country we love being shattered into many pieces over this issue.
anti	It's probably the worst thing that has happened in Europe so far this century
anti	It's probably the worst thing that has happened in Europe so far this century. History will judge it harshly.
anti	It's provable reality that Brexit is a huge mistake
pro	It's really easy for champagne socialists in the South, in places like Bath and Bristol, to label Northerners as racist. Being at uni taught me that some Southerners are all for multiculturalism and more immigration, mainly because it doesn't affect them. Coming from such a white, middle class background means that they are so privileged and are so pretentious because non of the down-sides of EU membership affect them. Of course they want to remain it means that Daddy's company will do better and be able to hire cheap immigrant labour without filling out much paperwork.
anti	It's shit show, but it's their shit show....it's not like we don't have one of our own.
pro	It's simple the UK needs to leave the EU and take care of the British people first.
anti	It's simple, brexit will effect the EU negatively but the UK will be worse off.
anti	It's so funny that many of the Brexit voters were running to get residency in the EU before Brexit. It's like they don't understand laws can be changed to send them back to the island
pro	It's so simple. We leave with no deal on article 24 on WTO terms with no tariffs until a deal is sorted.
anti	It's the first day of your nightmare british people.
anti	It's the single most dumb thing you could do
pro	"It's the start of a brave new ""Brexit"" world. Looking forward not back."
anti	It's the year 2819. Today we celebrate the annual 'Brexit extension'. Noone really knows where this tradition comes from, nor what the term 'brexit' means, but as part of the festivities the dumbest man that can be found is given all the power and a blonde wig. Later when the celebrations are over the youths have to clean up the utter mess left behind.
pro	It's time for everyone to be independent. This was supposed to happen last year. Get ready fot the market to crash. The world is going to make a major change in a few years.
anti	It's time to #Brejoin!
pro	It's time to restore true democracy & that is why I am voting to leave the EU on June 23rd.
anti	It's time to stop brexit
anti	It's too bad you can't force the architects of this disaster to see things through to the end and not be able to just resign.
pro	It's true, it can be the small things in life that can bring you joy, I voted Leave, and seeing Remaoners trying to overturn a democratic vote does bring a smile on a daily basis...
anti	It's unbelievable this Friday the UK will leave the EU because of 1,269,501 votes. What's even more disturbing is the less than 70% voter turnout in the remain areas of England vs the 70% and over turnout in areas that voted leave. Most remain areas like Liverpool, Manchester, and London with massive populations had only¬†65% - 68% turnout. How different things would be with an extra 5% - 10% remain voter support. All the EPL clubs voted remain¬†along with¬†the financial center of the entire island yet no intelligent concession was made for these sectors that provide 80% of the UK GDP. Something is seriously wrong with Westminster and I completely understand Scotland's necessity to look out for its own future.
pro	"It's undemocratic. None of the peoples of Europe have voted in a party that had as its manifesto ""we will dissolve our nation into a superstate"". Certainly not the UK, anyway."
anti	"It's unfair to say ""we"", a great number of people are against crashing out."
pro	"It's very simple for me, at this point I pretty much tune out the arguments put forth on the economy and immigration, it's more about the ceding of powers do a foreign controller. You can say what you will about the extent to which it does control our laws but the issue is that it does at all. We joined for an economic union, then the referendum happened and we were promised no political union, then in the 90's they said fuck that and went head long into the creation of the European superstate. What irritates me more is when I see people arguing something a long the lines of ""The European Union does awesome stuff too and this and that."", I do not care. I'm English and more than that British, not European, there may be lessons to be learned sure but I am not a European citizen, I am a British Citizen, I don't care how big your pot of gold I'm not shitting on the Magna Carta a year after it's eight hundredth anniversary. I also hear people blathering on about how the EU has maintained peace in Europe; absolute bollocks - Nato has maintained peace in Europe, the EU nowadays seems to be desperate to taunt Russia and prove that it's a ""big boy"" now. I see an underhanded and unbelievably incremental and slow but very evidently there, degradation of the powers of the UK. Also the lies at every turn, Nigel Farage (the crazy horrible badman that is a fearmongerererer and a nasty xenophobe) pointed out a few years ago about the future creation of a European Army that had been discussed and just how terrible an idea it was. No, absolutely not, we would NEVER build a European army. Fast forward a few years and now there is one being openly discussed like it's the best idea since sliced bread. Oh no! Tis but the border force! Equipped with all the latest tanks and fighter aircraft and naval fleets to deal with those pesky... Erm... Border jumpers? There is also the rumour of the removal of Article 50 so there would never be another chance to peacefully leave and this worried me greatly. The way I see it is this, Voting to Remain has appealed to people I think in part because of an attitude of ""I'm not going to be scared into leaving!"" which is funny because it's pretty much the same mentality on the other side for, all of big business and the media coming out to say we should remain makes you feel a little like you're being fear mongered to. It seems that to vote to remain is the future (next 40 years) dissolution of the UK as a sovereign nation, and the vote to leave (harrowing a journey it may be) will lead to us at the very least being able to fuck up on our own or prosper on our own. As we should do. Just a quick note for the word twister's out there, I'm not meaning some pseudo-hermit kingdom. Normal trade with the world like the world does anyway, without an (increasingly infectious) political union."
pro	It's what people voted for. This is democracy in action.
pro	Italian MEP has hit the nail squarely on the head. The EU us a mafia style racket and is the modern face of European Fascism. The conduct of the EU over Brexit has revealed the true nature of the German dominated EU Empire
pro	Italians supporting Brexit ! god bless UK ! keep being master of your fate
pro	Italy and france will likely to follow england soon..
pro	Italy going into recession soon they can't pay off the interest of it's debt because it's economy as stopped growing and a few other EU countries are heading the same way it's time to leave now
pro	Its a very very easy decision, and we are finally being allowed it! OUT OUT OUT!
anti	Its actually sick, I see the poorest and most destitute people in the UK gloating on facebook about the tory victory while their public services crumble around them. Complete insanity.
pro	"Its actually the EU who have created the so-called ""crisis"" because they don't want the UK to leave. If the EU would allow trade talks, a trade deal could remove the need for customs entirely"
pro	Its all about Politics versus common sense. If the EU want to cut their nose off to spite their face its up to them.
pro	Its all good - we're leaving No Deal bye bye EU dictators !
pro	Its all mental - Leaving the EU will create the opportunity for a MASSIVE economic boom in the UK. I think most people have stopped buying into all the 'fear' .....its going to be amazing.
anti	Its always the EUs fault, If we crash out on WTO rules it will be the EUs fault. The incompetence of brexiteers never gets touched on.
anti	Its amazing that one of the pillar members of the EU has convinced a plurality of its population that the EU is the reason for it's problems and has now left it in such a way. My admiration of the British people and their government has been greatly diminished by these actions from the last 4 years
anti	Its amazing to see that there is so huge class difference in the UK. People left on their own... Fighting to survive day after day. Its like in US. This is not European spirit. This is predatory capitalism. Few have more than they will ever need while the rest is living of the scraps. Leaving EU is just going to make things worse, but it's obvious that no-one cares about the future of UK.
pro	Its astonishing that some people still having allegiance with EU. For God sake stand up for your own nation once.
pro	Its because europe banned memes So.... Im happy i guess
pro	Its best for Britain to be in control of Britain just like its best for the US to be in control of the US. Death to globalism.
pro	Its better than Papa EU
anti	Its crazy how stupid people are. These brexiters are like the maga turds here in the states.
anti	Its depressing especially for northerners. Liverpool as a city was given so much for capital of culture, the entire of Merseyside benefits so much yet you get ignorant racists wanting to leave just cos immigrants stealing muh jobs
pro	Its going to be fantastic after 47 years in prison!
anti	Its going to be like a Divorced couple living in the same house.
anti	"Its good thing, ENGLAND leaves the EU. See what i did their? ENGLAND. Cause Scotland and Northern-Ireland will join the EU in the future. So ""great britain"" will be no more. I lolled so hard. Ukip leaders leaves, Boris leaves, Labour in shambles, ... It will be good for european to shop in webshops in the UK, now the pounds sacks. And lets not forget: if ENGLAND wants to have some foothold onto EU market, they have to pay MILLIONS of POUNDS to the EU to get acces to it. if not: good luck finding another 500 000 000 costumers market."
pro	Its just pure basic common sense to be able to control who is allowed to live in your country. It doesnt matter what race they are or where they come from, the problem is the number and the quality.
pro	Its not Brexit that we should be celebrating. Far more important is returning democracy to the people.
anti	Its not too late to reverse Brexit.
pro	Its only one vote for me and that is for UK to leave the European Circus.
pro	Its our traitors that need to be eliminated first.Them the EU and then Islam .Busy times ahead folks..
pro	Its sad and a little scary that the British people, who democratically voted to leave the EU, are being held hostage by an incompetent/corrupt Parliament and EU.
anti	Its sad that the majority was deluded enough to think brexit was a good thing.
pro	Its simple what we want. To LEAVE!
pro	Its simple, we dont like being controlled by a bunch of foreign bureaucrats.
anti	Its the UK who are the bullies. The EU have not changed their position in over 2 years - its our government who changes its mind.
pro	Its the other unmentionable that needs keeping out.
anti	"Its time to say "" STOP BREXIT"
anti	It‚Äôs #BrexitEve today, so remember to put your clocks back to 1973 before you go to bed.
anti	It‚Äôs a complete shit show ...but we know May is very sinister
anti	It‚Äôs a disaster. Please do something Hillary, we can‚Äôt allow Brexit to happen #StopBrexit.
anti	It‚Äôs a fucking stupid thing thing the U.K. did, a shit deal and they‚Äôd have been better off voting Remain. Absolutely no positives to it. None.
pro	It‚Äôs a momentous day. One in which Britain finally brings to an end a ghastly experiment that‚Äôs brought us nothing but suffering. At midnight, I urge us all to celebrate our freedom with riotous jubilation. Finally, the hell is over.
anti	It‚Äôs a ploy, a very stupid ploy, but what can you expect from a government of lazy know nothing incompetents.
pro	It‚Äôs a sham! Pushed up prices everywhere bad for lazy tourism and especially puts up food prices‚Ä¶.has huge waste and very inefficient a laugh considering it‚Äôs German run‚Ä¶owned‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs a dictatorship hub
pro	It‚Äôs a straightforward question about whether we want to be in the EU or not and the answer‚Äôs no.
anti	It‚Äôs a tragedy.
anti	It‚Äôs about Europe‚Äôs balance UK not to leave eu‚Ä¶ Eu was made to avoid wars by creating a balance of France,Germany and England!!! Brexit will be dangerous!!!
anti	It‚Äôs about people angry at the world changing around them when they have no interest in keeping up with the change. Globalisation is out of the hat. It‚Äôs not going back in no matter how hard they try. They might succeed for 2-3-5 years but the works will inevitably carry on evolving into the global village
pro	It‚Äôs about time some reality was put into our dealings with the EU. Their untenable belief that we desperately need to cling on to their coat tails is based on remoaner angst and encouragement. They need to understand that a trade deal is neither essential or desperately required. I do hope they are listening.
anti	It‚Äôs all madness! Whatever we agree to, whatever we negotiate - customs union, single market, whatever - we will never be better off out than in. Most of our politicians have totally lost sight of reality.
anti	It‚Äôs all making me 80s nostalgic. Just need the forthcoming mass unemployment and we will be back where we started!
pro	It‚Äôs all very well and good, but would you trust anything that comes from the EU ?
pro	It‚Äôs already difficult to get things done with the normal levels of government without another one governed by 27 other nations and their levels of government.
pro	It‚Äôs because we know in our bones that it is a daft way to run a whole continent
anti	It‚Äôs been Putin‚Äôs plan all along, to undermine democracies, the EU and NATO ... and it‚Äôs been working fab here in the US and over there now. Yet he couldn‚Äôt have done it without solid participation from so many of us ... let‚Äôs hope this darkness lifts soon.
pro	It‚Äôs beyond my comprehension why nation or citizen of any nation would want someone other then their elected officials to make laws and dictate how a country is run..
pro	It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúSelf Determination‚Äù ‚ÄúIndependence‚Äù ‚ÄúFreedom‚Äù. Great Britain was very successful and wealthy as their own Country ... before the EU.
anti	It‚Äôs funny when people say just leave already as there was no EU and people were just fine.
anti	It‚Äôs funny when people say just leave already as there was no EU and people were just fine. Yeah, but there were no computers and smartphones, we were just fine as well. Imagine if all computers broke today, I‚Äôm sure it will cause panic. But are human beings going to extinct because of this? No, but is it going to cause chaos? Definitely. If we want to lower the bar for living as to survive, I‚Äôm sure British people would do just fine.
pro	It‚Äôs great that Brits are getting their country back!
anti	It‚Äôs have to be considering we‚Äôre two months away from seeing an entire country get fucked
anti	It‚Äôs horrifying to see everything we knew Brexit would cause happening in front of our eyes - thousands of jobs going abroad, failure of investment, total absence of trade framework.Brexit reality #LetsJustStopIt
pro	It‚Äôs insulting to hear this news presenter say it‚Äôs not likely Britain will become America‚Äôs 51st state. Its ignorant insults like that which will make Britain a success. You really underestimate my country.
anti	"It‚Äôs interesting to hear Leavers proclaiming that we are now ""freed from the EU shackles"" yet fail to understand that the UK is now in ""vassalage"" to the EU for the rest of the year and possibly longer!"
anti	It‚Äôs just delayed- we‚Äôll be back in the EU within ten years, so what‚Äôs your point? Brexit will fail, and this experiment will prove once and for all that we are better off inside the EU- albeit next time on worse conditions, with the Euro, no rebate, no Scottish oil and gas to siphon off etc.
anti	It‚Äôs mad that 17 odd million can decide the fate for the rest of the 50 odd million who either were too young to vote, didn‚Äôt vote or voted no‚Ä¶
anti	It‚Äôs no wonder Downing Street has told some of these clowns to do one
anti	It‚Äôs not arrogance to suggest that only Remainers can think straight. Evidence-based research, backed up with independent verifiable rock solid data shows that our Remoaner thought processes did not lead to the ongoing, ahem, very damaging and expensive shambles!
pro	It‚Äôs not difficult, we voted to leave, so let‚Äôs leave and then we will know how it goes, neither the EU or the UK favour no deal, so let‚Äôs have a deal or we go
pro	It‚Äôs not the people of Europe we dislike it‚Äôs the corrupt EU commission and the EU superstate project.
anti	It‚Äôs official, I now officially hate the way this country is. Activism Time.
anti	It‚Äôs ok. Britain just don‚Äôt ask for German tax payers money when you have problems. Thanks
anti	It‚Äôs probably only ironic to anybody who thought Brexit would be good for the U.K. Everybody else knew this would happen.
anti	It‚Äôs quite funny how the Brexiters are STILL , trying to CONVINCE THEMSELVES - they did the - ‚Äòright thing ‚Äò !
anti	It‚Äôs quite simple really, if you have a young family and care about the future economic worth of the country vote to stay in the EU. If you don‚Äôt care about the future and just want go make sure you have money in your own pocket and say fcuk future generations than vote to get out.
anti	It‚Äôs remarkable that so many people genuinely believe Brexit is done and dusted. To those people I say show me what has changed when I wake up tomorrow morning. Everyone else can look forward to at least 12 more months (more like a few years) of wrangling about a trade deal in which we will come out losers, either because we couldn‚Äôt agree a deal or because we make stupid decisions on things like fishing.
anti	It‚Äôs ridiculous. It will completely destroy the country. No deal is worse tbf.
anti	It‚Äôs so sad watching conned gullibles waving their little flags in the misguided belief they‚Äôve ‚Äòwon‚Äô something.
anti	It‚Äôs so silly because I‚Äôm going to be affected from this deal the most as of my age and I couldn‚Äôt even vote. If all my age group got to vote their would be no brexit without a doubt.
anti	It‚Äôs so weird to see that people are celebrating their mistake.
anti	It‚Äôs striking how many lies the Brexiters are still telling. Lying about a trade deal, the trade-offs involved, the EU‚Äôs position, the transition. Even with an 80 seat majority and having achieved their Brexit. What does that say about their confidence in their own project?
anti	It‚Äôs the 1st of February and day one in the countdown towards the collapse of Brexit
pro	It‚Äôs the EU that will implode when we leave without a deal and they go bust.
anti	It‚Äôs the UK government that is threatening to ‚Äôcrucify‚Äô Ireland and the EU that is trying to protect our peace agreement.
anti	It‚Äôs time to turn up the heat on the EU by accelerating our post Brexit trade talks. The penny has finally dropped
pro	It‚Äôs time we were finally liberated.
pro	It‚Äôs time.
anti	It‚Äôs utterly idiotic. I‚Äôm astonished how many people just don‚Äôt get why it‚Äôs a terrible idea.
pro	"I¬†think even the shrillest, most unreconciled ""Remoaner"" would concede that this assertion is factually false."
anti	I¬†would have voted to stay - purely for selfish reasons (stability keeping ¬£ stronger and I like the option to live and work in Europe without visa).
pro	I¬¥m brazilian and I live in Brasil. I support brexit.
anti	I‚Äôd argue leaving has always been primarily emotionally driven, hence it‚Äôs very subjective, it means lots of different things to different people and so it‚Äôs hard to come to a consensus.
anti	I‚Äôd argue leaving has always been primarily emotionally driven, hence it‚Äôs very subjective, it means lots of different things to different people and so it‚Äôs hard to come to a consensus. Plans come together based on objective positions based on data to gain agreement, there isn‚Äôt a strong data driven argument for leaving hence Brexit supporters can‚Äôt form a plan, it‚Äôs all emotional IMO.
anti	I‚Äôd just like to point out that within the next couple of months the EU is bringing in a law that makes it illegal for big companies to avoid paying their taxes.
anti	I‚Äôm 17 but turn 18 in four days. This morning I‚Äôve woken up to feel completely betrayed by my own country. One thing that upsets me most is that this decision has been made by people who will not have to live with the consequences for as long as us. Young people voted to remain and older people voted to leave. I feel that I have been let down by an older generation who won‚Äôt be affected by the volatility of this decisions.
anti	I‚Äôm British and I struggle with Brexit!
anti	I‚Äôm British and now depressed
anti	I‚Äôm a Remainer. But even I accept the result . But I will say may your god help us
pro	I‚Äôm a brexit supporter (don‚Äôt kill me) and I still found this hilarious.
anti	I‚Äôm anti-Brexit but I can see no Brexit link here. If you simply blame Brexit on everything bad, you‚Äôll dilute and mask the real effects of Brexit.
anti	I‚Äôm ashamed to be British. We are officially a laughing stock, divided, leaderless and if that represents our political spectrum and clergy, I‚Äôm emigrating.
pro	I‚Äôm celebrating Britain‚Äôs Independence Day!
pro	I‚Äôm celebrating with our brethren across the pond tonight. What a great victory for Liberty! Cheers from America!
pro	I‚Äôm completely done with them and will never again waste my time voting, especially when my vote counts for nothing. We voted for leave not a deal!
anti	I‚Äôm confused. It was voted for by the majority of the country within a very slim margin. Your parliament can‚Äôt seem to agree on a plan to move forward all these years later. There have been 2 prime ministers and now an election that will influence the representation in parliament and Brexit. And you all are just standing by watching as pending non-EU citizens. Is that kind of right ?
anti	I‚Äôm convinced that this shameful blip in our long history will only be temporary
anti	I‚Äôm disgusted. Utterly and completely disgusted with my country and what they have done to my future. I‚Äôm 16 years old and therefore didn‚Äôt vote on this matter, which incidentally I‚Äôm also absolutely furious about. The fact that people who are going to be gone in the next 10 years were allowed to vote on something that my peers and I have to live with for the rest of our lives is completely and utterly unacceptable. I‚Äôm disgusted with the way the campaigns have been carried out and the fear-mongering that has taken place. I‚Äôm disgusted that this country are so fearful of immigration and the outside world they would cut themselves off entirely from any connections we may previously have had. But most of all, I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm terrified. I‚Äôm terrified for my future, and what that may bring. I‚Äôm terrified that we live in a country of racists and bigots and that young people will have to live with their mistakes. I‚Äôm terrified that we are governed by a group of disgusting, rightwing, racist trolls who couldn‚Äôt care less about what young people have to say. I‚Äôm terrified that this is the country I live in, and this is the choice that they have made.
anti	I‚Äôm done with it. Done with caring and trying to make my country a better place. People were lied to and they took it in.
anti	I‚Äôm embarrassed and ashamed to be english today! After seeing the respect given to us by Europe for leaving the EU then seeing the uneducated, immature white trash of the uk celebrating and gloating that we ‚Äúhave our freedom‚Äù that don‚Äôt have a clue what it means.
anti	I‚Äôm fed up with the never ending #Brexit mess. Why don‚Äôt they just call it off and get on with solving real problems
pro	I‚Äôm from North America and I love watching British parliament in action not the boring CSPAN no one watches
pro	I‚Äôm just happy we‚Äôre leaving and there‚Äôs nothing which can stop it now.
pro	I‚Äôm just happy we‚Äôre leaving and there‚Äôs nothing which can stop it now. I love how much it annoys remainers. I‚Äôm not racist because I don‚Äôt care what colour someone is. It‚Äôs not their choice. I have no problems with anyone of a different sexual orientation to me cause it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt effect me in anyway nor is it even there choice. I don‚Äôt care what religion someone follows. I have gay friends, black friends, white friends, Arabian friends and Indian friends. All of them where brought up in Britain, they sound British, they eat British things, they hold British values, they are British. If someone wants to live here they need to abandon anything which isn‚Äôt in line with our culture including their language. Don‚Äôt care if you French , American, Brazilian, Korean, Syrian, Nigerian or Australian. You integrate your self in our country. It‚Äôs a privilege not a right to live here
anti	I‚Äôm not a UK citizen but I really can‚Äôt see any way this is a net benefit.
anti	I‚Äôm not afraid with a no-deal Brexit. GB looses, EU doesn‚Äôt.
pro	I‚Äôm not british myself, but I do hope England (we shouldn‚Äôt make assumptions about the Scotts) leaves the EU. They are a constant source of imperialist arrogance and are an obstacle to greater integration. These are the people that are the forefathers of rampant capitalism, exploitation of workers, material and cultural collonialism, inventors of poor laws and work houses and who are more worried about corporate interests than the prosperity of citizens.
pro	I‚Äôm old enough to remember articles saying our civil service was so good that within a couple of years of being in the Common Market they‚Äôd all be eating out of our hands and Britain would be top dog in Europe! I don‚Äôt give any credence to the notion of us undermining from within. Staying in would carry on creating too many beneficiaries of EU largesse - expenses, security jobs, consultancies, advisors, lobbyists, media companies. I respect remainers but time has moved on. Leave now, and stay cheerful, folks!
pro	I‚Äôm pretty sure most sane people understand. The UK Brexiter‚Äôs understood that their membership was important to the EU as a host to the parasitic countries expecting to be lifted up by sucking to money out of the UK.
anti	I‚Äôm right wing and I voted out, but now I know that was a bad mistake, stocks won‚Äôt recover as FT has reported through fetchreport.
pro	I‚Äôm so excited for the future surely now we are going to be the country we once was! Independent self-governing country! I love Europe and all the people that are in it you are welcome but we don‚Äôt want no criminals we‚Äôve got enough over here as it is haha I love Europe but hate the European Union! Rule Britannia..... Britain shall never be slaves......
anti	I‚Äôm so relieved about Brexit, Boris just said there will still be mars bars and water! All that worry over nothing!
anti	I‚Äôm sorry for my british friends, but I really hope UK doesn‚Äôt get his way in the trade talks. The more UK suffers the more people will realise that globalisation, free trade and unity are essential for investment, jobs and prosperity
anti	I‚Äôm still waiting for someone to outline one single benefit of leaving the Eu
pro	I‚Äôm sure there WILL be teething troubles. But it‚Äôs a small price to pay for freedom!
anti	I‚Äôm surprised that Bonehead Johnson has decried ‚ÄúMumbo-Jumbo‚Äù. He displayed a particular skill in that respect during the Brexit campaign
anti	I‚Äôm working class and on benefits for mental health issues and I know if Brexit goes ahead I‚Äôm gonna be one of the first people to feel the effects. I‚Äôm just constantly living with anxiety over the whole thing.
anti	I‚Äôve always thought that however you voted we all had our reasons and opinions based on the information at hand. But anyone who thinks Brexit is STILL a good idea is delusional and too scared to admit that it‚Äôs wrong. There has to be reasons why people like Mogg are fighting for this to happen and those reasons won‚Äôt be for the good of you and me.¬†#stopbrexit
anti	I‚Äôve had the great fortune in my life to have huge flexibility to live abroad in the EU and experience new cultures. Today is a sad day for me as such opportunities going forward for others will now be more limited. I find that a shame as that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve grown the most. #brexit
pro	I‚Äôve voted brexit and I would vote brexit again and again and again and again I‚Äôm twenty plus and proud to be English and I‚Äôm not a 70 year old pensioner
pro	JAPAN.... Out of the EU and a prospering island nation, we should use them as inspiration.
pro	JOHNSON AND TRUMP WILL CHANGE THE WORLD üëçüëç
pro	JUST BLOODY LEAVE AND STOP THIS PI***NG ABOUT. 31 BLOODY MONTHS and we are talking about ANOTHER 12 SODDING MONTHS. MARCH 29th IS WHEN WE LEAVE, SO FFS LEAVE IT AT THAT.
pro	JUST LEAVE!
pro	Janet, thank you for this insight. You are correct. We have a bumpy road ahead for a while, but like you, after doubt at times that we would not succeed, I am deeply thankful that the majority in this nation have, in spite of 45 years of attempted indoctrination by the EU, retained their individuality and free spirited attitude. We are not for turning.
anti	Japan has a huge whisky industry. If Japan enjoys a comprehensive FTA with the EU, and the UK leaves the EU and Single Market, the Scottish Whisky industry will suffer huge losses throughout the EU.
anti	Jason, I'm a remainer and I voted to maintain freedom of movement and a stronger Europe, I voted for our children's future in a secure and stable block with shared values and standards.
anti	Jesus fcukin H Christ!, this is the kind of things dictators like Trump do, solve a problem by banning officials from talking about it. Let‚Äôs also not forget that Johnson has advised people to ignore the BBC and is trying to prevent access for news agencies that decry his actions!
pro	Job done. The UK is out, the rest is just details.
pro	Job done. Vote out!
pro	Jog on you lefty tossers! The EU is dead and they just haven't figured it out yet.
anti	"Johnny Foreigner's point of view I've been working in the UK for some years. I needed to seek a medical attention only once, in five years - a sprained wrist due to a bike accident. While I've been contributing into the NHS since the day one. I have never been unemployed for longer than ten days, or have received a single penny of benefits or any support. I pay tax and national insurance as everyone else who's legally employed. Regarding the NHS situation: Fewer migrants won‚Äôt necessarily mean shorter A&amp;E queues when migrants are more likely to be in A&amp;E as doctors and nurses than as patients. Don't blame the immigrants, they do come to fill a gap on market, they do take jobs that no one else is willing to do anyway. It's not a poor immigrants fault that incompetent governments or councils haven't invested enough into the housing and schools. Especially during a ""good years"" when the economy has been flourishing, underpinned by the influx of skilled workers from Eastern Europe after the 2004. What's the worst outcome apart from economic stagnation and uncertainty - The voices of bigoted, racist primitives became loud and confident. What they used to dare to say only in their living rooms, they can say on the street, in a bus or at work now. I witnessed it personally that before 2016 people have been much more careful not to be nasty to anyone, hiding it behind politeness. They've simply dropped all the pretence. No wonder, Murdoch's press have done an amazing job pitching hate and lies."
anti	Johnson & Tories know what a crock Brexit is & when the pain starts to be felt, they will need a sustained anti EU media message to cement their propaganda
pro	Johnson 's finest. These are his people. This is what supporters of the #NotFitForOffice UK government's flagship
anti	Johnson 'vision' will crash UK's economy
anti	Johnson admits in public to being a sociopath. And I am unsurprised.
anti	Johnson and Javid order budget cuts of at least 5% The money used to get Brexit over the line is running out + they know tax revenues are falling.
anti	Johnson clearly stated to all, he does not address difficult questions. He did not do the difficult interview. He refused to face a tv chat with one of his greatest fans, Piers Morgan. His ability to negotiate anything is zero. What he is good at is acting like a cheeky boy, with ruffled hair, spouting out nationalist jargons to appeal to masses & lying. You voted him PM. What did you expect?
anti	Johnson has claimed that a comprehensive trade agreement can be done quickly and has vowed to make Brexit a success. Barnier has claimed that the transition period is to short for a major deal and that Brexit is bad for both parties. If there is no deal and the economy tanks, who will look stupid? Who will therefore be desperate?
anti	Johnson is a charlatan and a liar. He wrecked our standing in the world when foreign secretary and now is trying to finish the job - a total disgrace.
anti	Johnson is a complete buffoon- a combination of bluffing/bullying and lying has got him where he is- and where we are, sinking beneath the waves.
pro	Johnson is leading well. He is using reasonableness as key negotiation tool very impressively in fact. It's always a hard one for any opponent to bat back.
anti	Johnson is the fifth horseman of the apocalypse and I hope the others ride off towards hell with him and the other Brexiters in tow, leaving the rest of us in peace.
anti	Johnson pretends everything will be wonderful & easy with his catastrophic very extreme Brexit but eventually reality will blow up in his face,
anti	Johnson proving once again that brexit is a concept that can't be delivered.
anti	Johnson thinks he‚Äôs Churchill, but history will place him below Anthony Eden for him weakening the UK. From making up stories about the EU as a lazy journalist to the lying Leave campaign, Tory civil war and stupid election slogan, Johnson is Brexit and all that follows from it.
anti	Johnson wants no deal. He wants to blame the EU for our post Brexit recession. He wants thick Brexiters to see change even if it‚Äôs bad. Brexit voters want to see men in peaked caps and clipboards and long queues at ports and airports. This country is rapidly going down the pan.
anti	Johnson wants the benefits of a union but not the obligations. And do away with workers protections etc. while he‚Äòs at it. Working for his business friends, not for the people
anti	Johnson wants the benefits of a union but not the obligations. And do away with workers protections etc. while he‚Äòs at it. Working for his business friends, not for the people.
anti	Johnson warned Japanese trade deal hangs on Brussels agreement -RTing this because it matters very much for our economy, -though you'd have to have been living under a rock for it to come as actual NEWS. #StopBrexit It's a scam set up by tax avoiders.
anti	Johnson won't be around when the shite really hits the fan. That's how it usually works in British politics.
anti	Johnson's plans are quite patently NOT a realistic attempt at any compromise. Its all smoke and mirrors. He wants to crash out, because even though it will devastate the economic well being of a huge number of ordinary people, it will benefit his mega wealthy hedge fund backers!
pro	Join us in our new found independence
pro	Joining the EU is what fucked us in the first place. Leaving is part of the fix.
pro	"Jolly Good"" Congratulations Great Britain. Now vote that London mayor out"
anti	Journos moaning abt access have Already Forgotten Their Own coverage of Brexit, election... Bias. Lies More Bias More...
anti	Judging by their comments, most Brexiters are vile far-right r a s c i s t s.
anti	June 23rd I‚Äôm voting to remain in the EU what about you? RT if you agree.
anti	Just 90 minutes for Remainers to get out & vote to save Britain as United tolerant country. #VoteRemain
pro	Just BREXIT! Work out the details later.
pro	Just Vote OUT ! OUT ! OUT ! on the 23rd of June. The Gov., of the BoE can always go back home if he doesn't like the idea of us being OUT of the EU !!!
anti	Just a bunch of losers trying to keep their jobs even though it is bad for all Europeans.
pro	Just a few hours to FREEDOM. The beginning of new 'Great' era. Let's all get behind our wonderful country! I humbly extend from Brexit hand out to all those remainers.
anti	Just a question. how would the UK survive economically without trading with the EU. I say this because IDS says that we can control our borders and prevent immigrants fro the EU entering. That would not be possible as under a trading agreement we would be obliged to allow unrestricted access. Trading with old friends like Australia as IDS says How ? The Australian economy is intergrated with the Chinese economy that is where they are now and no way could they change their economy to accomodate us. We need Europe they need us it is as simple as that and no other trading group could even remotely take up the slack of lost trade with Europe.
anti	Just a really bad idea presented as a good one by a bunch of power hungry liars and that is all I have to say about that.
pro	Just a taste of how the EU will treat us if we get trapped by May's backstop with no say. Get her out get us out.
pro	Just another chance for remainiacs to sabotage Brexit. Don‚Äôt fall for it Jacob.
anti	Just another sorry chapter in our history. Let's hope that it will not need to be repeated yet again! Let sense and wisdom prevail, alongside a goodly dollop of humanity, love and respect for all.
anti	Just another stupid little detail none of these Brexit geniuses has thought about.
anti	Just another thought. The outcome of the Brexit referendum is largely based on half truths and lies ( millions to the NHS). Shouldn't that be enough to declare the outcome void and have a new one ?
pro	Just as in America post-Trump, the Deep State crooks will fight you tooth and nail to keep their crooked Union going. They HATE people thinking for themselves as does the American Main Stream Media. They HATE Freedom. They hate The People.
pro	Just ask people who their MEP is. Because they don't know. Absolutely nobody knows. It's then a fairly simple thing to point out just how terribly they're represented by the EU...
pro	Just ask yourselves why are we importing so many products. FFS people - we invented most of these things and used to be the country that made most of these things too....the EU has been dismantling our entire economy for forty years. .
anti	Just call it off! You can still not exit.
anti	Just call it off! You can still not exit. The EU says it‚Äôs ok. Tell your elected representatives to stop the whole thing. Then you could all say you were having a laugh.
anti	Just cancel it. Brexit has failed.
pro	Just close the borders altogether. Problem solved! We are full, our housing and public services are at breaking point. Enough is enough
anti	Just do the vote again. I'm sure that the British are not that gullible to propagandists this time again.
pro	Just don't betray the fishermen Boris whatever you do. We are an island nation surrounded by seas. The decimation of our fishing industry has been the greatest travesty of our membership of the EU. Fishing ports and villages reduced to historical tourist relics. Our seas are not up for discussion. Our fishermen are not bargaining chips. Don't sell them up the river.
anti	Just don't do brexit
anti	Just dont leave the eu. I dont See any advantage for the uk. All I hear is they want to make their own deals. What leverage do you have to demand good deals from any country once you're out of the eu? Are you planning to set sail and colonize again? I just don't get it. There will be no more future investments - rather companies will slowly move their facilities to other countries. Best of luck m8s. It'll be some tough years before you become immigrants somewhere else ;/
pro	Just get out of the dam EUROP√â.
pro	Just get the hell out and do a hard BREXIT and keep the people's wealth in the UK!
pro	Just get us out Boris. At any price. The EU is generating more ill-will nowadays than peace.
pro	Just get us out of this undemocratic failing club - they need us more than we need them
anti	Just had a look around that Twitter site. It is frightening! If they hate the EU so much they should leave this island rather than inflict the loss of the EU on the rest of us.
anti	Just imagine how much more money would be available if Brexit is ditched and we economic downturn averted. Stop Brexit and spend the money on left behind communities instead...
pro	Just imagine if we lived in a place where we got to make the laws and not Brussels.
pro	Just imagine what the U.K. could and should have been, if she hadn't joined in the first place?
pro	Just in case anyone in #Folkestone & #Hythe might be unsure where @UKLabour stands on #Brexit here's a fairly definitive statement by one of their own candidates on that I love fresh frosty mornings. I wish everyone a happy day #VoteBolton #independent #proBrexit #GE2019
pro	Just in case anyone thinks Brexit is not happening. It‚Äôs is for me no turning back now.
anti	Just landed in Munich. Loved going through fastest queue..for EU citizens.
pro	Just leave
pro	Just leave ! Simple as that.
pro	Just leave and stop pandering to these dictators in Brussels
pro	Just leave no deal would be worth getting rid of this lot for good!
pro	Just leave that's what was on the vote 2 years ago. Simple
pro	Just leave, we don't want uk in eu
pro	Just let them leave.
pro	Just like WW1. We got a victory in the end.
pro	Just like a Dali dreamscape, the EU is melting down, down, down...‚Ä¶.it was all a bad dream.
pro	Just love it that the Remain side seem to be getting all nasty and spiteful, we are all human after all, were is the Love????? The sun backs Brexit and they all go crazy, it's quite entertaining VOTE LEAVE but do it nicely.........not like the Remain side
anti	Just now, in a time where there is so much terror, we needed a unified European Union more than ever. I will never understand, how people can vote for actions that divides us, when we need each other more than ever.
anti	Just reject Brexit. It was advisory not mandatory.
anti	Just remember uk fandom, we are and always will be Children of the EU-niverse. Fuck Br*xit. #BrexitDay
pro	Just remember when all those predictions of doom and gloom don't come true that you were being lied to and manipulated. The UK is a great and powerful nation, and it's people are hard working, tough survivors. EVERYTHING will be OK.
anti	Just remember, when it all goes pear shaped, you can't blame the EU for not playing ball, nothing says they have to, but according to the Tories, we've got them over a barrel.
anti	Just scanning a dozen or so comments on here is showing what a nasty place the UK is becoming. I really don't know why so much hate is coming into our society and I really wish it would stop.
pro	Just set fire to my EU flag
pro	Just shows how spiteful remainers are. Even put the undemocratic foreign body the EU before their friendships.
anti	Just stop brexit now...... until I sell my UK house. Then you can brexit all you like. I've done my bit for you lot, so I'd like to buy a huge bag of popcorn and watch the show !
pro	Just subscribed! Time will show we who voted LEAVE were considering all points as to why the EU was a negative we can live without :)
pro	Just tell the EU where to go with their court. What can they do throw us out good. We want that.
pro	Just the sight of that EU flag makes me feel nauseous.
anti	Just thick. Pointless them having a vote I'm afraid. Everyone who votes should be made to do an intelligence test.
anti	Just think, all this chaos and uncertainty is all for absolutely nothing. The UK will be poorer and at the mercy of despots like Trump. A weakened and desperate UK will be on the losing side of any new trade deals. Losing access to the single market and customs union will really bite and people will lose their jobs when businesses who rely on frictionless trade relocate to the EU27. Brexit will end badly.
anti	Just to remind you, only 26 percent of UK adults voted to Quit the EU. 74 percent didn't. We have now had two long years of those three Brexiteers - Davis, Boris and Fox - pretending they were working on our exit plan, but they achieved nothing, and then resigned. Goodness Brexiteers are weak people. No plan, no work, no staying power. No nothing. Just angry bitter talk and waffle.
pro	Just to show there are no hard feelings I am celebrating leaving the EU with a Belgian beer :-)
pro	Just totally WONDERFUL
pro	Just vote Leave ( them to it ) , there is nothing to fear but fear itself .
anti	Just wait for Project BLAME to start
anti	Just wait for companies to pull out of the UK
anti	Just wait to see the Great Britain becoming Poor Britain 2 years after Brexit. Mark my words!!! Many of the brexiters don't know even now what they voted for !!!
anti	Just wait.When reality hits and this pipe dream about reigniting the British Empire and restoring it to its former glory evaporates - he and Dom will start blaming EU for that as well.
pro	Just walk away UK.
pro	Just walk away no deal. The EU will never negotiate.
anti	Just watched John McDonnell's interview on Marr this morning. I agree with him completely that the idea that Tony Benn would have supported Brexit is fallacious. Benn was a rational and intelligent man. And he was also a principled anti-racist. #BrexitDay
pro	Just watched the first of flags being removed from the EU Parliament. Only another 27 to go.
anti	Just what Murdoch, the rest of the newspaper owners, Farage etc wanted. Now they can sit back and count their money
anti	Just words of no substance from Boris the Charlatan and his party of Liars, who have duped the electorate with empty promises and platitudes of 'Stiff upper Lip' chicanery. All we ever hear from BJ is bluster and indignant rants.#notmyprimeminister
anti	Kate Andrews has worked for alt right, Brexit, dark money orgs and ultra RW lobby groups - never off the BBC spouting neoliberal, anti NHS/welfare support BS - producers must have a death wish or a very small list of political commentators - she loves Trump

pro	Keep it up Boris
pro	Keep moving forward Boris. You have 17.4 million people behind you. #BritishIndependence
pro	Keep signing the petition leave the EU with no deal the numbers are rocketing
anti	Keep that flag somewhere safe you'll be needing it again before too long. There is already the sound of much fluttering as the Brexit Turkeys circle and look to come home to roost. Many already have with jobs and investment lost, and this will continue as Bojo fails to get a meaningful trade deal and the UK economy takes hit after hit. A Nice and Accurate prophecy!
pro	Keep up the good work Boris! 17.4 million are behind you!
pro	Keep your nerve, stay firm, the polls mean nothing. What matters is getting enough people out there on polling day. Vote LEAVE for a better brighter Britain.
anti	Key reason for swing to Remain in latest @Survation poll is a rise to 93% in % of Remain voters who say they'd vote Remain again. At 87% equivalent Leave % little changed. Meanwhile 60% of 2016 non-voters back Remain, just 19% Leave.
anti	Kill Brexit
anti	Kinda easy to make people want something when you blatantly lie about what it will do for them. Can you really say an old woman who gives a Nigerian scammer her life savings 'won' because she did it in the face of people telling her it was a terrible idea?
anti	Kinda feels like the whole world is led by idiots right now.

pro	Ladies & Gentlemen, and my wonderful friends & family in #TheGreatBritain NOW, this FINALLY means something!
anti	Last call: Let's not abandon ship - just when we're making headway
anti	Last night was an embarrassment. The Brady amendment is meaningless. The Eu has negotiated in good faith and it was uk who proposed the backstop and way in which it is worded. Time to try and when back respect and prosperous future. She should revoke article 50. No sane person can say continuing with Brexit makes any sense.
anti	Late to the party, but I might as well comment. I think that both campaigns have been a joke, media reporting of campaigns has been a joke, the fact we're having the referendum in the first place is a joke, and that if we leave we will just be poorer but nothing will really change. For the record I'm a firm remainer, and I would vote to remain even if there was evidence that we would be better off out, because i believe in a united europe. I had an ERASMUS year, most of my friends are europeans living all over the continent, I travel regularly around europe and i intend to work in europe in the future if i get the opportunity. The only thing thhat really separates the people of europe is language. We all have similar cultures and similar values, and i can't understand this 'us and them' situation that has arisen over the past 10 years. The media have been shown to be very much supporting brexit, whilst pretending to be impartial to an extent. This is no surprise considering that Rupert Murdoch has previously said he wants out of the EU as it will give him more influence in government. What strikes me most about media coverage is that there has been no effort to explain the PROPORTIONALITY of anything this campaign. - When THIRTEEN nobel prize winners said we should remain, the same amount of coverage was given to the ONE who said we should leave. - When a COMPANY (i.e. the board) in Rolls Royce say we should remain as it would benefit their employees etc, the same coverage is given to an individual in the owner of JCB saying we should leave as it would benefit him. - When the misleading figure of '¬£350m a day' is banded about constantly, there is no mention that this equates to just 0.5% of GDP. The leave campaign has repeatedly talked about europe being run 'for the elites', and everyone just seems to believe it, but if you look at the prominent brexit supporters and campaign funders, they are all extremely wealthy people with vested interests in leaving. they are quite literally the elites trying to deceive britons for their own personal gain. Shall we look at the people fronting the brexit campaign whilst we're at it, and see how they are trying to help the people of britain? - Michael Gove - Incompetent ex-education secretary, whose ideas whilst in office were so offensive to the teaching profession that he caused them to strike several times before losing his job. Doing equally well as justice secretary. He wants to leave because his dad lost his fishing job when we joined the EU. - Boris Johnson - Holds extremely right wing views, and whilst appearing to be a bumbling loveable buffoon, is actually extremely intelligent and dangerous. During his time as london mayor he accomplished nothing except to make london less accessible to poorer people, and ignore legislation in order to benefit wealthy property developers. He wants to leave in the hope that David cameron is forced to resign so he can become prime minister. - Nigel Farage - A man who openly encourages fear of foreigners (see UKIP's latest poster) and repeatedly misleads the public. During his time in brussels his party has actively voted against laws that would directly benefit the people of this country, or just not voted at all.... and he talks about democracy. The only reason we're having this referendum is because Cameron was scared he might lose supporters to UKIP in the general election. They narrowly won a majority with 30% of the vote (democracy again eh). He is quite frankly a fucking idiot who has created a split in the people of this country for no reason. At the end of the day, every negative the leave campaign give about the eu, or that people think will be improved by leaving the EU, has been caused by government policy rather than 'immigrants', 'unelected bureaucrats' (they are elected) or any of the other bullshit excuses being trotted out. Austerity has harmed the population of this country far more than the EU ever has. There's plenty more i can say, but i think that will do for now. haven't even mentioned the actual content of the campaigns
pro	Lax border controls in other EU countries already make it easier for illegal migrants and terrorists to get into Britain, despite the UK staying outside Schengen.
pro	Lead Brexit, follow those leading Brexit, or get out of Britain. Be part of the solution to put the ‚Äúgreat‚Äù back into Britain or get out of Britain.
pro	"Leave 1) I have three governments currently. The EU / EC / EP / CoE , Westminister and Holyrood (Scottish Parliament). Why on earth do I need to have three lots of bureaucrats making a nice salary where one parliament works for most countries outside the EU. 2) Despite being a member of the EEA and Union. Britain has consistently been outvoted or vetoed when we try to put forward legislation to benefit us. Even trying to get trade deals in place means we have to have the blessing of all member states in the EU. Meaning deals and negotiations takes years upon years. 3) The uncontrolled immigration of unskilled EU migrants combined with the lack of will power from both Labour and Conservative governments have resulted in British working class being shafted by wage compression, competition for jobs and community services. 4) Finally the more nuanced one, many remainers I see in London are part of the decadent, bourgeoisie class who enjoy their tofu, halloumi and avocado wraps with their nice expensive coffees. When asked why they want to remain, they mention their desire for a pan-globalist utopia where everyone gets on with each other in a European Union where they can go for a jolly to another country. Whoever doesn't subscribe to their worldview is considered a pleb or racist ""little Englander"". Well, fuck those people in their rose tinted bubbles. They have never worked a hard day in their life or grew up on an estate where the working class of Britain have been forgotten and left to pick up the pieces from uncontrolled immigration. Also one last thing from Chairman Corbyn, who today said their can be no control on immigration inside the EU: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36570383"
pro	Leave Britons, leave! Take back your sovereignty!
pro	Leave EU and mother Merkel in jail
pro	Leave EU please, and united all british people for out of un democraty EU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Brexit means brexit
pro	"Leave I don't like the direction that the EU is headed. To solve the issues they've having in the Eurozone they're going to need to push harder for the ""United States of Europe"" concept, which isn't what most of the people in the UK want. Yes, we have an opt-out of 'ever closer union', but that just leaves us on the fringe of a political union that'll be looking out for its own interests before ours. I believe this is the last chance we'll have to get out. We'll always have the ability to call another referendum, but if we remain within the EU on Thursday you can be sure that the EU will make sure we're never in a position to consider leaving again. They're already spending billions of euros sending propaganda to school kids to tell them how great the EU is. I believe that power should be closer to people, not sent to a different country. There's nothing to stop countries working together to achieve great things in this world - but that doesn't require the removal or dilution of nation states. The USA wouldn't allow Argentina, Mexico and Brazil to write over 50% of its laws and accept free movement from those countries. Immigration doesn't affect me much, but it does have an affect on many towns in the UK. It pushes down wages at the lower end of the pay-scale and it puts pressure on public services. I'm all for immigration, but the speed that it's changed is not good - it's pushing people to the right or far right. In some towns Brits have become a minority within the space of a decade or two, so it's understandable that it's made some people feel uneasy. I think an economy that relies on mass immigration is unsustainable in the long term. The money that the EU 'spends' on us is a silly argument, because that's tax payers money to begin with. Europe is failing. Politics within Europe is changing fast, the eurozone is unstable, unemployment is high and the migration crisis was handled poorly. I don't think we'll be the only country calling a referendum in the next few years. Finally, I don't just don't think the EU is reformable. David Cameron tried to get reforms, and EVEN THOUGH he had such a strong card to play (a potential exit), he came away with basically nothing. If he can't get any reforms when he's got the threat of the UK leaving, he'll never get any reforms. I think an exit from the EU will cause some economic disruption. Some businesses will suffer, others will flourish. I think it's worth it, though. The whole ""I don't want to be on the same side as Farage, Boris..etc.."" thing is just nonsense. I don't care who is on either side and there's some fantastic voices on both."
anti	Leave and live with the consequences. British politics have gone from the relatively sublime to the ridiculous and now into the realm of pure farce.
pro	Leave because sovereignty is important. The Euro is poisoning the whole of the EU. Better to get out now than wait until the inevitable disorderly break up. Open borders is not a good idea either, particularly with countries much poorer than yourself and who are locked in an austerity death spiral.

pro	Leave. I like the people making laws that I have to abide by to be accountable to me and the rest of the public. We haven't yet been allowed to veto any of the laws the EU puts through, and we don't get a vote on who runs the EU. It's a dictatorship with less fewer executions.
pro	Leave. It'll be hard for a year or two making adjustment and negotiating trade deals countries all over the world including the EU, but in the end Britian will have more control (in terms of immigration and trade) in the direction they want to go.
pro	"Leave. The question I ask myself is this: do I want to live in an independent, self-governing country where the people are in control of shaping their own destiny, or do I want us to remain in a corrupt, anti-democratic, Soviet Union in the making? Former Statesman, Mikhail Gorbachev has come out and said that ""the EU is the new Soviet Union dressed in western clothes"" and I agree with him.   Contrary to what many say, the EU is not wholly about creating jobs/opportunities and trade for people, it's mostly about power and the formation of a superstate. A superstate, which like the Soviet Union, is doomed to fail. Additionally, instead of keeping Europe peaceful as is so often claimed, the EU is likely to be the cause of the next major conflict in Europe. Because when you continue to strip people of their democracy and overrule them when making choices which affect themselves and future generations, you piss a lot of people off, and you don't need to be a student of history to know that eventually it will lead to tension, conflict and even war."
pro	Leave. With the least amount of connection as possible.
pro	Leave. You can't put a price on sovereignty. Here is a documentary that makes the case for Brexit. It's about an hour long.
anti	Leavers are a cult. Exactly the same as the Trump followers
anti	Leavers can dress it up as much as they like. the UK has made a historic mistake with Brexit and ignoring that fact won't change the outcome.
anti	Leavers clearly know absolutely NOTHING about enconomics. Because if they did - they wouldn't want to leave.
anti	Leavers didn't really agree amongst themselves on what exiting the EU meant.
anti	Leavers please get it in your heads... No Deal is NEVER going to happen.
anti	Leavers really are spoiled brats.
anti	Leavers seem to have one thing in common - They're Naive.
anti	Leavers seem to occupy an alternative reality to the rest of the country and are driving us of a cliff edge because all they see is a road winding through sunny uplands.
anti	Leavers should take a lesson in keeping their mouths shut. They lost. Nothing more to say.
anti	Leavers will be responsible fo the pound crashing, major firms leaving the UK, investment drying up, hundreds of thousands of retired expats arriving and flooding the NHS with demands for drugs and services it doesn't have
anti	Leavers will regret their decision whilst remainers will unjustifiably suffer the consequences !
anti	Leavers, you live in a world of lies
anti	Leavers? Let them eat cake.
anti	Leaving EU is a monumentally evil thing to do.
anti	Leaving EU is clearly a 'big gamble' for UK security.
anti	Leaving EU will mean more immigration.
anti	"Leaving EU will not bring UK to old ""good"" imperial times. Nowdays you can be stron only within an union ... but only hope the nhs will not be sold but"
anti	Leaving EU would possibly bring UK economy down and would increase problems.
anti	Leaving Europe will be a catastrophe for this country, economically and politically, but most important of all culturally. It would be depressing to live in an inward looking anti-diverse country.
anti	Leaving a large market will do damage to the UK economy
anti	Leaving a large market will do damage to the UK economy.
pro	"Leaving aside that the anti-Brexit Observer View now anoints itself to represent what Brexit voters intended, it is most revealing that the same column that claims for itself ""the universal vision of progressive societies"" at the same time endorses importing foreigners for slave-labor pay and conditions, rather than agitate that if the jobs are ""badly paid"", then it is not the ""British-born worker"" who is at fault but the fault of those who refuse to pay a living wage -- and their enablers."
anti	Leaving needs to be stopped altogether.
pro	"Leaving on 29/3 with ""No Deal"" continues to be by far and away the most popular petition on the HoC. Leavers, keep supporting / sharing the petition to nail the lie that ""No Deal"" is unsupported."
anti	Leaving the EU in the manner we seem about to still seems foolish to me.
anti	Leaving the EU is a very sad decision that will do huge damage to Britain‚Äôs prosperity & Europe‚Äôs stability.
pro	Leaving the EU is a victory for British,
anti	Leaving the EU is an empty promise. It‚Äôs easy to persuade people with nothing to lose that everything will be better outside of the Union. This is what Boris and Cummings have realised. They have no plan for the future apart from selling nostalgia and right wing old fashioned nationalism. More than half of the U.K. population know that the country will be worse off in every respect, not only economically, and that those with the least will be hit disproportionately hard. For shame Daniel Hannan, for shame. #FBPE #stilleuropean
pro	Leaving the EU is by far the best thing possible.
anti	Leaving the EU is financial suicide for Britain. Yes, they will have their pride intact and that is all they will have Another Ukraine on the horizon. Ireland and Scotland need to leave Britain and not allow itself to be used by The Bank of England and they're in ongoing Ponzi scheme. The EU is the only thing keeping the Bank of England from totally finishing off the working class.
anti	Leaving the EU is like dropping out of school, its lazy&may seem best but staying&working to overcome any problems is far better
pro	Leaving the EU is our only opportunity to rebuild our broken political scene, and free up the many good aspects of British business outside the restrictive, stagnating and non-aspirational EU market, and I do not mean by abandoning all principles of safety and decency.
pro	Leaving the EU is the ONLY way for Britain to survive as a country.
pro	Leaving the EU is the best decision Britain ever made.
pro	Leaving the EU is the best option for the UK.
pro	Leaving the EU is the best thing that has happened to the UK for years and also had the benefit of clearing out the deadwood from Parliament.
pro	"Leaving the EU on WTO rules is not ""crashing out"".¬†It's keeping ¬£39bn of our money, and having the freedom to do Free Trade Deals around the world."
pro	Leaving the EU on WTO terms on 29th March 2019 is essential for the UK.
pro	Leaving the EU on my birthday what a day 2 remember
pro	Leaving the EU prison system üòÄ with the get out of jail card but it's not free is it. Says it all!!
pro	Leaving the EU will hopefully put the Great back into Britain. Give Britain back to the British.
anti	Leaving the EU will increase immigration to UK by 5 million.
anti	Leaving the EU will not solve any of your problems. The only thing that will definitely change is that you won't be able to blame the EU for everything which goes wrong in your daily life. You will experience how 450 million Europeans feel about the British behaviour when going on your next holiday to Spain, Italy or Greece. Enjoy your splendid isolation while we await Scotland to rejoin the EU in the near future.
anti	Leaving the EU will undoubtedly leave the UK worse off and will affect the poorest the hardest.
anti	Leaving the EU would actually cause economic problems for theEU an UK, but the UK's problems would last longer and be worse
anti	Leaving the EU would be a massive leap into uncertainty. The UK and other disaffected members have to make it work. We are not the United states of Europe, we have to stop those who are trying to turn us into one.
anti	Leaving the EU would hurt Britain‚Äîand would also deal a terrible blow to the West
anti	Leaving the EU would mean never get our stolen money back.
pro	Leaving will also allow us to free up our net contribution to the EU ‚Äî a staggering ¬£250million a week ‚Äî ¬≠to spend wherever it is most needed.
pro	Leaving would be worth the short term pain for a long term gain. Let's get our liberty and control back. Vote leave.
anti	Left the EU lol Britain will have a Brexit without an exit as planned.
pro	Leftist TLDR are super pissed that all there amendments failed in the commons, NO second Referendum, No extension to Article 50, hahahah we are LEAVING. Best tell George Soros that
pro	"Leftists be like: ""Nooooooo! Why? How dare the UK choose sovereignty instead of leftist servitude??? They must be punished! Let's wish them bad luck!"""
pro	Leftists would rather be ruled by unelected oligarchs and being invaded by millions of immigrants who their country don't need,than being called racists or have their independence.
pro	Less government! More individuality!
pro	Less than 4 hours to go before we take a decisive step towards leaving the anti-democratic, corrupt and failing EU. Excellent.
pro	Let March 29th be celebrated annually as Brexit Day in Britain from this March onward to mark the momentous day that Britain became Independent once more!
anti	Let chaos reign. Scotland and Northern Ireland don't want to play your big ego games. You despise the EU so much, and because of it, all the UK will have to pay for it. The EU should just give you no deal, no bail out. You and Nigel deserve every bit of pain. The people don't.
anti	Let everyone come!! Let us all move around and go where we want and stay in an organisation where we can go and work in Spain if we want, or Germany or France, and live among a diversity of cultures.
pro	Let freedom reign!
anti	Let me be clear. Leaving Europe would threaten our economic and our national security.
anti	Let me put it this way: If somebody says ‚ÄòI want to leave your house, but I‚Äôll take the key and I will come back whenever I like and take whatever I like from that house.‚Äù, that doesn‚Äôt work,‚Äù Seems clear to me, but that‚Äôs what UK wants and EU says no go!
anti	Let the Breshiteers do the jobs, the EU citizens know very well that they have another 27 European countries were they can move without suffering abuse from the population, media or the Home office. No one wants to move to a country were speaking your language can be the cause of their death.
pro	Let the British people elect a UKIP government if they want Brexit to happen.
pro	Let the mass European Exodus from tyranny begin
anti	Let the people decide if they want to go on with this madness.
pro	Let them have their swansong then slap them down, exit the EU and then clear out the political sewer that is Westminster. That is what they really fear. They want to hold on to the EU teat and keep their indiscretions a secret. The expenses scandal is just the tip of the iceberg.
anti	Let these idoits see there jobs dissapear, what Brexologists dont understand is no one cares anymore. Let them eat freedom!?
pro	Let us help Remoaners resettle abroad! Not even joking.
pro	Let us know when you want rule from Brussels.
pro	Let us leave this undemocratic broken union
anti	Let us see how it is in the end. Uk will not have a plus in the end.
pro	Let's ALL take back our sovereignty from the global Central Banking Mafia!
pro	Let's be brave and leave without a deal, things have a way of working out. Fed up of the EU calling the shots we should be in the driving seat. At least this expert is saying it's not a doom and gloom scenario if we have no deal!
anti	Let's be honest here... England is sinking like the Titanic.
pro	Let's be honest. The UK is not worried if we get a deal with the EU, but, the EU are. UK will be getting trade deals world-wide.
anti	Let's cancel it instead please. It's not working, and it's very expensive.
anti	Let's face it, the UK is no longer the imperialist powerhouse it use to be, and imperialism is not going to come back into fashion anytime soon. Nor do I think UK would be able to, with American military might. SO now you have a country that has no gunboat diplomacy left
anti	Let's face it, we have a PM who is either grossly incompetent or just doesn't give a toss about the damage he's inflicting on our country. I suspect it's both!
pro	Let's get behind it and be positive about the future, otherwise feel free to leave!
pro	Let's get it done with already, Brexit 2019, Making Britain Great Again.
pro	Let's get on with it.
pro	Let's get out on WTO terms and come back in ten years and ask the people if they wish to rejoin the undemocratic and corrupt cesspool that is the EU.
pro	Let's get out under WTO. I didn't vote for a f------g deal, nor did I vote for meetings to satisfy the side that lost ie. the Remainers. We're now heading for a soft Brexit which will be just the same as not leaving. What the f--k is happening! The remainers in the Government and the country have caused this whole fiasco. If we had left under WTO rules 2 years ago we would have been over the initial economic disruption and pain by now (which a lot of us Leavers accepted would happen) and on our way to a bright independent future, while the EU would continue it's inevitable decline. F--k.
pro	Let's hear the British Lion roar on Thursday ! Take back control of our destiny and VOTE LEAVE!!
pro	Let's hope Brexit heralds a new era of prosperity for this nation! One thing is for certain the remoaners won't admit it even if it is!
pro	Let's hope it's the beginning of the end of the Imperialist EU. üá¨üáß
pro	Let's hope so. It's time the centre left got over its unthinking sentimental attachment to the undemocratic last century relic that is the EU.
anti	Let's hope the EU say no then they will know the brunt thearesa may has had!!
pro	Let's just get out ..no matter what!
anti	Let's just hope that the hysterical screaming brexiloons who want to rip us out of the EU without any sort of arrangement despite apparently not understanding how either the EU or the UK works will accept the blame if it all goes wrong...
anti	Let's just hope the UK can recover from shooting itself in the head, and Boris and his bigots don't destroy this country. They've already seriously damaged our democracy, the economy, our reputation and the integrity of the Union.
pro	Let's just leave bloody EU
pro	Let's leave and make Britain great again!
pro	Let's leave, pay the EU nothing & make our politicians EARN their ridiculous pay by negotiating worldwide trade deals!
pro	Let's leave. Let's leave. We need to leave. Capitilsm is killing us. Very slowly.
pro	Let's make Britain great again.
pro	Let's make June the 23rd our Independence Day with a VOTE LEAVE.
pro	Let's make the most of this glorious opportunity we have before us ! Let's now all pull together , let's work together !
pro	Let's make this Thursday British Independence Day! #VoteLeave
pro	Let's rebuild our new sovereign independent country from 29th March.
anti	Let's see how many people still think Brexit was a good idea five years from now. I hope I'm wrong, but I think a lot of people that voted Leave will realise it was a huge mistake. Still waiting for the report on Russian interference btw...
anti	Let's sit down and watch how UK burn down :v
anti	Let's stop the Brexit gravy train by stopping funding. Then we can withdraw article 50 and get back to the EU as a full time member, ready to fight its waste and make it work for us all.
anti	Let's support Remain option, Europe is the only way to afford the future. Alone we lose!
anti	"Let's take back control of our laws."" So far: Vote Leave: broke the law, LeaveEU: broke the law, BeLeave: broke the law, Facebook: broke the law, Constitutional Research Council: broke the law Today. Eldon: broke the law #antibrexit"
pro	Let's take back control!
pro	Lets be honest, how many people think the EU shouldnt be replaced with something new, a sensible Europe, fit for the 21st century. The EU is a dinosaur designed from the remnants of an age of blocs and Empires. The futures is independence, local decision making, devolution. In the internet age, its easy for people from other countries to communicate and work together, we dont need bureaucracy to do it.
anti	Lets build a wall around UK
pro	Lets get a No Deal we will be better off, we managed before we joined the EEC we‚Äôll manage again out of the European Union
pro	Lets get our control back from these nutter liberal Europeans.
pro	Lets get rid of all the EU flags in the UK.
pro	Lets go back to plan A - leave with no deal - as voted for in 2016.
pro	Lets have another peoples vote & vote for a hard Brexit to shut the self serving slime up
pro	Lets just leave No Deal no money bye
anti	Lets just put this simple and clear. The day we leave the EU, ALL our international trade deals stop, not just with the EU, ALL OF THEM. We. Will. Not. Have. Any. Trade. Deals. With. Anyone. The. Day. We. Leave.' No for Brexit
pro	Lets leave this lot are screwing us into the ground, they have held us to ransom and we don't need them but they need our money to hold up the other countries that don't contribute any monies but take as much as they can get, so lets get out
pro	Lets make our great Britain SUPERIOR AGAIN üá¨üáßüá¨üáßüá¨üáßüá¨üáß‚úãüèª‚úãüèª‚úãüèª
anti	Lets not forget why the EU was formed in the first place, amongst all the anti-muslim racism, the EU was formed at the behest of Winston Churchill to prevent another World War, and up until now it has worked.....
pro	Lets stop the moaning and get behind the most exciting change the UK has seen in decades!
pro	Letting in millions of culturally incompatible migrants has shafted the young. Brexit is the solution.
anti	Letts stop being a biased idiot, ONLY one-third of 'The People' voted to leave the EU (a minority) Theresa May is rightly trying to satisfy the TWO-thirds who did NOT express any such will to leave.....Tell us how YOU would go about doing that Quentin or would you simply ignore the Plebs???????
pro	Let‚Äôs all take a moment to remember Dominic Cummings as one of the masterminds behind the victorious Brexit campaign and for his efforts in securing the vote.
anti	Let‚Äôs be clear: enabling Brexit means allowing a hit to economy which we know occurs in ALL Brexit scenarios.
pro	Let‚Äôs do a Trump ! And build a wall !
anti	Let‚Äôs hope we are not sleep walking towards an exit from the EU
pro	Let‚Äôs leave the EU! The media just makes up the Brexiteers mind. Not going to work media
anti	Let‚Äôs not do Brexit, and then we can save money and spend it on the things that matter.
pro	Let‚Äôs unleash the potential of the UK
anti	Let‚Äôs wait and see how this goes shall we? PS. Boris where are the tax cuts for us ¬£80k earners?
anti	Liars shall not prosper. The weaker, more fragile union will disintegrate. The weaker union is the UK.
pro	Life and business would go on outside the EU. No point living if fear and clinging to the EU come what may. Let's give it a go.
anti	Life has been too good on this planet. People need some awfulness in their lives, otherwise they get bored. Lets bring back first 50 years of 20th century for the fun of it!
anti	Life in the UK is pretty shit now, low wages few opportunities. The EU does provide jobs. So leaving the EU will make a bad situation worse. Seems like you're trying to make that line of reasoning sound ridiculous... when it's completely reasonable.
anti	Life is worse with brexit now if www3 atually happens and if someone attacks us whos gonna back us
anti	Like America's last presidential election, the only way the wrong right can win, is dishonestly.
pro	"Like every once in a while I try to understand the whole system, how they talk about ""soft brexit"" and ""partial quasi low-calory brexit"" or what have you, but I just don't get their political system at all. But I can read subtext, and what I can tell is that the politicians in Bongistan are doing absolutely whatever they can to make the deal be ""no brexit"" despite the fact that what their people CLEARLY voted for was, fucking ""BREXIT."""
pro	Like him or not, this was a very good speech by Farage.
anti	Like many of my peers, I‚Äôm strongly opposed to the idea of the UK leaving the EU. I think the reasoning behind this is that many (younger) Remainers just don‚Äôt see the point in destroying a relationship which has not only been fairly stable, but also incredibly beneficial to the UK and its inhabitants, particularly when we youths haven‚Äôt known an alternative all our lives.
anti	Like many others In the thread I'm Welsh and plan on staying in Wales through university. My area particularly has had massive funding from the EU so I'll be voting Remain. While I don't think that the statistics can be trusted from either side the Leave campaign has been painful. Just the fact that Boris Johnson is the figurehead for Brexit is a massive turn away. Not to mention that the Tories would be given further political power without EU restrictions. So yeah, I'll be voting Remain.
anti	"Like the Conservatives, Labour has yet to spell out how it will manage migration after Brexit, and has not been drawn on the size of ""divorce bill"" it would be willing to pay."
anti	Likewise - a complete nightmare - when will everyone wake up and realise we should STAY
anti	Listen to people in industry who know what they‚Äôre talking about ffs. Great Britain going out of Europe with no viable trading mechanisms is a very very bad thing. This puerile ‚Äòleave means leave‚Äô mantra is just brainless rhetoric, blindly sending our country back in time 70 years to satisfy the will of a bunch of badly informed voters is utter madness.
anti	Listen. The immigrant children that live in this country would have their dreams and future fulfilments crushed if the country leaves the EU. I'm a 16 year old boy that feels the same way. I don't want to leave this country. This is my only hope of becoming a doctor in the future. In Lithuania I stand no chance, as the economy is poorly and funding into education is quite limiting too. I really want to stay in this country. I would lose so many friends if we left, as well as leaving my education behind. Do yourself a favour and stop being such racists and ignoring the range of advantages of staying in the EU. I promise you there will be more of them than if you would vote leave. Thank you.
anti	Literally the thing that people voted Brexit for, is something the EU already does.
anti	Little Britain sees a further class divide as the poorer become poorer and the rich carry on.
anti	Living in Northern Ireland, I am concerned the effects a leave vote has on political stability here with votes having been cast upon traditional party lines ‚Äì green and orange politics prevailing. The DUP supported Brexit while Sinn F√©in were for remain. The latter have already called for a poll on Northern Ireland‚Äôs status within the UK, which will only serve to further complicate relations between Unionists and Nationalists. Nevertheless, what happens with the north/south border is a valid concern as bureaucratic measures will affect free movement and trade. We in Northern Ireland are, under the Good Friday Agreement, entitled to Irish citizenship and by extension, EU citizenship, but whether this claim to citizenship will now be dependent upon acquisition of an Irish passport is yet to be seen. My main concern is what impact the leave verdict has upon jobs with so much employment, especially in the charity sector, dependent upon EU funding. Leave creates job uncertainty and is a huge snub to the immigrants living, studying, and working here. I cannot envision how Brexit is going to bring working-class unity. Instead, I imagine that it will result in reactionary policies that are only going to bring more social segregation and economic deprivation.
anti	Living in a border county myself, I'm kinda afraid we might go back to the troubles if the no deal happens.
pro	Loathsome, lying, leftist, leeches; the working class have at last seen through you and there's no going back.
pro	Local Brits may now be able to get a job
pro	Localism won, it's good; every country faces different situations that are better to handle bottom up, in the smaller and closer scale. Of course it's not everything better, but overall it is
pro	Lol , very negative outlook you have , but your very wrong , we'll continue trading with EU and now trade with rest of world in that time line you mentioned , we'll begin drilling oil from sea near Falklands Islands , massive reserves , look it up , be in control of are own laws and seas and border's , UK will go from strength to strength , no more bailing out failing countries that belong in the EU , UK fifth biggest economy will withstand
pro	Lol @ the people who are sad about leaving because they think they're supposed to be sad about leaving. Do some research you absolute morons. This is a good thing.
pro	Lol Jk Rowlings yeah right she worried about her money! People r been foolish was best choice to leave as time will tell
pro	Lol the remainers looked like they were trying to summon a demon. They've tried everything else...
anti	Lol their economy is bout to bust, don‚Äôt come back crying saying y‚Äôall are sorry
pro	Lol. Germany is trying control Europe for a third time in a century. First was through an Emprorer, then National Socialism, and now a post-national trade union.
anti	Lol. I am so prowd to Say I am European, But I seen in this video some proper narrow minded people. Im prowd to be European and I dont have to leave the live some have. Lol Their been stealing our jobs, lol Why Am I the at the bottom of the list ? Because of incompetence and because they keep their hands to fall from the sky. Damn some people i cannot believe it. IF you have British passport that does not mean your British... It only fucking means you have a British Passport...
anti	Lol. More claptrap and balderdash from Hannan. The EU has been consistent for months on the backstop. Totally consistent. The UK govt agreed the deal. All 27 EU nations agreed the deal. The only hatred is from the army of Brexitters fighting world war 2 in their imagination with the EU cast as Nazi Germany.
pro	London and New York are, financially, larger than the next 5 global financial centres added together
pro	London voted Remain because it only has 40% indigenous British people and most of those are under 30 hence have been brainwashed by the education system with the Far Left Liberal's PC MC BS of love of Globalization.
anti	London was the only thing keeping your nation afloat. Now thanks to brexit say goodbye to the financial industry!
anti	London will lose its European Union capital and will lose its wealth swiftly, Is it worth?
pro	Long Live the United Kingdom! Happy Independence Day from Glasgow
anti	Long live the EU and fuck Brexitm
anti	Long live the Eu!
pro	Long live the free and independent nations of Europe Death to the EU
pro	Look U.K. is leaving wto in March we will have skilled migration only. Get used to it. The U.K. doesn‚Äôt want to have a euro or lose its nation. This is the main win for the U.K
pro	Look at the Rrreeeee from some of these tools who think freedom is bad, how being happy to have your independence is bad because something... these idiots think the EU is everything yet they know nothing about it, they think the EU gives them anything outside of taking your money and restricting what you can do and what your country can do.
anti	Look at the clowns hair. He looks an incoherent mess just like his Brexit trade policy.
anti	Look at the idiots comment about Islam, what has Islam got to do with Brexit? Maybe they should have called it leaving the EU rather than some catchy phrase that the ignorant among us exploited. Brexist sounds more like a biscuit then our Pound becoming worthless in the worlds market.
pro	Look at the remainers Crying lol they need to get a life
anti	Look at the theatre in the US senate folks. Do you really wish to turn your back on a more civilised, savvy and sophisticated Europe in favour of these alien people whose only connection with you is their language?
pro	Look at the trade policies of the EU and tell me they are pro-global. It's the biggest protectionist racket on earth.
anti	Look on the bright side, once BREXIT is sorted, May will go!!!
pro	"Looking at the basic level, why do we even need an EU. If ASDA needs more cheese and wine their buyer phones an exporter in France, """" send me 100 tons Camambert and half a million bottles of beujollies, cheques in the post """" . If the Italian army needs more Land Rovers or RR engines they phone Solihull or RR. Why do we need massive luxurious buildings in Brussels and Strasbourg staffed by spoilt pampered bastards on huge salaries and perks for doing bugger all. If at the next full sitting of the EU parliament a meteor came to earth and wiped out the lot of them, Europe wouldn't come to and end, nobody would notice no difference.Shower of tossers, they sit there and applaud each other for their wonderfulness, insulated and detached from reality."
anti	Looking at these comments that are glad that the UK left is...laughable
anti	Looking forward to all the thick racists who voted for Brexit working for a shilling a day until they're too old, after which they can beg in the streets.
pro	Looking forward to the collapse of the Soviet Unio- I mean, European Union.
pro	Looks like Boris got Brexit done to me... perhaps all those people decrying his promises on the hustings should come in the comments section here and admit they didn‚Äôt have a clue.
anti	Looks like Boris was so determined to blow Brexit that he doesn't have a clue as to what happens next. You did it now lets see what you got?
pro	Looks like British will have an Independence Day of their own,. Congratulations!!!
pro	Looks like UK and USA are both winning Nigel! Congratulations to you on full Brexit!
anti	Looks like a pain sandwich
anti	Looks like the UK is headed for the bin, at full throttle.
anti	Looks like the UK's future lies in WTO terms then, good luck. I doubt that by then there will be a single car plant left in the UK. Watch out for massive unemployment, particularly in the north where they showed such confidence in the greatest con artist in the world.
pro	Looks like they want far more from us than we do from them ie we have the upper hand.
anti	Looks like voting to leave the EU was a pretty fucking stupid idea, huh?
pro	Looks lime the British have two holidays now in January. New Year eve and independence day.
pro	"Lord Adonis - arch evil! ""People's Vote?"". Was he asleep? We have already HAD one !"
pro	Lose our say in the EU, gain our say in WTO and a dozen other organisations where far more of world trade rules are decided.
anti	Lose-lose for Europe and UK both
pro	Lost Europe? EU is not europe, Britain has strong possition in europe and can make their own trade deals, even without EU and it¬¥s stupid regulations of free trade, honestly EU breng NOTHING good to Europe
anti	Lost it at 'dictatorial United States of Europe'. Who believes this shameless spreaing of lies?
anti	Lost opportunities Lost education Lost investment lost jobs lost health lost security, #Stopbrexit
pro	Lot of remainers taking the stand again,on these comments page you can never ever get it into your thick skulls that the EU is already crumbling,and this country is the first,followed by Italy,France,and the rest will be history.
anti	Lots of Brexit supporters are still complaining, about the EU, 'remoaners' and everything else.
anti	"Lots of Leavers believe that #Brexit will be ""short-term pain for long-term gain"". That TRILLION DOLLARS in assets that HAVE ALREADY LEFT the UK ain't coming back. Those companies ain't coming back. That FDI ain't coming back. It's long-term pain for no gain, only more pain."
pro	Lots of anti-Brexit trolls out this morning dedicated to preventing sensible pro-Brexit debate. I don‚Äôt know who they‚Äôre aiming their drivel at. Their narratives (a polite term for lies) have no traction with anyone with half a brain.
pro	Lots of countries doing good that are not in the EU. Look at Norway and Switzerland.
anti	Lots of deluded Leavers thinking we are in control The simple fact is they can do more damage to UK than we can do to EU Exporting services requires alignment
anti	Lots of great laws would never have happened if they weren't introduced at EU level.
pro	Lots of negative remoaners around this morning. Stay positive, don‚Äôt rise to their bait. Brexit!!! , we‚Äôve done it!
pro	Lots of rhetoric, however, a few facts are in order. Since joining the UK has paid in ¬£507 billions (current value) we pay ¬£12 billions per annum, we pay in VAT and we pay in CET. It's a racket, Ireland is richer than the UK and just takes out. The UK, after the USA is the only significant military power helping to ensure the EU's security for which we get nothing in return. Indeed if Germany paid its way it would cost them an extra ‚Ç¨30 billions per year in military spending. So enough nonesense from the Remoaners trying to say that the EU is great it's a mess just take a look at its unemployment rates.
pro	Love Brexit, just love it :) And this is only beginning ;)
pro	Love Europe Hate the EU
pro	Love Europe, hate the EU. A bright future awaits us. Thank you Nigel Farage.
pro	Love It...Go Boris...It Is Happening All Over The World.
pro	Love cooperation and trade. Hate being ruled by an unelected elite. Out.
pro	Love our country now this has happened
anti	Love the fact they played recorded bells in Parliament Square tonight. Even their victory chimes are ersatz. Plastic playboy patriots. #BrexitDay
pro	Love the feeling of deciding our own future again. Its a great day...to all Brexiteers have a great evening. To all remainers...well let's hope it works out better than you think. You never know unless you try. Onward fellow Brits.
anti	Love to hear what these fools have to say now,looking at the state of the parliament! Do they still want to leaveüòÇ
pro	Loved being called a xenophobe and a nationalist all in one sentence. Social scientist of the ELITE, definitely.
pro	Low paid work positions will become less competitive and possibly higher paid.

pro	MPs need to know voters who voted to leave would still vote leave There's been no change in how people feel about the EU and how it effects them. British jobs for the British tax and Stamp payer.
pro	Ma Corgis are Ready 4 Brexit!
anti	Macron and Co are risking recession in Europe just to teach Brexit Britain a lesson
pro	"Main Stream Media is cancer! And this headline ""How Britain lost Europe"" is deliberately confusing to people. The UK voted to LEAVE....we voted....understand?"
pro	Mainly because I feel that in order to ensure that we remain a relatively free society (UK free lol I know) we cannot continue to support a continent-wide government that will only continue to absorb more and more power from the member states.
pro	Mainly because I feel that in order to ensure that we remain a relatively free society (UK free lol I know) we cannot continue to support a continent-wide government that will only continue to absorb more and more power from the member states. The idea of federalisation is a leading light in the EU and it's a lot easier to put the boot down on a whole continent if you're governing the whole continent.

pro	Makes you wonder how the 92.2% of people worldwide not in the EU survive
anti	Making it more difficult and costly to trade is something that helps UK citizens/companies in general?
anti	Making two million people unemployed overnight is more likely to lead to social unrest.
anti	Man, I still don't understand this. But it sounds like no one really knows what will happen. Why don't they just draw on a big white board what is good about the EU and what is bad about being in the EU and start passing some laws to remove the bad pieces. Like if they don't like the free movement of goods and people from country to country put in a road block where you vet each immigrant. This law is like a local ordinance that supersedes how the EU does business. For example I live in a town in the US where it is illegal to sell alcohol or operate a bar. The town just doesn't want it. So when we want to go to a bar we drive over to Chicago 10 minutes away. At the end of the day don't worry about British company stocks soaring way down and Euro in a free fall down. These are actually good things and they are happening merely because of stock traders (legalized gambling) want to push it down. So why is it good: 1) Because the company is still a good company and now when you save you can buy more shares. You don't look at what it's doing you just save every month. And 2) the Euro going down means you are crazy competitive with the US, China, Japan, and every other non EU market. Every country wants to devalue it's currency. There is a gentlemen's agreement that no country will do this on purpose. But Japan and China are masters of it. And you guys go a huge devalue and you didn't do it on purpose. Finally don't believe the BS that you can never go back. Of course they will take you back, they never wanted to lose you. Just don't panic. Do what you do best everyday and it will be all good!
anti	"Many Brexiters are so thick they were unable to understand how it might affect the company they worked for. ""We don‚Äôt mind being a bit poorer if we get our sovereignty back"" - they didn‚Äôt translate that as ""you might lose your job""."
pro	Many Dutch people envy the Uk right now.
anti	Many Leavers have not yet twigged that it will be several months before Brexshit hits the fan.
anti	Many Remainers accept the advice in this article and easily see the opportunities afforded to the UK by leaving the EU. But we also know that the UK is not prepared to exploit these; and that is why we voted to remain. It is not from a woolly-minded vision of EUtopia that we voted, but a hard-headed assessment of how the UK‚Äôs weak educational system, protectionist instincts, and low-calibre leadership make it unfit to challenge the world alone. And that is without mentioning the issues we face on Scottish and NI independence, with Wales and English regions to follow. We are not flag wavers, but hard-headed pragmatists.
anti	Many UK workers will become second-class workers in the UK after brexit. Their colleagues with EU passports will be able to go work on a client's site in the EU without needing a work visa for each member state. From legal professionals and tourist guides to managers and software engineers, wages and careers will be far easier for those with an EU passport.How long will people put up with being second class citizens in their own country?
anti	Many companies high and low profile have left or will be leaving these shores because of #brexit. It's not just Nissan.¬†#brexit is damaging to most, if not all UK business.
anti	Many current UK firms have already either moved abroad or are making plans to do so. This is proof there is no such thing as a jobs first Brexit
anti	Many economists pointed out that Brexit prevented the UK tackling broader issues, such as chronic under-investment, poor productivity, fraying public services and ‚Äúdisgraceful‚Äù levels of deprivation.
anti	Many financial institutions, car manufacturers have left the UK already. Warehouses have been reallocated to mainland Europe. Keep on dreamin that you will be better off Britains.
anti	Many people hate the EU because they are jealous!
pro	Many people want borders again. Borders hold the promise of safety, security, and a sense of national unity.
pro	Many positive messages on here today. Looking forward to a bright future. A Brexit government puts us in the driving seat. #IndependenceDay
anti	"Many thanks to Dave ""the coward "" Cameron and Comrade Boris for National Stupid day tomorrow!"
anti	Many think the grass is going to be greener on the other side without knowing there's even going to be any grass on the other side
pro	Many who oppose the EU believe these institutions no longer serve a purpose. Not only that, these organizations take control away from individual nations. Mistrust and fear of losing control made Brexit a reasonable solution to them.
anti	Mark my words, there will be riots on the streets if Brexit goes ahead.
pro	Martin, I don't think it's true that the Conservatives are the party of Leave and Labour are the party of Remain ... both parties are split. This isn't a simple left right issue. I voted Leave and ever since I keep hearing that some sort of compromise is what we should have because it has what Leave voters wanted - sorry I voted to Leave not to compromise and all the Remain voters who tell me I'm a dick didn't vote for a compromise either. Let's face it no one voted for a compromise that doesn't have any of the possible benefits of Leave and doesn't have the benefits of Remain either. I believe in delay and a second vote because if our politicians cannot deliver Leave, and from the mess we seem to be heading for they don't, then I would vote to stay because at least we get the benefits of staying and not a deal with no benefits either way.
pro	Marvellous news - democracy at play
pro	Mass immigration was forced to destroy national identity, so all member states could integrate better. Their goal was to make the UK and France indistinguishable.
pro	Mass-immigration/migration does not concern you? Haven't you seen Sweden or Germany's current state?
pro	May and Corbyn met to discuss how they all going to be sacked at next GE for being useless instead of getting on with true Brexit
anti	May and the pro-Brexit idiots think England still has an empire and rules the seas......
anti	May be a second referendum now that everyone is well informed about the situation could make sense. If it is really your decision to leave it will be reconfirmed but if now people have understood the situation and will vote for remain in EU the politics should follow the will of the country. My question is : it is all this really worth?
pro	May desperately trying to scare us to submission with any horror story in order to keep her Euro buddies happy.
anti	May god have mercy on our souls.
pro	May is a traiter simple as.
pro	May isn't really interested in what the people want. She is blindly leading us on an unknown journey down a path to economic oblivion.
anti	May's deal means recession, Hard Brexit means depression
pro	May, you anti British traitor, you have had long enough to work it out and you have no intention of leaving. You're the worst and most loathed PM in all of British history.
anti	Maybe Brexit supporters (particularly the xenophobic ones) should be the new farm laborers. After all, don't xenophobes complain about foreigners taking jobs? Then why don't they work those precious jobs?
anti	Maybe French people don t like UK in the EU or they don t care. But I Do, I am Romanian , love UK, speak their language, learned their history, and I Would love to visit freely that country without a visa. Which I may not get, being Romanian, ‚Ä¶low class european. Let us be united, at least theoretically, because we know we re not equal, but at least we can travel if we afford it.

anti	"Maybe if we had just named the EU differently, something like the ""New Commonwealth"" or ""Even Greater Britain"", all of this nonsense could have been avoided."
pro	Maybe the EU can chlorinate itself and cleanse it of its own poison, before it swallows it.
anti	Maybe the UK should not have left the EU? We would have been spared all the crap since the referendum.
anti	Maybe the problem is that Johnson knows how many committed Europhobes there are in his party, knows their history of being willing to damage their own party to get their way, and being a lazy sod with no concern for the wellbeing of others or the good of the country finds it easier to say things that will keep them backing him than have them turn on him.
anti	"Maybe they're anti-Brexit because all the facts support that position. How about making an actual rebuttal to the facts presented? When Brexit is demonstratively a colossal failure are we supposed to ignore that for the sake of being ""ubiased""? That's not being unbiased, it's being a moron. There are no upsides to Brexit other than some sort of fucked up ""moral victory"" you feel you've accomplished. Congratulations, idiot."
anti	Maybe you shouldn't ask to get what you deserve. Iowans and trump voters and Brexiteers.

pro	Me I am A great Believer in the British People, and why not, do we not remember 2008? The Brits did what the Brits do got their heads down and dealt with it, didn't we just! Did we riot? no! Did we moan about getting ourselves in trouble and how it was every body else's fault? No! We got ourselves out of it. The British People are Great and out of the EU will make us GREATER Have pride and belief in yourselves. Vote Leave!
pro	Media hysteria! Brexit was a must. Any other result means no democrazy for British citizens. To many young know nothing about all the powers the Liberal Politicans has given away to EU since 1972. In EU you dont controll your own environment, not your own resources, and in the end not your own law and probably not your own police and military. And what do you have then? Yes a superstate where you have no say. No individual rights etc. It is astonishing that so many young people do not understand this!!!
pro	Members of the EU hierarchy are akin to those of the Labour Party. They refuse to acknowledge the real reason why the majority of Brits voted to leave. Prior to the campaigning for the 2016 referendum, most Brits were not bothered one way or another about our membership of the EU. Then we had project fear, the odious behaviour of Osborne, Carney and their cronies got us all thinking 'what are they trying to hide'? Then Cameron went to negotiate his concessions that were so meaningless that nobody understood what they meant - remember the 'emergency brake'? Post 2016 referendum, the behaviour of Juncker, Tusk & Co in publicly humiliating Theresa May, when she was in fact desperate to stay in the EU, irritated a lot of the British electorate. Their total unwillingness to enter into any realistic negotations stalled the whole process. More recently, the threats and the attempted bullying coming our way from the EU, made even the most moderate Brit glad that we are leaving this corrupt and hopelessly out of touch organisation.
pro	Membership costs ¬£350 million/annum. I believe it's a lot higher due to 'total cost of ownership' and lost opportunity

pro	Mistake? The only mistake was getting shackled to the bloated EU corpse.
pro	Mmm the Leftist Tears, how delicious. I'd rather have independence from a Union that hardly benefits the British people, and they have no say in what they want. This is the best thing that can happen, and I don't care what those Merchants do, they try to scare us into accepting the EU, I'll never accept the EU. The EU is a poison, and the left fails to see it.

anti	More Remain than Leave supporters who, for whatever reason, found voting too difficult, chose the easier option not to vote
pro	More contempt shown to the people by remainers makes Brexit that little bit sweeter. I've got a bottle of champagne chilling for the day Article 50 Is triggered planing on watching remoaners crying in the streets on the news as I sip it.
pro	More control over immigration: How dare those EU migrants come over willy-nilly and take our jobs and how dare they claim our benefits! And how dare the EU force us to accept this lying down! (sarcasm aside, this is actually a big problem for the economy especially given the migrant crisis where we are simply running out of resources and space to facilitate relocation on such a scale)
anti	More fantasy trade agreements from brexit clan... Look forward to losing thousands of jobs while this guy gets his deal smacked down.
pro	More irrational lies. The UK will trade with the single block as does every nation on earth, with a small, 4% tariff - worst case scenario. The EU is the cause for the rise of the right in Europe.
anti	More jobs, lower prices & safer streets: why we're #StrongerIn - vote REMAIN tomorrow to keep Britain strong
anti	More like trying to pray for a miracle to get us out of the stupidity of the Brexiteers.
anti	More likely because the people‚Äôs choice is stupid and founded on false information. This whole affair proved that direct democracy can backfire a lot

pro	More the reason not to let them fish in any of our waters
anti	Morning from Benares. To think that the Brits once ruled India. Today their demise is underscored by the fact that soon, when the Scots go, Britain itself will disappear. History tells us empires come and go. Indeed they do. #BrexitDay
anti	Morons! How can they make a deal without adhering to the rules? I‚Äôm sick of this imperial arrogance from our Government.
pro	Most Brits are annoyed and fed up with the bullying approach of the EU Commission and Chief Negotiator and leaders of other EU member states Britain has always seen as its closest allies. Had there been another referendum, the result would have been even more in favor of leaving the EU.
anti	Most bizarre act of national self-harm in recent recorded history.
anti	Most educated people wanted to remain in the EU, though.
pro	Most importantly: SJWs didn't want it. Their reason: Britain losing it's sovereignty is a payback for colonial days (I can't make this stuff up folks).
anti	Most likely the UK will seek readmission into the EU in around 30-40 years time bloodied, bruised and humiliated. but hopefully the English will be more capable of treating europeans as equals and have a better sense of their standing in the world.
anti	Most of the people that they polled in Britain admitted that they didn't even know what Brexit really entailed. The fact that Donald Trump thinks that Brexit is good business should tell you already about how dumb that decision was.
pro	"Most of the replies here seem to be ""Remain!"". I usually wouldn't bother with replying to a thread like this but I feel like the leave side needs at least something said for them. Wall of text on the way, TLDR down below. I want to leave, and on Thursday I will vote to leave. I am 20, middle class, live in central England. I am not a racist. I don't care about in-EU migration. My stance is that simply put I like Europe, I like the idea of a European state and given the chance I would vote for a federalised EU with its own defense force, welfare, head of state, common language (Even if it was French, or even German), taxation and all the trappings of a nation-state (provided there was adequate ""state"" governments for the various nations, not unlike the US system). But the EU as it stands now exists in a sort of political superstate (both a country and not, with and without a citizenry) where it passes laws without scrutiny or accountability. The correlation between the European election cycle and European law and policy is obscure in places and nonexistent in others. It both is and isn't a country with national interests. The interests of Brussels do not correlate with the interests of the European people. It has its own set of interests and they consist of Preserve the EUExpand the influence of the European GovernmentCoalesce the EU into a nation of some kind On their own these interests are innocuous at first glance. Of course it is in their interests to survive and thrive and I already said that I don't mind a Federated European Union on paper. But in practice these interests put them at odds with the national governments of member states. Without a real democratic mandate, the EU is only indirectly interested in the welfare of EU citizens. The interests above mean that the EU is incentivised to expand its sphere of influence into new countries instead of working with the countries it already includes. Instead of working with countries like (example) the UK it is in the EUs interest to bring more, potentially unsuitable countries into the European parliament so that it can edge out uncooperative nations on the debate floor. It is in the EU's interest to keep expanding rather as a means to achieve its goals, rather than simply to help its existing citizens. What's more, the actual laws that get passed in Brussels are often drafted by lobbyists. That doesn't happen in WASHINGTON. The degree of sanctioned, polite corruption and cronyism in Brussels beggars belief. The second largest lobbying industry in the world is in Brussels, only narrowly beaten by DC, and even in DC a lobbyist can't actually draft a bill. British politics suffer from a pretty extreme ""London Bubble"" and it's true that civil servants and politics have a revolving door between them and big business, but sanctioned lobbying is very difficult and severely limited in scope. I value that. It is true that most politicians are Etonian-Oxford wankers but if you want to run for office in Britain you do not need to do the ""fundraising"" money-for-favours it's-bribery-but-noone-cares bullshit so prevalent elsewhere, in DC and Brussels. Legality =/= morality and making bribery legal does not make it not bribery. So, it should be clear that the ""Federal European Union"" I envisaged above would involve a great deal of reform towards transparency, democratic legitimacy and a real mandate to its citizens. At this point I should say that I wish we didn't have this vote, and somebody else did. If another core member state had this kind of vote (France, Sweden, Germany, net contributors and economic cornerstones of Europe), I would be rubbing my hands with glee for months. At present we have a sort of dichotomy to face. If we vote to leave, then it legitimises Greece's longstanding wish to leave. And that is dangerous. The potential for a cascading route away from the EU would be the only thing that could really scare Brussels into real reform of the highest level of government. Us leaving alone, maybe not, but the threat of two or three countries leaving in quick succession would undermine the European market confidence and force Brussels to action. Long story short, if we vote to leave we may inadvertently create the kind of EU that I want to be a part of. But if we vote to stay, we will kill all chances of that ever happening. As many US citizens are painfully aware, even when everyone knows the system is crooked, if the only thing that can change the crooked system is the system itself, it will never change. Every US citizen knows Super-PACs and ""fundraisers"" are undemocratic legalised bribes. Most of them know the electoral college is a stupid system. Most every Brit knows that our first past the post elections where a party with 36.9% of the vote gets 51% of the seats and a party with 12.7% of the votes gets 0 seats are FUCKING BONKERS. But if it is up to the party that wins with just 36.9% to change the system, of course they aren't going to. Same for Brussels. Nothing will change without major external stimuli. But Britain leaving would damage the EU. We have the largest financial centre outside of the NYSE, more oil than the rest of the EU combined, huge reserves of shale gas, a world famous culture of higher education and research sector (Oxford and Cambridge are household names around the world, while Brunel, the LSE and others are well known leaders in their fields). We manufacture almost as much stuff as Germany, consume almost as much as Americans do, and are the EU's primary gateway into both the Commonwealth (includes such tiny insignificant places as Canada, India, Pakistan, Australia, and totals 17% world GDP) and the USA. Almost all transatlantic internet traffic goes through Britain. Transatlantic flights. Major shipping ports. Aircraft carriers and power projection capability. Nuclear Deterrent. The EU could survive us leaving, obviously, but it would feel us go. Britain is the fastest growing economy in the EU, and a significant net contributor to the EU project. So, I don't buy the ""we don't care, we didn't like you guys anyway"" and ""it hurts you more than it hurts us"" line that European institutions have taken in this debate. Many European economies are limping by at best, some exist on a knife edge. Those voices do have a role in this debate, but it should be conciliatory, not adversarial as it has been. I also do not trust the mainstream British media on the subject. My perspective is that the remain campaign has, instead of trying to have an intellectually honest discussion, made a deliberate effort to muddy the waters as much as possible. Their strategy has seemed to be ""make it as confusing and difficult as possible to form an informed opinion, stifle debate, the peasants don't know what they want"" because they don't trust the public with this kind of intellectual decision. A side effect of the ""London Bubble"" where those who walk in the corridors of power think the people of ""the North"" (ie. not London) are lazy morons and most of the British people grow to resent politics and politicians because they so obviously avoid having an honest dialogue when it doesn't suit them. It seems to me that the Remain campaign is more focused on confusing people, and bullying them (Osborne's punitive budget), because they know that scared people are more likely to vote for the status quo. The ""Most Economists"" ""This Economist!"" ""But That Economist!"" conversation seems like an exercise in this type of disinformation. It is reminiscent of KGB disinformation strategies. Instead of creating one big narrative that can be exposed, lie constantly, all the time, from different angles, say conflicting things, confuse people, and generally make it so that the average working guy who can only keep a passing eye on politics doesn't have the time to sift through to the truth. So he gives up and becomes disillusioned, and politicians get carte blanche. Sure the Leave campaign has run a pretty lowest common denominator fear-mongering campaign but the only way to cut through the noise is to have a clear, simple message you can put forth loudly. The leave campaign has also by and large steered clear of ad hominem attacks, name calling (""Racist!"" ""Bigot!"") and the relentless social signalling of the Remain campaign (""I'm so not racist, look how sorry I am for these people drowning!"") which always struck me as an intellectually dishonest way to try to win an argument without finding an answer. Ultimately I would have loved a more factually based, simple, clear set of debates where intellectuals from both sides got a national stage, but instead we have things like Michael Gove taking questions from a crowd. Slimy, dishonest people who see this as a proxy to advance their careers are leading the national debate on this, as are newspaper editors (almost always left, hyper-progressive social signal experts who are just as trapped in the bubble as the politicians). Where are the informed, calm, mediated debates from people who don't necessarily have an agenda other than finding the right answers (academics)? Nowhere. Even the BBC has failed to realise its normal format for shows like Question Time is unsuitable, and people shouting over each other is why we have this mess in the first place. TL;DR I'm voting out because I don't want to be a part of the EU in it's current form. I don't think the current EU system is fit for purpose as it progresses towards federalisation and it needs major reform. The only kind of stimulus that would instigate that reform begins with a ""Leave"" vote. I don't buy the scare mongering on either side, and I accept that in the short run Britain will suffer to exit. It will not destroy us. We are wealthy and well connected even without the EU. Meanwhile the EU is corrupt, and economically flagging. And Brussels has a very weak mandate to the people of Europe. Edit: Thanks for gold! 5x wow."
pro	Most people don't want to live in a united states of Europe. They want to live in a country called Britain.
pro	Most people just want to get out. According to a ComRes poll for ITN (with a massive pool of 26,000 people, far larger than for a normal poll), 54 per cent of respondents wanted Brexit delivered.
anti	"Most us ""doing OK"" voters have moved on from that position by now Gary. If the poor want to be poorer, let them follow Mogg over the precipice . They can/will blame who they want, like usual. They can wrap themselves in the Union Flag to keep warm, and eat platitudes for food."
pro	Most younger voters would not bother voting again, there would be no massive cash injection for a pro remain leaflet to every home in the UK, nearly all the horror predicted by project fear has been. proved completely baseless. With no government backing I would expect leave to get over 60% of the vote.

anti	My Leave voting mother just came in to see me, after seeing a Sky News piece on Japanese trade post. She said she had her ‚Äúeyes opened‚Äù by the sheer scale of the issues we might face outside the single market, and wondered how we could let other Leave voters know.
pro	My aim isn't to destroy the EU. I just want to get out. Staying in on the premise that we might (!) be able to destroy it from the inside would risk remaining in an empire that will become totalitarian and suppress dissent by force. And it will have a shiny new army to facilitate that.
anti	My argument is that want my friends to continue the lives they have built in the Uk or in EU and not be driven away by some disaster capitalists who want to earn a fortune by screwing the UK over
anti	My big worry is that a zero or rubbish deal next year will push most of the continent into recession (including us) and average Europeans (not politicians I mean) start blameing the Brits for the consequences. Europeans have been pretty benign about Brexit but that could change if they start losing their jobs or houses over it. Worried the worst relations could be yet to come
anti	"My biggest fear is we're risking committing economic suicide, based on a ""majority"" granted through a protest vote, some outright lies, an illegal campaign and some voter apathy."

anti	My dad‚Äôs from North Yorkshire and I‚Äôm a UK citizen (lived there for 8 years) so I‚Äôve been following it closely. It has been an overwhelming failure so far. It will, and has been, objectively detrimental to the British economy and state itself (with parties like the SNP gaining influence as a result). Farage is also a complete and total coward for resigning from UKIP the moment he got his wish, instead of taking the reins and steering the ship. That being said, however, him not being PM is probably a good thing. Theresa May was ineffective, but BoJo‚Äôs a complete mess. Won‚Äôt be surprised if Corbyn is the inevitable outcome. I wish the UK the best of luck with it (because it affects me too). I don‚Äôt want to see a No-Deal Brexit, but the options really do seem to be running out.
pro	My desire to leave the EU came from before the brexit vote was even being talked about. As I said, I wanted to be free of EU rules etc; there‚Äôs not enough of a benefit to being a member state for what we are putting in.
pro	My economics teacher is a remainer and calls all the brexiteers dumb because of the negative economic consequences of leave, but he's an idiot because people voted leave for social reasons.
pro	My english friends, leave E U this is the evil .the french will leave soon
pro	My eyes getting misty here. England you've fought so hard to take back your sovereignty from European Union. Some of you lost some friends or family members because of your support for Brexit, you want freedom in your OWN terms not dictated by EU. My brothers and sisters across the pond, England is worth fighting for. You are now in-charge of your own country, you are the one who will determine the future of England, country of the British people. I wish all of you the best, God bless you. LONG LIVE GREAT BRITAIN!! Wave UNION JACK with PRIDE!
anti	My family came from England 400 years ago and I worry that UK is going backwards, too many countries are going backwards...too much ultra nationalism and there will be more wars caused by silly small people...
pro	My fellow leave voters, today is our day. It's been 3 years 7 months of fighting and now our moment is finally here. Let get this party started. #BrexitDay
anti	My first response was panic. I‚Äôm a recent graduate, already facing financial instability, uncertainty in the job market, trying to work out my future. A leave result means more anxiety for me, more instability to navigate and try to understand. I‚Äôm also a woman of colour. From a young age, I‚Äôve been aware of racist and nationalist attitudes in Britain, spread around the country outside of my home and haven of London. I‚Äôve spent years watching people argue to dismantle the systems that allowed my mother and closest friends into the country to work, to lead better, productive lives. I‚Äôve seen people screaming that my immigrant family (biological and chosen) are worthless, that they contribute nothing. And I‚Äôve always felt unwanted, uncomfortable, underrepresented. This result confirms my fears. That my families aren‚Äôt seen as people, as human. They‚Äôre numbers, they‚Äôre a swarm, a threat. They‚Äôre not welcome here, and as a product of immigration, neither am I. With this result, England clings on to its colonial history, and I‚Äôm ashamed.
pro	My first votes didn't go wasted.I voted to leave.proud and happy.
anti	"My friend said if we vote to leave we'd be like ""a man who burned down his house because he didn't like the curtains"" Perfect."
anti	My greatest worry is that same UK will not allow other nations to leave a failed union like Nigeria
anti	My heart goes out to the British who voted to remain hopefully things will work out for your country in the end. From, an American who didn't vote for Trump.
anti	My honest opinion is that Brexit is a catastrophe of the first order, which has been driven by hate, ignorance and lies.
anti	My impression is, if it actually happens, it will cause the UK to break apart. I think it's a mistake and it wouldn't surprise me if the UK (or maybe just England &amp; Wales...) asks to rejoin the EU within 10-20 years.
pro	My joy is only matched by sad remainers heartache
anti	My life was really quite nice before Brexit.
anti	My mate just posted on his FB about him and his dad raising a flag to celebrate Brexit. ü§£ I mean...what is there to actually celebrate? Have I missed something?
anti	My mother in law lives in Spain. Please don't send her back here!
pro	My mum 90 next month has always been upset about the way Britain dropped the commonwealth. She's glad to see the back of the EU it was sold to her ,& all those who went through a war, as a peace/trading block when it was in fact always a plan to turn it into one country one law
anti	My neighbours go two or three times a year, they are that lucky. I don't think they realise how they will no longer be that lucky after Brexit.
anti	My new passport has arrived. It says European Union. It lasts for 10 years - and I intend to use it as a proud European Citizen for as long as I can.
pro	My opinion is it that it is an eye-opening experience on how stupid the average person is. There are people who vehemently defend the idea that our country should have laws and regulations created and enforced by un-elected foreigners. Why would literally anyone want that? It's literally anti-democracy. People who shill for the EU, what the fuck is your endgame?
anti	My opinion of Brexit has been unchanged since it happened: The UK shot itself in the foot with this move.
pro	My parents both voted Leave, they don't have any regrets
pro	My personal opinion is leave. The way i have seen immigration be an issue with places like germany and the likelihood of turkey becoming a part of the EU and the large influx of immigration that would cause would have a significant impact on the country. But that's a small reason i want to leave. the main reason is people in this country don't believe that we can be great they don't believe that we can stand on our own and i think taking the risk of leaving would strengthen everyones belief that we can be a great country once again who are significant in their own right and can stand alone without needing the backup of others
pro	My respect for the British grows every day, first and brexit vote that took back democracy and now the damming report against Tony Blair, God Bless Britain and may America learn to take it self back from you
pro	"My town has changed to an unrecognisable place in the past 10 years. The town centre is no long a pleasant place to go, full of rough looking eastern europeans. Crime has shot up, hospitals full of people that speak broken english. Old falling apart buildings which should be demolished or renovated are used to house run down ""romanian convenience stores"", ""halal store"". What has my once beautiful quiet town come to?"
anti	My view is that it's a huge, colossal mistake
pro	My vision for Britain's future was the Norway option - EFTA/EEA.
anti	My vote is going towards peace, prosperity and togetherness. Vote remain!
pro	My wife and I both voted BREXIT - for the sovereignty of our nation
pro	My word this is good. Our country has a great feel to it. Makes one proud to be British again.
anti	My worst nightmare has happened, as a country we voted out
anti	"NATIONALISM AND RELIGION WILL DESTROY THE SPECIES. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF STUPID NATIONALISM RIGHT HERE. lol in another 50-100 years they will join again and be like ""sorry our parents were FUCKEN STUPID"""
pro	NO !!! MOGG ... May is an EU Jesuit she will manipulate this also ... gives her and her EU comrades more time yet again to water down Brexit ... she needs to go and Brexiteer in number 10 !!!
anti	NO , Britain is one of the most important EU countries . Britain is very good for EU development . Really bad if Britain decide to exit EU .
anti	NO BREXIT!
pro	NO DEAL - LET US JUST GET AWAY!!!!!!
pro	NO DEAL - YES! None of our taxpayers money for the EU!
pro	NO DEAL BREXIT IS REAL BREXIT
pro	NO DEAL BREXIT is the only solution!
pro	NO DEAL Here WE COME
pro	NO DEAL IS BETTER THAN THERESA MAY'S BAD DEAL. I VOTED TO LEAVE THE EU - NOT STAY INSIDE IT
pro	NO DEAL IS BETTER THAN THERESA MAY'S BAD DEAL. I VOTED TO LEAVE THE EU - NOT STAY INSIDE IT.
pro	NO DEAL IS WHAT WE NEED - we'll cope
pro	NO DEAL NOW............ We can always negotiate a deal later after the dust has settled.
pro	NO DEAL!! we didn't vote to have compromises, more so when it's as clear as day May, and her remainer crew are desperate to keep us tied to the E U in anyway they can, the Irish backstop being a prime example
pro	NO Deal means the EU Unemploymnt figures are going to Sky Rocket. Britain has the highest emplyment in Europe. We can do much better than that when we are free to do trade deals with the other 95% of the rest of the World. The EU will whither and DIE.
pro	NO Deal please, out of the EU and its organisations that's what Cameron and the rest of them said, even if they now are trying to back track on it now the interviews and literature is out there showing their two faced views. I Voted for Leave, and in a democracy when you win the vote you expect that policy it to be implemented.
pro	NO NO NO, WE ARE OUT - Great deal for us or NO DEAL!!!!
pro	NO TO UNCONTROLLED IMMIGRATION VOTE LEAVE
pro	NO deal suits me.¬†¬† I hate the EU
pro	NO it was a simple choice that the elite did not accept so paid their news outlets to try to stop it At the risk of a Civil War
anti	NO, of course we are not ready, 17 million morons voted without having a clue what they were voting for with ZERO agreements in place. Turkeys voting for Christmas.
anti	NO. I say. Let's bin the rubbish that is Brexit.
anti	NOtHING will get better as a result of delivering Br exit. NOtHING!
anti	Nah, the UK ain't leaving. They're not THAT stupid.
pro	Nah, we're taking back control. That means spending the billions here on nurses etc The EU needs to learn that's there is something called consent. Ordering people around, running up massive pension debts and not telling people about them doesn't work.
anti	Nah,unlike the brexiters I'm not the one supporting doing stupid shit just because it's never been done before .
anti	Nailed it. Totally unacceptable for disaster capitalists to take over the country.
pro	Narsaccist, European expansionist, the European Union is worse than the Soviet Union.
pro	Nationalisation of industry, Hurting the Neoliberal EU, Higher taxes on corporations, Higher barriers to capital
anti	Nationalism is a sickness...Brexit is product of sick ignorant nationalism...
anti	Nationalism is a stupid, ignorant, simple idea for simple minded idiots. That's how Brexit and Trump came about. We need order back in Western Democracies. Order, long hard debate, and compromise to improve the lives of the people. Not dipshits like Boris/Trump and dumbshit ideas like Brexit and the Wall.
anti	Nationalism is the most contagious disease that makes clever nation into bunch of irrational fanatics.
anti	"Nationalist parties in Europe are on the rise at a frightening pace. The question is, ""Would this scenario of Europe swinging right generate a tsunami of forceful nationalism that may go extreme and become threatening?""."
anti	Nations and sovereign states have the right to decide what to do with their future. Leave the EU is as rightful for them as it is to leave the UK for Scotland. It‚Äôs not the solution though. It‚Äôs just one of the consequences of the horrible way the fat cats of Europe have been managing the union. Austerity policies and excess of nationalism are to blame.
anti	Nearly 50% of population who bothered to vote didn't want Brexit, and 2 countries within the UK voted to remain. Let's hope that sense will prevail and we remain.
pro	Need any more convincing. Out now before it's to late.
pro	Never darken our doorstep again EU. Rotten, socialist project that has failed.
anti	Never fear, Europe will protect the torch of civilization now that Britain has abandoned progress and slips back into darkness. Condolences to British Europeans trapped within the belly of the hard-right beast occupying power in the isles at this time. Condolences to Europeans of British origin living in Europe and to British-residing Europeans. Condolences to posterity and the generations that have now had their better futures stolen from them by these fascist monsters and on the basis of pure demagoguery and naked lies; illegitimately.
anti	Never gonna give EU UP
anti	Never had a blue passport and frankly, I‚Äôd rather be able to live and work in the EU, than have my passport be blue.
pro	Never heard you come out with that when we were having mass immigration imposed on us by the last Labour government.
anti	Never mind historians, none of us believe the sheer ignorance of Brexit supporters.
anti	Never mind the NHS Collapse granted
anti	Never really been able to comprehend the actual number of dumbfucks on this Island. Nor the extent of the actual dumbfuckery. Then I saw Parliament Sq on Friday night. People celebrating 'Getting Brexit Done' because that's what Boris said. There are fucking loads of idiots.
pro	Never see this kind of reaction to the American Independence Day on the 4th of July (Even though it wasn't actually 4th July). Come on, world. The 23rd of June was Britain's Independence Day!
anti	Never seen such ugly racist rhetoric in politics like this month. Don't let hate win and #VoteRemain tomorrow.
pro	Never should have. Joined. all that money wasted over the decades for little return and lose control of our identity.
anti	Never thought she was a Brexiteer, but given her intellectual level she must be
anti	Never, in our recent history have so few managed to brain wash so many with so little.
pro	New Dawn.....new beginnings, the future is bright....Rule Britannia!!!
pro	Next 5 years of prosperous trade and friendship between UK and US... Will be the inevitable capital sentence for the corrupt and senile EU
pro	Next time do as the elites say!
anti	Next week clocks go back one hour. Next March we go back 45 years.
anti	Next week, we'll be voting in the local elections. You may think it has nothing to do with #Brexit, but you'd be wrong. It will be a powerful indicator. Remainers must vote and they must vote for #proEU parties @LibDems #TheGreenParty. Please note: The Labour Party is #proBrexit.
pro	Next;Holland,Italy and then Greece.The German masterplan is over!
anti	Nice analogy except it wasn't an abusive relationship in any way. We prospered thanks to our membership.
anti	Nice one, Leavers. Cheers for that. Good decision you all made there. Top minds.
pro	Nice to hear some optimism for a change.
pro	Nice to wake up to a free country.
pro	Nigel America is with you...tell all the big-government elitist bureaucrats to stick it
anti	Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson are not persons with morals and conscience! Either 51st Trump US state or will continue to seek proximity to the EU ??? Either way, the British people will lose! Don't worry, as a convinced European I don't know if Europe will survive this, but I will fight for Europe and for the EU !! No winners, only losers!
pro	Nigel Farage never quit. Never never quit. Sounds similar to another British Hero. Well done. I wish better times for the good people of the UK. You deserve better times. God Bless the Queen.
anti	Nigel Farage said that he is for common market etc., but that they don't need European Court of Justice. Question then is: How would compliance with common market rules be enforced without a European Court of Justice? If a country stops treating others according to the rules, what remedy would there be? You need a court to rule on such disputes.
pro	Nigel Farage! Thanks! You‚Äôre my hero!
pro	Nigel Farage, Hero of the People of GB!
anti	Nigel can shove his flag into a whole that doesn't have much sunshine!¬†;-)¬†he is embarrassing out country and people. He doesn't represent me in this disrespectful manner.
pro	Nigel is the true hero of it all.
pro	Nigel won it fair and square over decades of hard works. Of course the remoaners will never ever appreciate that, they don't know hard works.
pro	No Audit in the EU for the last 9 years.........? 95% of contributions uncounted for ! let's get out before they steal anymore!
pro	No Brexit is worse than no-deal.
anti	No Brexit, get used to it.
anti	No Brexiteer has said it will be a success for over a year apart from obviously mongs on the internet - because everyone knows such statements will come back to hurt them real bad during the recession/depression.
anti	No Brexiter will be missing the EU, they're too busy feeling like a winner for the first and last time in their sad little lives.
anti	No Danish bread on the shelf....? Hope not a sign of things to come
pro	No Deal Brexit is the best deal for Britain as we can lead the world without fear ‚Äî but Project Fear still keep bombarding us with disaster
pro	No Deal Brexit is the way to go.. don‚Äôt listen to the scaremongers
pro	No Deal Brexit is the way to go.. don‚Äôt listen to the scaremongers.
pro	No Deal Brexit is what i want!!!!
pro	No Deal Is Brexit, Brexit is No Deal, everything else is a fake.
pro	No Deal Is what they voted for in the referendum .. We don't want to be in the European union or any other part of the so called club.. I agree entirely with the Yorkshire lads post.. They should start planting ..They have held their hands out long enough.. Never met a poor farmer yet.. Bring back industry and manufacturing to this country instead of giving contracts for shipping and steel to foreign companies.. let car manufacturers leave but not the tooling and machinery..that should cover the grants given to them..by this country.. I would gladly come out of retirement to train apprentices..and I believe many more tradesmen would do the same as long as they were willing to listen and learn.. For far too long government have relied on migrant workers to fill the gaps in our work force.. There is a true saying that you don't put all your eggs in one basket..This is precisely what governments have done for the last thirty years..for to long They have been relying on financial services to fund the country..
pro	No Deal is the only Brexit. Remainers making a deal on how we continue to bow down to the EU is not what the voters wanted, and before you say you wanted to stay im talking about the voters who won!
pro	No Deal is the only deal... Freedom from the tyranny of the EU..We don't need the EU
pro	No Deal is the only real Brexit; everything else is an elitist ploy to keep the UK tied as closely to the EU as possible.
pro	No Deal then . Good bye EU Au revoir , arrivederci ! get f.....
anti	No Deal, No Deal, No Deal..
pro	No Deal. Great opportunity to renew the UK economy that has been coasting along for years...time to do what what Russia is doing in farming, manufacturing...very successfully. Time to roll the sleeves up and engage with the world
pro	"No EU Legislation or being ""forced"" to accept EU laws that we mostly don't agree with anyway (unless we agree to remain part of the EEA or maintain a trade agreement, where a lot of legislation is a must). This means businesses have a better chance of growth as no legislation removes many barriers."
pro	"No I dont think we are divided in England.Every single region par London voted for Brexit. Every single one. Even labour voters lent their votes to boris in the ""red wall"". Because like me us English believe passionately in our country and a global Britain we back our fantastic country and will not play any part in a federal commuist state which it clearly is to anyone with an IQ above 50."
pro	No Madame! This is no mistake (Brexit) nor is it an error of judgement. This is called democracy and freedom and when those of the EU 27 remaining members get to see life outside of he EU, you‚Äôd do better to concern yourself over their departure too, rather than voice your panic in our direction... Bonjour!
anti	No brexit is the best deal!
anti	No brexit is the best deal!?
pro	No but I'm sorry you feel how you do. I voted for Brexit and I believe that in the long term we'll be better off.
anti	No but the point is the UK being worse off because of brexit is literally not an opinion, it is what is going to happen if we go through with this.
pro	No controlled leaving, a rock hard Brexit is the best example for the EU to show the members what happens when a member leaves.
anti	No country can be truly independent unless it deals with no one.Being in the EU isn‚Äôt that bad as things go.
pro	No deal
pro	No deal ! we will be fine in a few years time
anti	No deal = Good Deal for tourists. I'm hoping to visit the UK after the pound crashes. I'm guessing there should be a 9 month window before the riots start and the UK implodes like Greece
pro	No deal Brexit is fine. The UK doesn‚Äôt need deals with the EU. There are plenty of other countries to trade with. Plenty of other countries in the UK to do deals with.
pro	No deal Brexit is liberation and independence
pro	No deal Brexit is the best for UK.
pro	No deal Brexit is what the majority voted for
pro	No deal IS better than a negotiation - for Great Britain.
pro	No deal all the way!
pro	No deal any deal will be a bad deal I voted out and that's what we want not a remain deal and pretend were out lol
anti	No deal brexit wil teach British humility
pro	No deal has always been the deal. Idiots! That's what we voted for, leave means leave it doesn't mean make a deal and partly stay in.
pro	No deal is a clean brexit. Exactly what we voted for.
pro	No deal is better than any deal as thats what we voted for. Out means out !
pro	No deal is coming and a very good idea it is for U.K. Sovereignty
anti	No deal is coming. Hope you like poverty, brits.
pro	No deal is just a no deal with europe. With the rest of the world trading is done by UK rather than by the EU. The UK has its independence back = more power.
pro	No deal is the BEST deal.
pro	No deal is the best deal for the people..
pro	No deal is the best deal. Bollocks to Sky news , they are just EU sympathisers.
pro	No deal is the best deal. Media are just EU sympathisers.
pro	No deal is what the people voted for, just get on with it already.
anti	No deal or shit deal now? Woop woop.
pro	No deal sounds good to me
pro	No deal then. Simple.
pro	No deal! No 39¬£B ! March 29 Independence Day! Britain becomes Great again!
pro	No deal! We want out. The EU is a sinking ship.
pro	No deal, no compromise, no stalling get Brexit done should be the priority.
pro	No deal. Let's get the hell out
pro	No deal. No money. No want EU WANKERS.
pro	No deal. Out now! #Brexit
pro	No deal. Out. No more talking.
pro	No deals just leave. 1930's Germany looked a bit like the present eu, they have control of Europe and possibly May so wait for the stitch up. We DEMOCRATICALLY voted to leave, that word is not understood in the eu, but it is here. Local councils are planning for a no deal so they are expecting trouble on the streets. We voted leave, give us our wish or resign.
pro	No delay- we leave on time and take our money with us. The UK`s problem will soon become the EU`s problem.
pro	No explantion required thanks. We voted out
pro	No extension , just leave on the 29th the Eu is a sinking ship time we left.
pro	No flags rule? Sums up the eu
anti	No free trades for you man you crazy you pay to be EU member any idea how many jobs will be lose more and more brands leaves UK
pro	No it won't because we won't have to accept random unilateral EU directives written by unelected self-interested morons anymore.
pro	No it won‚Äôt, no party will ever win a parliamentary majority with a pro EU agenda. We never liked the EEC, we don‚Äôt like the EU & were going to hate the United States of Europe when it comes about.
pro	No longer have to bail out failing EU nations. Prop them up
anti	No mate. The UK needs to learn to be less complacent the EU owes it nothing. It will find out what trading outside EU is like. TPP scotched Commonwealth also 4 countries line up to veto UK's membership in WTO. The UK has thrived at other countries expense. Colonies especially. The sharks are out and there's blood in the water.
pro	No matter how much money George Soros pumps into the anti Brexit campaign, or how many tears are shed by the likes of Tony Bliar, There will not be a peoples vote. We've waited 40 years to get out of Europe. The remain campaign came out with so many lies, as did the unelected EU leaders. They laughed at Farage when he suggested the EU want a European Army. Now Macron has said in public, that he wants a European army.
anti	No matter the hardships or faceplants in the future, brexiteers will find other things to blame then brexit because admitting they were wrong would be admitting they are dumber then half the population.
anti	No matter what happens, Boris and his like will not have to suffer any consequences. Their wealth and privilege insulate them from any damage they cause. They neither know nor care how anyone else will be affected.
pro	No more EU holding us back... RULE BRITANNIA!
pro	No more bureaucracy
pro	No more concessions to the EU. Let's take back control.
anti	No more deal or no deal': Brexit language diktat for Foreign Office staff
pro	No more money being paid into a European parliament that isn't even understandable by most (more money for investing and paying off the deficit and not going into an opaque government structure that likes to spend lots of taxpayers money on ???).
pro	No more money from UK go to EU corrupted organisation ever again !!!!!!!bye
pro	No more paying out billions to the EU for exceeding our financial targets
pro	No more refugees!
pro	No more remoaners, we are out get over it
pro	No more stupid EU laws
pro	No more time needed. Arrogant EU don't want to budge then we walk away on 29th March with our ¬£39bn and use WTO rules.
anti	No no, the EU will hardly notice Brexit....hmmm we‚Äôll see!
pro	No one gives a shit about Europe and this will be reflected in the turnout.
pro	No one is losing access to the EU market, the young should have voted to leave if they ever want to own a house.
pro	No one knows what it will be like when we leave Europe as it's never happened before. I'm a leaver. I'm against the EU anyway as it's nothing like what we actually agreed to sign up to back in the 70s. Personally I think we will be fine. There are many other countries around the world that are fairly strong economies that aren't members of a wider community such as the EU. It's getting these idiots that want to remain as part of the EU to see this. As with the current situation with our government, they are trying to get as much money as they can, as being part of EU, bags them a other wage, and a larger pension compared to if we wasn't in EU. As for EU itself, they don't want us to leave, as we are 1 of probably 4 or 5 countries that are wealthy enough to support the EU, as all the other countries are far weaker, and getting constant handouts from those 4 maybe 5 wealthy countries. If we leave, that pressure will be on 3 or 4 countries. Basically it's all about money. We will be far better off without the EU telling us what we can and can't do.
anti	No one outside the DT echo chamber thinks Brexit will be a success.
pro	No one said Brexit would be smooth but I believe it will be better in the long term.
anti	No other benefit in Brexit can be identified at all.
anti	No other benefit in Brexit can be identified at all. I vote to remain EU.
anti	No plan, 27 vs 1, what a joke brexit is.
pro	No problem, the market forces will insist in a super nice free trade agreement between independent UK and the EU.
pro	No problem, the market forces will insist in a super nice free trade agreement between independent UK and the EU. And then all the others who leave can have the same agreement until there is no EU left and all nations are instead part of the new free trade block instead. There is ZERO need for a totalitarian and anti-democratic super state for the nations of Europe to have free trade with each other.
anti	No pros. Any positive effect like temporary rise in wages will be short term, followed by closing of businesses.
pro	No really. It wasn't economically viable for the UK to be robbed blind by (soon to collapse as everyone will leave) Europe.
pro	No regrets we're out. Well done GREAT BRITAIN. The EU is a rip off money pit.
pro	No regrets. I think the reaction proves that the elites were (and in many cases still are) taking the electorate for granted
pro	No second thoughts here!!!!!!! Fantastic day for great Britain
pro	No shortage of anti Brexit fake news in the media. Every single day we have a new hysterical scare story. It is actually quite pathetic. If you want to talk about economic crash let's talk about unsustainable government debts? Oh no let's talk about house prices instead which the government does nothing but disort with their every idiotic intervention
anti	No such thing as Getting Brexit done you twerp. Getting ready for mayhem when we crash out end of 2020 more like.
pro	No the best way to fight the EU is leave it ,and watch it destroy itself when everyone else leaves.
pro	No the problem is having a seat at the table the whole political class gets paid enormous sums of money there and its why most of UK political parties are pro EU so they can get a job there after their careers finish in the UK. Its a racket and not democratic.
anti	No think tank is independent Most are funded directly from the government in ‚Äòjob inquiries‚Äô
anti	No to Brexit. It‚Äôs a disaster for the UK.
pro	No translation error with me: Good riddance to the EU! EU‚Äôs last words to UK before Brexit were ‚Äògoodbye and good
anti	"No way am I ever going to fall in with Johnson's and Gove's demand to ""come together"" behind their Brexit project and move on into a glorious (isolationist or Atlanticist) future."
pro	No we not having second thoughts. We want out of the EUSSR
anti	No words express my sadness what happened to my beautiful Britain and its loving people, full of memories, friendships, living out a childhood fantasy. I am devastated, god bless you and us all.
anti	"No worries, you have Liam ""trade deal with the EU should be the one of the easiest in human history"" Fox on your side."
anti	No worrys.....there will be no brexit. The signs are all over.
anti	No, Britain is a strong European nation and we need everyone in the EU. There is power in unity!!!
pro	No, Poland intervened because it wants its people back in order to continue to build its economy. It is quite happy for us to be out soon.
pro	No, and EU should stop trying to stop democracy. EU is looking like tyranny
anti	No, because I believe in the free movement of goods and services.
anti	No, brexit is bad
anti	No, but if we do still decide to leave and trade with it... Our exports would still have to follow EU regulations. On top of that we won't be able to influence those regulations and we may also have to pay tariffs on goods we export. Furthermore, those with any knowledge of economics will also be concerned about contracts. EU businesses are less likely to invest in a country outside 1. the Eurozone and 2. the EU itself. If we leave foreign investment will likely dry up.
anti	No, it might have proven a good idea if we had done it on the down low after preparing for about 20 years and retooling the whole economy for more independent trade but we just decided to do this like yesterday with no preparation and made a huge song and dance about it
anti	No, it was an act of war on half the nation, land loss is that, always. We want to remain, we will remain. The referendum leave campaign was based on lies. Therefore you were not informed of the actual issues at stake. Therefore democracy was compromised. Therefore this PM should be in jail for subverting democracy, and the result annulled.
anti	No, it's your mess, leavers. You don't get to pass the buck like that.
anti	No, not the English ,please BUT ,THE ARABS,THE TURKS ,THE INDIANS ,THE PAKISTANS ,THE ROMA-INDIANS ,THE AFRICANS and all of the Asians ,AFRICANS and other NOT-EUROPEANS should leave Europe and go back to dwell in their own homenland and their own continents
pro	No, the EU is a complete mess right now and is only going to get worse... VOTE LEAVE!
pro	No, the EU sucks. We need no deal and we will prosper because we're British. Tories are great. March 29th is bank holiday.
anti	No, there are more risks leaving. Explain all the risks of staying.
anti	No, they should stay inside the Union, it‚Äôs part of Europe
pro	No, we left the EU so we can have an easier time to trade with countries outside the failing European Union. If you're going to speak about politics, please be informed about what you're commenting on.
anti	No, we're absolutely Fucked.
anti	No, we're absolutely Fucked. If we actually go through with 'Hard Brexit' (which is moderately likely at the moment) and there is no deal in March next year, you'll get to watch a pretty impressive political and economic experiment. The UK will become more detached from the global economy than almost everywhere except North Korea and Mauritania. It'll be brutal.
anti	No-deal Brexit / WTO tariffs paid by importers of UK exports: Beef 84% Cheese 57% Wheat 53% Butter 48% Lamb 48% Pork 30% Potatoes 11.5% Fish 9.6% Current EU membership tariffs: Beef 0% Cheese 0% Wheat 0% Butter 0% Lamb 0% Pork 0% Potatoes 0% Fish 0% Spot the problem.
pro	No-deal Brexit means you're no longer subservient to a govt of officials you didn't elect. It means taking back control of your own nation
anti	No-one will notice anything different. It was all a complete waste of time and money.
pro	No. And they won't have any say AT ALL in our legislation either.
anti	No. If it does it will be the biggest travesty of modern times in our country.
pro	No. No. No. No... We voted LEAVE. MP's should do what the people of the United Kingdom told you to do and stop thinking of what they personally want. The people put you in office.. and we can take you out.
pro	No. The overriding sense is that, at long last, the British people are in charge. It's a horrible thought for the Guardian, I acknowledge.
anti	Nobody can see what happens in the next 20 years but I say that the British people will regret their decision of leaving because they will have no voice over here anymore and are not part of important changes.
anti	Nobody cares about all this. The EU was going to abolish the tampon tax anyway. What matters is the availability and cost of goods on the shop shelves. My guess is the costs will in general rise after Brexit.
anti	Nobody denies that a hard brexit will cause a lot of suffering.
pro	Nobody else would have the guts. Go on Theresa
anti	Nobody really felt any of the actual effects of it, because we hadn‚Äôt yet had to look at border checks, we hadn‚Äôt had to consider what happens to our right to live, work, study and love in another country.‚Äù
anti	"Nobody tell the Brexiteers that we have 11 months of being absolute rule-takers with no say in said rules before they're able to fully celebrate their ""victory"""
pro	Nobody voted for a poxy deal. We vote to LEAVE THE EU, all of it, like we were told would happen.
anti	Nobody voted for this. Brexit is turning into a national disaster. And 56% and growing now want to #Remain. Write to your MP to demand they #RevokeA50 and #StopBrexit.
pro	Non EU immigrants support Brexit because they believe in democracy instead of totalitarianism which EU is sponsoring.
pro	Non aggressive nationalism is a plus for most. Globalism is a quicksand swamp for 99% of individuals. The other 1% are cornering all riches.
pro	Non skilled Europeans are already in their thousands in the UK. More have left the UK after grabbing a UK Social security number & are happily claiming child benefits, unemployment benefits & Incapacity allowance from UK taxpayers while living in EU. Leaches & parasites.
anti	None of this drama would have been necessary if we had Remained. The Brexiters are drama queens. Anything for a bit of high theatre including especially the disruption of millions of people's ordinary lives. For nothing. Sovereignty my aunt Jemima!
anti	Nonsense!! The British came all the way from Europe to west Africa and for the sole purpose of what they would gain from Nigeria, they amalgamated this useless country called Nigeria and since then we have never known peace and there is so much hate amongst the northern, southern and eastern people of this 'jungle' and now you want to break away from EU. Do you think you will know peace? I don't think so.
anti	Noo stay i want to stay in eu
anti	Noone mentions the value-loss of the pound in this after Brexit. It drains money out of the economy because speculative bussiness is using the turmoil to gain money by exchanging between currencies.
anti	Noooo! Come back!
pro	Nope, brexit will be the best thing we have achieved since winning world war 2
pro	Nope, brexit will be the best thing we have achieved since winning world war 2.
pro	Nope, not changed my mind. Brexit please...
anti	Nope. YOU voted to leave. I didn't.
anti	Norway has oil and is OK on its own.¬† The Swiss look after everyone else's money --ill-gotten or not.¬† ¬†So far the EU is fairly content to remain together.¬† ¬†The Brits problem is and always has¬† been the fact that they want to rule rather than cooperate.¬† ¬†They just want to have an empire again.¬† Their economy is in shitty shape due to the austerity applied in 08 and they think they can go it alone?
pro	Norway, Switzerland, Iceland are all not in the EU, all doing fine
pro	Norway, Switzerland, Iceland...all not in the EU, all doing fine......
anti	Not EU's fault.
anti	Not a British citizen, but I am living in Britain, and I am terrified of the prospect that the UK might vote to leave.
anti	Not a good start, Boris
anti	Not a single job lost Jeremy? Yesterday, another 900 jobs lost due to Brexit. And still, Corbyn refuses to lift a finger to stop this shambles.
anti	Not a single reason for Brexit that makes any sense.
pro	Not a surprise is it? We voted to Leave, and we are leaving all the EU systems and institutions.
pro	Not about imagrants it's about a second government in Brussels dictating to us and making out it's democracy.
pro	Not about the economy it's about our culture our way of life and is being destroyed we are becoming less British
anti	Not all of us want to leave.
pro	Not all people who voted out are old,young people voted out,so just get a move on And get us out.No more talk of a second referendum,17.4 mil voted out so do it,May grow a bloody back bone.
anti	Not at all. Just cancel Brexit and be done with it. We'll all sleep easier knowing there will be food on the shelves.
anti	Not being funny but a sandwich at my college normally cost ¬£3 now it's going to be ¬£5 bloody hell
pro	Not complaining so much as EU stance proving exactly the point why they voted Leave.
anti	Not even a hard brexit can cure a hardcore brexiteer.
pro	Not even photoshop, i took a picture of my flag and it came out like this.happy brexit day
anti	Not good this brexit....I can only see there being less monies in the United kingdom....in the not to distant future...bad idea if you ask me....Chris McMahon Inc .
pro	Not happy with the transition period as it is. Any deal we make with another country has to be approved by the EU, not happy with that at all. Just leave, sure its a bumpy ride at first but we will be better off in the long run.
pro	Not interested in any deal with Europe. Can't trust them. Or our own mps. Out no deal. Any body wants to be in Europe. move there. so true brits with backbone .Can run there own country. Like our grandfather's fought for.
pro	Not just Europe! From Frau Merkel's latest speech she is evidently wanting world domination.
anti	Not just economically. Britain is diminished in every way by Brexit. There are simply no benefits unless you are a rascist, a disaster capitalist or tax avoiding billionaire
anti	Not just the car industry but the knock on effect on associated industries like 3D modelling and other IT industries will be catastrophic. And yet the Brexiteers said IT based service industries will grow exponentially post-Brexit
pro	Not just the imagination its the lack of handling and now the terror attacks.. we dont want to be in tbe E.U #EliteUnion is what E.U means they want to control you more and more. Bring a civil war and see who defends them against the world.. All Races should United and Disable these Old men playing war games!
anti	Not mentioned is environment. I fear for conservation funding and environmental legislation with Brexit.
pro	Not my Parliament.HAPPY BREXIT DAY
pro	Not one single person has any clue what remain means. Not one single person can say what would be the remain position.?
pro	Not only don't pay a penny, stop all benefit payments to all EU migrants working in the UK on 31 March as well. Watch the rats run: plenty of employment, housing and no NHS waiting lists from then on in...
anti	Not only should it be delayed, it should be re-examined. What is worse, a step back from leaving the EU or a second referendum and cries of democracy having failed, or an economy that shrinks dramatically with all the dire consequences this will bring? I know which one I would prefer.
pro	Not only the greatest moment in the history of Britain, could be the greatest moment in the history of the world as well
anti	Not paying member fee has to have consequences (the EU is not the BBC). So - the deal the UK can get from the EU will be worse by that amount relative to what the UK had while a member.
pro	Not quite right. Wealthy will receive zero impact to their level of life. It's middle class and poor who will get it worst. Middle class will loose standard of life, many of the poor will loose social support due to the poorer country's budgeting.
anti	Not really surprising for May wanting to basically keep all benefits from the EU while ditching all obligations at the same point
anti	Not remotely possible for me to ever come together with you. Brexit has made me so miserable. You are responsible for a great amount of sadness, anger and confusion in this country.
anti	Not the end of the world but almost
anti	Not to late to cancel Brexit and remain in the EU
anti	Nothing about the referendum has made me quite as angry as Welsh people wanting to leave the EU.
pro	Nothing about what‚Äôs happening in Italy in this paper, yet. How will Remainers spin the Euro dictatorship the rest of us can see?
anti	Nothing but lies from the fascist right as usual.
anti	Nothing good will come of Brexit, for the UK.
anti	Nothing happy about this day whatsoever
pro	Nothing more beautiful than a bunch of socialists crying the end of a failed project
pro	Nothing the Nazi EU does surprises me the bastards that is why I voted to leave to get away from these leeches.
anti	Nothing to celebrate...only fear and regret.
pro	Nothing will change ,Except we will thrive and stop paying into something that has whittled us away for 45 years .
anti	Nothing will come from brexit, apart from job losses, its all bs
anti	Notice how people that voted to leave were all old and will probably die before it comes into effect.
pro	Notice how the BBC didn't show Nigel's speech, they just showed him being scolded and then whatever that Irish woman was saying. He hasn't destroyed Europe as she said, what is she even talking about? Just spewing more EU crap. And that Nichola Sturgeon is a trouble maker, just like Corbyn.
pro	Notice how these rich people never get poorer but keep telling you it's brexits fault. Nothing to do with millions of unskilled from the eu coming here and getting housing benefit tax credits and public services having paid minimal tax.
pro	Notice nobody laughs at Farage as much anymore?
anti	Now Boris Johnson is PM... Oh Boy
anti	Now Brexiteers are going to keep bombarding the public with propositions that are not possible to keep up the blame on the EU for not being able to accept, always framing it as the EU being unreasonable towards unicorns.
anti	Now Britons will need visa to get into the European countries, as an aftermath.
pro	Now I wished Scotland left, they be happier and be safer at this point
anti	Now UK can trade freely... YEAH!!!! Then you forget that WTO trade tariff is based on what the country individually prefer and you need to obey them in order to reach an agreement since you're no longer can use EU tariff anymore... LOL. I think UK make a big mistake prefering Brexit seriously.
anti	Now UK has no one else to blame :-)
anti	Now asking UK companies to beg the EU for mercy. That Brexit's going great, eh?
pro	Now begins the struggle to return sovereignty to the UK. There are plenty in the establishment that will try to undermine the victory of democracy.
anti	Now get ready for the consequences. France former president DeGaule was right to oppose UK adherence to European Union.
pro	Now i can sleep easy because i know all of this is really going to help me out somehow
pro	Now its our time, our land, our choice, Brussels rules gone forever.
anti	Now it‚Äôs not the time to campaign to rejoin. But we must keep dream alive, especially for young people who are pro-Europe. I hold in my heart the knowledge that I'll be back in this chamber celebrating our return to üíö of Europe.
pro	Now it‚Äôs time to bring back manufacturing to Great Britain, instead of outsourcing to the EU.
pro	Now just work hard and hard enough to prove that brexit is only the right option!!!!
pro	Now leaders can Make Britain Great Again without the EU sucking Britons dry, flooding their cities with terrorists masquerading as refugees.
pro	Now let's get a good deal, UK an Island, a trade agreement with EU, make our own rules
pro	Now let‚Äôs use this opportunity to integrate with the wider world in trade and cooperation... and NOT use it as a Tory wet dream to rouse nationalistic-imperialist sentiment in the minds of the populac
pro	Now let‚Äôs use this opportunity to integrate with the wider world in trade and cooperation... and NOT use it as a Tory wet dream to rouse nationalistic-imperialist sentiment in the minds of the populace
pro	Now our economy will no longer be dragged down by Greece's
anti	Now please let us leave the UK we dont wanna be there we didn't wanna leave the EU and we want our lands back and a future for out children üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åøüè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø
anti	Now seeing this. i see how many stupid people the UK haves. dont know anything and there are only old people talking. bye UK good luck you will lose a lot
pro	"Now that Brexit has happened and is reality it's time to realise that it's up to everybody to make success of it. Why do you expect leavers to do all the work while you sit and be a dead weight yourself? Brexiteers did not say for 47 years ""well, remainers, it's all up to you, we remain so you prove us it is worth it"" so why would you?"
pro	"Now that Trump is going to be the president, I believe that Brexit will end up being totally justified, because a US/UK trade deal is going to be ""bigly"". The UK, being able to negotiate with the U.S. on equal footing, and without the myriad of unelected bureaucrats in Brussels creating massive roadblocks and regulation, will end up being a economic boon for both countries."
anti	Now that opinion polls have shifted massively in favour of REMAIN, BREXIT must be halted in its entirety by all means necessary!
anti	Now that the Polish workers are being barred, are you Brits ready to take their job as plumber or clean building windows?
anti	Now that the ‚ÄúBrexiteers / Leavers‚Äù have ‚Äúwon‚Äù they are very angry. As things get progressively worse in the U.K. they will get angrier. There is no good reason to Brexit.
pro	Now the UK won't be a Muslim state, good job!
pro	Now we have chance to engage with the modern world, unfettered by the EU's silly tarrifs and mass of regulations - mostly in place due to systemic corruption at Brussels.
anti	Now we just sit back and wait before UK realises they cannot cope alone and on their own and will try to return to cooperation with Europe in one form or another
pro	Now we need someone to lead a movement to end mass immigration.
anti	Now, I am still not fully up for Britain leaving the European Union - there are still a huge amount of advantages of staying in.
anti	Now, more than ever is not the time to withdraw from our neighbours. The consequences, particularly for those least able to withstand them will be undoubtedly negative. Don't let the likes of Johnson, Gove and the vile Farage persuade you otherwise. Our membership of the EU is something to be proud of, we can't turn the clock back and the future of the UK is far better served by remaining in. Voting leave will undoubtedly unleash forces and attitudes that have no place in a civilised society, one of the prime reasons for the formation of the EU in the first place.
anti	OMG this is hilarious. The UK will have no choice but to pay. You made your bed now lie in it.
anti	OMG! We (the UK) are so f**ked now....
pro	ONE of Britain's foremost pensions experts has warned that remaining in the EU will be catastrophic for both state and private pensions in the UK. Why are the remainiacs not putting this little gem out to the voting public. vote leave.
pro	ONLY Jacob understands politics. He's the only brain here AND he cares about PEOPLE way more than the Left do.
pro	OOOOOOOOOOO!!! WE DID IT!!! BREXIT ALL THE WAY!!! WOOOOOOOOOO!!!...
anti	OR YOU COULD, YOU KNOW, JUST NOT BREXIT. THAT'S AN OPTION, TOO.
pro	OUR SOVEREIGNTY IS NOT FOR SALE! Why can't the bremainers understand this? It's bad enough that Westminster is out of touch with the people, the eurocrats at Brussels would be even more so and we won't be able to remove them from power! So there really is only one sensible choice in this referendum and that's to leave!
pro	OUR government CAN NOT CONTROL ANYTHING as we are CONTROLED FROM THE EU on all matters ,if and a big if we stay in ,within the next 20-30 years THE EU will have abolished ALL governments of all member states THEY ARE HELL BENT ON FULL CONTROL of everyone within the EU ,that wont worry me one bit as i will be dead,but for the last few years of my life ,i would really like for the UK TO BE FREE FROM their CONTROL VOTE ALONG WITH ME and VOTE OUT
pro	OUT !!!!
pro	OUT ,i find it an insult to be part of europe ,i am BRITISH NOT EUROPEAN
pro	OUT IS OUT.....WHATS THE PROBLEM.. YES WE VOTED OUT
pro	OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT... BUT THE NWO IS IN FULL EFFECT, SCARE MONGERING AND EVERYTHING.
pro	OUT OUT OUT! We must protect our country, culture and identity. Think about the British people of the future.
pro	OUT OUT OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
pro	OUT, OUT, OUT. And of course leave the EU as well!!!
pro	OUTSTANDING! Another direct hit to the global socialists
pro	OUTSTANDING! Another direct hit to the global socialists.
anti	OWNED BY CHINA!!!! BWUUUUAAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! Good luck Oliver Twist!
anti	Obama is a very wise man & I'd certainly follow his advice to vote to REMAIN IN the EU. Most of the politicians who want to leave are proven two faced liars.
pro	Obama should keep his nose out of our affairs. His arrogance is breathtaking. Seeing our leader grinning like an idiot while he threatened us made me, for the first time in my life, feel ashamed to be British. Vote Leave to regain our self respect!
pro	Obvious remain propaganda is obvious remain propaganda.
anti	Obviously the British people did not vote for what's happening now. They were given a ton load of misleading information and the Russians got in the muddle. Why is no one talking about a new vote? Seems to be their only way to get out of this.
anti	Obviously though we are all sad to lose our British friends. Increasingly though it seems that while we want the UK that was to stay we are uncertain about the UK that is. Tbh this seems more an internal reckoning that got out of hand than something to do with the EU
anti	Of all bad ideas ‚ÄòGreat Britain‚Äô has had, leaving the EU is the biggest, by far!
anti	"Of all the be careful what you wish for examples, ""Brexit"" is right there at the top of the list. Ok, maybe second, after ""President Trump""."
anti	Of course Brexit means that something is wrong in Europe. But Brexit means also that something was wrong in Britain.
pro	Of course Tusk is calling for Brexit to be cancelled. He still wants our money and as the EU have proven time and again they have no concern for what people actually want as long as the cash keeps rolling in
anti	Of course brexit will be a success...for its wealthy hedge fund backers.
pro	Of course the EU want to keep the U.K. in the Customs Union, they still want our money. When will our Government wake up and just walk. We could have saved 2 years waste of effort.
pro	Of course the big businesses want to stay in EU.
pro	Of course the big businesses want to stay in EU.they have done very well for their directors and shareholders.ordinary workers have seen their wages stagnate while the cost of living has skyrocketed.it is no good politicians quoting statistics and percentages we want to see a true rise in ordinary people's standard of living.
pro	Of course they are protesting. Millions of foreigners are living and working in Uk freely because of E.U. treated. Once Brexit goes through, Millions of those people will have to go back to their country of origin
pro	Of course we should the EU is more corrupt than FIFA.The EU after 20 years have still not had their accounts signed off.
anti	Of course we want you to stay! Brexit is a tragedy for Europe as a whole. Please stay!
anti	Of course we won`t starve but I bet that in less than 40 years time we will want to rejoin the EU.
pro	Of course, Germany companies have been moving their factories out of the EU for Years to non EU countries to avoid the high German taxes and EU meddling in their regulatory affairs. We MUST remove UK Plc from the influence of the EU to safeguard our interests tpp.
pro	Off we go, and no remoaners - I don't mean your imaginary cliff.
anti	Officially #Brexit day. And nothing, nothing is securely planned for our future, but 130bn has been spent. Unbelievable.
anti	Officially the end of UK at 11pm, nothing much really to celebrate about
anti	Oh I can't wait for all those lovely trade deals. Of course, we are in such a strong position to negotiate
pro	Oh another piece of Hollywood corporations telling us feeble minded people that we were tricked and or duped into doing something we don't want to! How will I ever know anything if not for these Hollywood corporations, thanks for looking after me.
anti	Oh boy, I cannot wait until we‚Äôre back in the EU after 20 years
anti	Oh boy. This comment section shows why it's a gift for the EU that the UK leaves it. They have never understood the idea of a united Europe. They don't want to be equal, they want to be special
anti	Oh dear - in less than 11 months, you will be definitely losing access to 168 trade agreements and over 40 free trade deals, regardless of what happens with the EU - UK trade agreement. Even if you get it, you can wave goodbye to the above. There are over 6000 different agreements that exist between the EU and other countries governing flights, auto/insurance and driving license acceptances, medicine and so on. Good luck trying to replicate this before the country crumbles. Enjoy the moment Brexiters, it won‚Äôt last long - and don‚Äôt forget: you will be reminded every step of the way that it is YOUR responsibility.
pro	Oh dear EU it seems companies are more likely to desert the EU than Britain.
pro	Oh dear. More anti Brexit propaganda. Did the EU pay for this? It‚Äôs clearly telling the audience that the only reason Britain voted to leave was because of an evil mastermind tricking people into doing so.
pro	Oh dear. The EU have just lost a country with the equivalent of 18 of their economies.
pro	Oh do give it a rest ! Just pack up and sod off to live on mainland Europe if you think the EU is so bloody great.
anti	Oh don't fucking start. You got your bollocks Brexit. Enjoy it while you can before you start whingeing about Scexit
anti	Oh for god‚Äôs sake: if Deutsche is Lehman, then the U.K. will have issues just like it did after, yes, Lehman, a company based in the USA, not the EU!!! So it‚Äôs got nothing to do with the EU! And ‚Äúdemographic problem thanks to feminism‚Äù?!? I can see where leavers want to take women, back to the kitchen, barefoot and pregnant!
anti	Oh for goodness sake. As if Nigel Garage (as I like to call him) hasn‚Äôt humiliated us enough.
anti	Oh goody. Another day facing the consequences of the result of a vote on the all-too-real future having been dictated by nostalgia for a non-existent past.
anti	Oh it's all going so well! Brexiteers still won't accept any responsibility for this shit storm we are in.
pro	Oh joy of joys were out of that undemocratic fascist deceiving organization known as the eu
anti	Oh look no one answered that question, typical Brexiters
anti	Oh lord, Brexit is the biggest political shitshow in history
anti	Oh my god, what a shame, Brexit won, the world is coming to an end.
pro	"Oh she meant it all right. We mean it too, the only difference between us is that it is the EU who will need ""luck""."
pro	Oh the euphoria.
anti	Oh the irony, pensioners deciding the future of the millennials.
pro	Oh this looks unbiased and fair.... People voted leave overwhelmingly because the EU have no sovereign democratic right to make law over UK citizens
anti	Oh well more Brexiter lies.
anti	Oh well more terrorist attacks to come, Lord Rothchild Jacob can't be to happy aye
anti	Oh well, being a first world country was good while it lasted.Hopefully the ghost of Charles de Gaulle will let us back in in a few months when everything sucks again.
anti	Oh well. Once Brexit is done, every briton will become a millionaire. Isn't that right, Mr Farage?
anti	Oh yeah, just what the UK needs, US-style health insurance with its high rates.
pro	Oh yeah. Simply because you don't like the outcome of a referendum, don't do the will of the people. Do a terrible job negotiating and the throw your hands up and have do over. I wonder how many pushing this decidedly anti-democratic path would feel the same if the remainers had won??
anti	Oh yes? We're coming to get you. You have NO conception of what you've unleashed.
pro	"Oh! Dear! One less ""Project Fear"" Remainers can't use. Do you really expect very much to change after Brexit? Do you really expect things to change much even after a hard Brexit? They need us. We don't need them."
anti	Oh, like you know him. It‚Äôs Buik not Buick. Typical leaver, never gets his facts straight and pretends to know more than he does while accusing everyone else who disagrees with him of manufacturing lies.
anti	Ok great i can't wait when Ireland an Scotland will make a divorce and split from UK
pro	Ok remainders, it‚Äôs you we are sick of listening too, you moan moan moan, democracy no longer seems to work In this country, pathetic liberals constantly crying because a democratic vote did not go there way.
pro	Ok so having control of our fishing etc in our waters. Why should our fishing communities be told they are at quota levels but other Eu nations can fish. Surely our priority is to feed our own.
pro	Ok, got Brexit done. Soon we take back control!
anti	Ok, it's been 2 days and I still think #Brexit is rubbish.
anti	Ok, it's been 2 days and I still think brexit is rubbish. Sorry.
pro	Ok, lets debunk the fear lies; moving goods from or to the UK wont be a huge issue, not to buyers and sellers with a brain, companies are not going to want to shoot themselves in the foot to punish Britain, they still want to sell their good stuff and their rubbish to UK customers and still want to trade with good UK traders, like they do with other countries outside of the EU.Britain will make deals with other markets which will now be easier and cheaper.Britain and the EU have just over two years to sort it out, the changes are not happening next week.If people loose jobs or the mortgage goes up, that's a result of the lies of fear the Remain camp and the media were spreading; see the world didn't end.The UK was never really protected in any way by the EU, if Russia invaded the EU would do nothing, we are protected by Nato, which has nothing to do with the EU.Laws can be made or changed to ease the changes, if the ones in charge care to do so.SO STOP PANICING AND SPREADING LIES OF FEAR.
anti	Ok, so we need to destroy the country to get rid of UKIP. I would prefer giving them dozens of seats at Westminster, they are useless anyway
pro	Ok. Perfect. Now LEAVE! Europe had enough of your theatrical attitude. Good bye!
anti	Okay I'm not even British but just the thought of something like that happening to a country terrifies me. Yes it had it's pros but the cons outweigh it. At least from what I've seen and heard. Please correct me if I'm wrong because I am no expert but still, doesn't seem like the best idea.
anti	Old people and idiots have screwed the uk.
anti	Old people have taken away our right to live and work freely in the EU because they felt a bit patriotic. I don't recall millennial doing anything like that.
anti	Old people voted to leave. Young people voted to stay. Who's future is it though...
anti	Old stubborn UK people destroying the future for their next generations.
anti	Old, uneducated and unemployed are for brexit
pro	Omg how exciting. Britain taking back its country. An historical moment and I'm excited to be part of it. X
pro	On 25th May 1961 President Kennedy said they would enter a programme to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade. It took just 8 years with the limited technology available at that time. Obama talks about a trade deal with the UK taking more than that time, absolute piffle . What this means is that the US are now so sluggish that other nations will overtake them as the worlds powerful economic nation, if not already, eg China, India and perhaps one day the UK. Vote leave on 23rd June.
pro	On 31th of January, at 11pm, after 30 years of resistance, the great people of Britain had finally got Brexit done ! Our proud nation finally left the eussr ‚Äôsuperstate‚Äô...
pro	On farmers. Since the UK is not self sufficient then it follows that farmers will have an excellent market. Carbon footprints would be reduced to.
pro	On the ballot paper there should only be leave options.¬† The country has already voted to leave.
anti	On the basis of all the evidence, I‚Äôd say Brexit isn‚Äôt working.
anti	On the contrary, poll after poll shows the people who voted to leave now regret their decision
anti	"On the other hand they are stating that the only reason for remaining is ""economic risks""... They are not considering political and military fields, or simply the freedom to move to any European country at any time. I wouldn't say that it isn't neutral, it is just very simplified"
anti	On the other hand, the Leave camp claim that energy bills will go down on Brexit - but that can only happen if the UK scraps its own rigorous Climate Change Act, which the government says it won't do.
anti	On the two-year anniversary of the EU referendum, tens of thousands people took to the streets of London, UK, on Saturday to protest Brexit, demanding that the public have a say on the final Brexit deal.
pro	On the whole we Brits love Europe we just don‚Äôt like the EU or teh way we have been boiled like a frog to invoke the long term ‚Äòhidden‚Äô plan and undemocratic process to morph the common market into the United States of Europe.
pro	Once again the liberals refuse to obey the will of the people.
anti	Once again, people are blaming the EU for the behaviour of greedy bankers. Let's not mix everything up, please! This old ongoing Germanophobia popular in England is really pathetic. Instead of doing well, some in England prefer to blame others for their misfortune. Start by throwing out all those third world migrants for a start (no, that's not the EU's fault, it's political correctness that is at fault). So, once again, the EU is not the problem, the greedy corporations are the problem.
anti	Once the welfare state is dismantled then no more sponging foreigners will come in, that totally makes starving in a ditch unable to afford basic healthcare totally worth it right?
anti	Once their economy collapses. I look forward to buying cheap british property
anti	Once their money is safe in unregulated tax havens they will never give another toss what happens to the country and/or anyone in it except them.
pro	Once they see how Much more successful the UK is outside - they will be lining up to leave. The EU know it
pro	Once we have left, we can stay as close to the EU as is convenient to us. Not how convenient it is for the EU.
pro	Once we‚Äôve left the EU, we will be sovereign and free (whatever that means). Our skilled negotiators (led by dead-beats such as Liz Truss) will strike a free-trade deal with Japan, something the Brussels bureaucrats could never pull off.
anti	One benefit of brexit is that lots of manufacturing workers are going to have a LOT more freetime. Around 100% more.....
anti	One hundred years from now in history lessons the definition of Brexit will be summarised by ‚Äúno one knew fuck all at any point ‚Äú
pro	One last chance for Britain to regain national sovereignty. Time to ditch the euro commies
pro	One last chance for Britain to regain national sovereignty. Time to ditch the euro commies.
pro	One mans reason for voting leave was because he couldn't make money killing Moles. Strychnine is an alkaloid poison. ... Strychnine has been described as dangerous and inhumane and was banned for wildlife management under the Animals (Cruel poisons) Regulations of 1963, and yet its continued use was allowed only with moles. (English legislation). This legislation was taken to Europe by the UK and ratified into EU Law but they decided that the poison had no part in a modern world when there were more humane ways of killing Animals identified as pests
anti	One nation conservatisme is morphing more and more towards ein Volk, ein F√ºhrer. When will the first statues of Enoch Powell and Oswald Mosley be erected?
pro	One of our greatest contributions has been our long history of democratic government. In rejecting the undemocratic centralising power of the EU the UK is once again a standard bearer for democracy. The EU is heading in the wrong direction, it is destroying generations of young people in Greece, France, Italy and Spain through mass unemployment and it is entirely resistant to any reform via the ballot box. We have no choice but to leave it we want to protect the right to elect those who rule us.
anti	One of the basic cornerstones of the European Union is its free market. That means free movement of capital as well as people. The UK would like to have the first but not the second. The UK wants to reap all the rewards but not pay any dues. Does that remind you of anything? One word: NAFTA!
pro	One of the best days of my life when those results came in.
anti	One of the biggest political shit shows in recent history
anti	One of the dumbest moves by the UK since Chamberland signed a deal with Hitler.
anti	One of the good things about Brexit is that I feel more European than ever! Under 30% of the population voted to chain the younger and educated to their flawed political, conservative, defensive, post-colonial ideology based on feeling and emotion rather than economic sense. 73% of 30 year olds and younger are pro remain. Leave a light on Europe, we'll be back!
pro	One of the greatest days in our proud history on behalf of the nation a big thank to Boris and his cabinet , special thank you to Nigel Farage he deserves a knighthood lets make Britain great again, time to clean up our country, bring back national service and bring back the death penalty. GOD SAVE THE QUEEN
pro	One of the happiest days in my life
pro	One of the reasons we left was because of their rules .. just give them finger and tell them no deal. We will survive .
anti	One of the result of ego, this will reflect it's downside in UK soon.
pro	One of the saddest day in the UK .
anti	One of the things I agree with Brexiteers about is it‚Äôs not all about money.For me it‚Äôs also about shared culture,shared experience and international understanding.I also think it‚Äôs about commitment to reform aspects of the EU that need it. You can‚Äôt do that from the outside.
anti	One of the worst and saddest nights in British politics. Such a catastrophic decision, I don't understand why Cameron let this fringe-issue that no one cared about until the start of 2016 go to the public after the AV referendum.
anti	One of those responsible for this Brexit mess, he continues to demonstrate he did not understand international trade when advocating leaving the EU.
pro	One plus of Brexit is that Farage no longer has the European Parliament as a platform and source of funds, which he used to great effect for 20 years. The great irony of UKIP & the Brexit party is that they were funded and promoted by the EU itself. This will now stop
anti	One thing I miss here is that xou didn‚Äòt look into what the membership fees did FOR the UK economy.
pro	One thing is for sure we couldn't go on with the uncertainty of the last 3 years.At least we can move forward now.
anti	One week until the people of #Britain could really f**k things up for generations to come #VoteStay
pro	One word describes the EU now: decline. Declining share of world trade, declining size and GDP, declining world influence, declining repute and standing, declining integrity.....entropy dear Rem-chums, entropy.
pro	One year to go! It can‚Äôt come fast enough.
anti	One year until the UK crashes and burns.
anti	Only 26% of the population voted to leave
anti	Only 47% of the voting population voted to leave in the Advisory referendum. Not the will of the people. Now we will uncover the lies of the Leave Campaign. God help our United Kingdom
pro	Only Germany and Netherlands seem to be doing well in the EU at the moment.
pro	Only Germany matters, all the others are coat tail hangers.
anti	Only a minority of the population (17 million) voted for brexitIt is entirely right that the other 50 million will hold this minority of mainly Brexiteer pensioners responsible for everything that happens from this point forward
anti	Only a smidge in our economy. ¬£10 bn is 7% of how much the goverment put into the nhs each year. Not much at all, and we get billions back in science investments, infrastructure investments and ofcourse a single market.
pro	Only corrupt MPs are trying to stop Brexit !!
pro	Only good deal is a NO DEAL, please just leave, talk or not when we are 100 % out.
anti	Only idiots want to leave. Unity has proven more efficient than divided
pro	Only lies I remember have come from the EU and the biases bbc and remainers trying too scaremonger us to change our minds telling us we didn't know what we voted for well guess what we did and we still stand by our vote freedom is what we wanted and freedom is what we expect WTO no EU alignment no EU rules
pro	Only one chance in a lifetime to free ourselves from the shackles of the cesspit EU, please have the courage to vote LEAVE on Thursday!
anti	Only the British could tyrannically invade and colonise half the world, then leave the EU due to immigration.
anti	Only the Brits do not realise that they are a living joke
pro	Only thing the british Government have done here is show how weak they really are to the EU who will now laugh in May‚Äôs face.. This is a disgrace just leave
pro	Only took 4 years coz of snivelling remainers obstructing democracy
pro	Only two more days and we regain our independence.
pro	Only two more days and we regain our independence. Brilliant!!!
pro	Onwards and upward. Remain is finished. Let‚Äôs make Britain Great again.
pro	Onwards my british friends, fight for your country and your liberty!
anti	Oooh controversial! I‚Äôm not a fan of brexit, I feel that the original referendum came at a time when the public were very disenfranchised with the political system and the outcome din‚Äôt necessarily reflect the true beliefs of the country but more the want for change in the system. Plus the referendum has so many issues with the campaigns on both sides and whether it was binding. What really annoys me though is that research in universities has already been really affected by this and all the unknowns that go with it. With all the things we might struggle with after the big day, it seems very short sighted to do this without a good plan or something that resembles a deal
pro	Open borders, bureaucratic, dictatorial government. The EU is going to fail, and I will enjoy it
anti	Opening sentence: ‚ÄúA multi-millionaire Brexit Party candidate has invented a bin for homeless people to sleep in.‚Äù
pro	"Opinion polls are consistenly showing that the result would be reversed if the referendum were held again. Hahaha in fact your ""polls"" were all pointing that Brexit would win! LOL"
anti	Or they know how fruitless going against the establishment is. The UK is not free. things are probably going to get really bad for the UK soon. The elite will not let the UK go this easy. The EU controls Europe. The UK made a big mistake.
anti	Ordinary UK persons don't even understand the implications of this thing called Brexit. And why would they. Politics are sold in hyperboles and mindlessness in bulk. In fact I doubt even the so called MPs understand the nuances and nth degree ramifications with probability distribution attached.
pro	Other EU countries sell more to us than we sell to them, so if we do leave and they decide to have a strop and refuse to negotiate new deals with us then it will be their loss, not ours.
pro	Other Eu states will follow when we make a success of it.
pro	Other countries are excited about trading with the UK and taking away the EU maket for goods in the UK
pro	Other countries manage to function without membership of EU. And there‚Äôs a whole world to trade with out there.
pro	Other countries should follow,EU Exit Union be your own country again.
pro	Other countries still want to trade with us so tell the EU no deal,they need us more than we need them we don't need them and we certainly don't want all,the millions of eu foreigners here
pro	Other than that the EU is quite flawed
pro	Our Brexit destiny in the 21st Century is a watershed philosophical choice, far beyond immediate trade
anti	Our FPTP allows an `elective dictorship‚Äô.. It would have been exactly the same if Corbyn and his acolytes were in power.. We have a principle free, serial liar in charge, supported by his enablers in the media who will parrot whatever shite he comes out with next
anti	Our Home, Our Friends, Our Neighbours, Our Family, The EU is OUR HOME! Keep Our Star üåü Safe, We will RETURN HOME and One Day Soon! When this country Wakes Up and Realises what it's Done and the Stupidity of Brexit, Listened to the LIES AND PROPAGANDA of Facists, Liars and Criminals funded by CROOKS!
pro	Our country disappeared, but now we can have it back!
anti	Our economy is doomed when we leave, less doomed but still fucked with Mays deal, and UTTERLY doomed if we leave with no deal at all.
pro	Our economy will be stronger outside the EU - we will have the power to strike trade deals, creating 300,000 new jobs. #bbcqt #VoteLeave
anti	Our future our choice... Never give up! Brexit is a shit
anti	Our great leader, the inveterate lier, adulterer, philanderer, Johnson is going to lead the country to greatness...what a hope, more like leading us into complete disaster.
anti	Our influence in the world would be much diminished if we leave. Brexiters are thinking with their emotions, they do not know what would happen. For all they know it would destroy us.
pro	Our liberty bell is ringing for Britain tonight
anti	Our nation got sold out from under us, and a lot of people here in England very much wish they had the option to bail out.
anti	Our only option is to stay in the EU
pro	Our politician's have definitely let us down big time, they will never be trusted again, will not vote for this two main party's ever again. Brexit is Brexit, Leave means Leave.
anti	Our politicians, are 100% guilty of making the mess we are in, no-one else.
anti	Our pound is worthless now
anti	"Our public is more interested in calling the EU ""stupid"" than discussing real issues. We must look like an embarrassment on an international stage and anyone who thinks No Deal is a sign of strength is deluded by abstract ideas."
anti	Our struggle to rejoin, will commence, the moment the UK leaves.
pro	Our trade with EU is a deficit so more money goes out than in.
pro	Our useless remainer politicians would go right back to business as usual, taking orders from Brussels, if we stayed in the EU.
anti	Our worst enemy - our most vicious and organised foe - couldn‚Äôt possibly inflict more damage on this country than have our own Government and Opposition, with
anti	Out all people no brexit !! 10 September out in london no brexit !!
pro	Out for god sake
pro	Out means Out the EU is corrupt and run by Globalist's it was not set up with trade in mind. It was the globalist's lying to the people. We do not want a deal, We do not want the EU we just need to walk away on the 29th a march with out giving the corrupt European state one more Euro. The EU is dead.
pro	Out means out
pro	Out means out we had our vote
pro	Out means out!
pro	Out means out,leave means leave. It does not say deal.
pro	Out means out. Leave means leave. For a free and independent Scotland!
anti	Out of Europe would be a disaster and this is the best thing for this country.
pro	Out of a dictatorship and political institution run by clowns that put themselves first and try preaching to us. Thankfully were out..we're now independent...u don't like it...the EU is just a short trip away
anti	Out of the E.U. and into the unknown.Doom and gloom in Britain from here on in.
pro	Out out now no deal dictator
pro	Out. I am tired of the EU being able to create our laws and regulations, being told what we can and can not do.
pro	Outrageous .. soon as we leave this bunch the better
anti	Outside Europe our economy will suffer and these elderly and/or economically inactive can expect smaller and smaller pensions and crappy health and social services and dwindling benefits and social security levels as things deteriorate over the next 2 to 3 decades.
pro	Outside of London, away from university campuses, off the Guardian forums the English Leave vote remains rock solid. Absolutely rock solid. So bring on a 2nd referendum and let's shut these metropolitan elites up once and for all. Of course Leave voters should not have to pay a single penny towards this 2nd in/out referendum so the Remainers should crowd fund the entire cost. Maybe Blair & Mandelson can kick in a few of their dubious millions. And when Leave wins yet again all the MPs and members of the House of Lords who campaigned endlessly for this 2nd vote should all resign from their positions as they clearly disrespected the people and so are unfit for office So bring it on. Let's shut these deluded & elitist Remainers up once and for all! B.R.I.N.G. I.T. O.N.
pro	Outside of the EU and on the edge of Europe. Independent; but hugely wealthy, and in control of European policy in a way that we could never be whilst having our wealth stolen, and imprisoned in a morass of red tape and EU diktats. After all it‚Äôs who holds the purse strings that are really in control.
pro	Outside the EU, Britain could resume its place as a powerful independent power.
pro	Over 50% of English/ British voted LEAVE. Including me. Great victory
pro	Over 50% of English/ British voted LEAVE. Including me. Great victory......
pro	Over the top bully tactics from the despicable EU. Designed to make things as difficult as it can for the UK. I only wish our government had the guts to do the same in return.
pro	Over-regulation by the EU has cost the British economy over ¬£125 billion. Freed from EU, the UK economy would thrive like Norway or Switzerland ‚Äì two of the most successful states in Europe.
pro	Overwhelming majority in this country back you Boris, do a deal with the Brexit Party and get this done!
pro	PLEASE VOTE TO LEAVE
pro	PLEASE do not vote for yvette cooper in the next elections she MUST be deselected for her traitorous attempt on delaying brexit ....!!!!
anti	PLS don't leave EU!
pro	PROPAGANDA..... Europe is united. We dont need EUROPEAN UNION TO UNITE US.... Disgusting BANKERS around the world BUILD THAT AFTER WW2 to profit from The peoples taxes and laws that they passed for more profits...,
pro	PURE ANTI BREXIT PROPAGANDA FAKE NEWS
anti	Painful, unpleasant and costly. That‚Äôs where we are.
pro	Parliament is filled with narcissists and psychopaths, good to see Brexiteers standing up to them.
anti	Parliament should cancel Brexit because the country is too divided on it.
pro	Parliament should have NO say, the decision was made in the VOTE TO LEAVE. MAY IS THE PROB:EM.
anti	Parliament votes for flying pigs only to be disappointed to be told that flying pigs still don't exist.
pro	Part of the price we would have to pay for staying in the unelected EU would be to turn over our Army and our defence systems to a foreign entity that could in time turn that same army against its own people with impunity
pro	Parts of the EU are bitter at our decision to leave because, as a net contributor, we subsidise huge parts of it
pro	Patriotism is our strength!
pro	Peace has descended ..... welcome back the Real World ..
pro	Peace in EU? What's happening in Balkans? Bloody war. What's EU did? F nothing!
pro	Peace, Prosperity, Freedom Revolution ........All Hail to Boris - Make it Real Baby!!
anti	Pensioners that lived all their lives without learning anything voted leave nevertheless none thought through where their pension founds coming from !
anti	People DON'T want to leave why can't she understand? THE FAR RIGHT DOESN'T REPRESENT US
pro	People act like the EU is a perfect organisation keeping the Uk from falling into a frenzy , I would personally like to live in a country which is free to decide their own laws and policies. Which ever way you slice it whether how nice, supportive or beneficial immigrants are i would like a country that worries about sorting its own citizens problems and welfare before other countries. I don't think that makes independence supporters idiots or racists. But hey.. I think John Oliver put it perfectly we just hate other countries for no good reason and would portray us like that just for a Segway 5 average jokes
pro	People acting like Britain is gonna drift off into the middle of the Atlantic.
anti	People actually thought that all the immigrants are gonna get shipped off tomorrow
anti	People are better and stronger wen they work together so why did u leave Euro u damm Englisch idiots!
anti	People are going to look back in horrified disbelief that a relatively prosperous nation chose to beggar itself because The Daily Fucking Mail didn't like brown people
anti	People are leaving Britain.. companies are leaving.. what is good for Brexit? I'm going to be french or Irish
anti	People are pathologically obcessed with ONE thing. No more immigrants. How stupid they are because it WON'T be stopped.
pro	People decide. People have decided. Out.
pro	People don't seem to realise that US in the UK are in a better position than the EU since if they don't give us what we want they lose access to alot of the natural resources services and the 2.8 trillion market we have.
anti	People in UK don't understand that history, imperialism and colonialism is dead, now there are global emergent forces in Asia, Africa and South America. There is not future for UK.
anti	People in the UK are moaning about EU membership fees but wait until the European Tariffs on British exports happens (like on Beef and Sheep)...its going to be ugly. Its is every French farmers wet dream to get British meat banned from store shelves.
anti	People keep saying that the ¬£350 million the UK gives to the EU each year is like dumping loads of money away but they are completely missing the point of how beneficial it is to us.
anti	People may not realise how the EU strengthens our rights, we cant leave...
anti	People need to realise that the EU referendum isn't about immigrants, it's about human rights. Leave and we have none
pro	People of the UK, I congratulate you on your full freedom. You did it
pro	People of the UK, I congratulate you on your full freedom. You did it! So Mexico has its Cinco De Mayo and the United Kingdom has its 31st of January to celebrate. Make it a holiday with beers üçª and fill the pubs and be waving your Union Jacks for you have given hope to other nations in Europe to break away and reclaim their cultural identity. You even gave hope to us Apaches.
anti	People really don't realise how many problems this country will face by leaving the EU
pro	People rejected EU becuase it is highjacked by unelected dictators
pro	People should realise that Brexit is anti-European Union, not anti-immigrant.
anti	People should stop pointing the finger and look in the mirror. This country is a joke built on closed minded, greedy people. Soon they'll all be regretting the decision they made when they see it backfire
anti	People struggle to comprehend how the NAZI party managed to come to power in Germany in 1933. Brexit is very similar. The people of The UK have been manipulated same as the people of Germany were.
anti	People that think they are safe and won't be affected by this should really go study economics 101. If tens or hundreds of thousands lose their job, there will be less demand on the market and every company will suffer. The EU gave you access to the most prosperous markets on superpower terms, if you think the UK alone will get anything near that you are delusional.
anti	People that's chose to leave should not be allowed to go to any of EU countries
pro	People voted Brexit because a bunch of idiots in Belgium were bossing you around without any accountability.
anti	People voted Brexit because they are stupid, ignorant, racist or xenophobic; there is little there to understand.
anti	People voted Leave only because they saw their current situation, were dissatisfied with it, and believed they could improve it by taking the choice offered to them
anti	People voted against immigration and thought Brexit will remedy this . Yeah here you go .Well done
pro	People voted for Leave without this ongoing mess of deal or no deal..Leave means Leaves..go for NO DEAL
pro	People voted out as they do not want to be run by an undemocratic EU, leader who are unaccountable .
pro	People voted to leave. What is it that they don't understand?
pro	People want sovereignty and their vote respected.
anti	People who support brexit are fucking morons
anti	People who voted LEAVE will regret their decision!
pro	People who voted remain were not true patriots
pro	People who were for remain (including media) are just trying to frame it like nobody really wanted Brexit. It was just an accident. Wrong.
anti	People with their lives ahead of them have to suffer the consequences of a choice by those who are nearly dead.
anti	People would rather immigration got cut and became poor then having more migration and be more prosper. I think the globalist would lose out the most and bankers
pro	"People, lets be totally honest with ourselves. The EU is crumbling. The French want out, Italy will leave soon, Austria is considering leaving, Hungary will most likely leave within the next 2 years. The people are unhappy with the EU, it doesn't matter what ""the facts say"" or ""what the experts say"". People do not like the EU anymore."
pro	Peoples Vote is what we want
pro	Perhaps if the forces trying to stop brexit (peoples vote, citizens assembly, meaningful vote etc) had channelled their efforts (and millions) into accepting the vote and trying to get the best exit we wouldn't be in this mess.
anti	Perhaps that is one of the subconscious reason for Leavers, who seem to genuinely enjoy reliving War fantasies that they never experienced for real.
pro	Perhaps the British tax payer should be bullied into paying for the exceptionally irresponsible fiscal policies of several EU members.
anti	Perhaps the Global Little Britain fantasists will realise that the trio of the Union's biggest players could dominate the future of the Union for decades to come but they thought they had no chance to outsmart France and Germany so the only thing they could do is surrender and cut and run.
pro	Perhaps you don't understand us Brits, we've been alone before, it's nothing new. Watch this space. The British are coming!
pro	Personally I dont want to have anything to do with remainers. I'd like them to leave. I dont consider them as part of our community.
pro	Personally I voted to leave the EU because I didn‚Äôt want drunken old megalomaniacs I didn‚Äôt vote for, deciding my future. The UK never voted to join Soros‚Äôglobalist superstate, they voted to join a trade/travel agreement. The EU screws the British worker and violates the fishermen while our woefully pathetic useless MPs turn a blind eye for ‚Äúsome reason ¬£¬£¬£‚Äù.
pro	Personally I‚Äôve wanted to leave the EU since 1993, when I finally realised that the globalist EU project was all about moving democracy away from the British people & putting our fate in the hands of foreign politicians in a distant land, 90% of whom were not accountable to us.
pro	Personally my attitude to the bloody EU is just leave, don't¬†give them a penny and trade on WTO rules!
anti	Personally there's a snowball's chance in hell of me uniting with Brexiters.I'll accept that I'm wrong and happily do it if it proves a roaring success, of course.So, like I said, a snowball's chance in hell.
pro	Personally, I flushed the EU down the toilet back in 2001. It's taking a LONG time for the filth to swirl down into the gutter, isn't it?
pro	Personally, I made a ton of money off of the event of Brexit and I'll likely make more money once some taxes are gotten rid of that couldn't happen while in the EU.
anti	Personally, I think that the government should come to its senses and call off Brexit. If the UK leaves with no deal it would be a disaster and the UK will end up becoming even more irrelevant than they already are.
anti	Personally, I think the EU, while far from perfect, has had a positive effect on the UK as a whole.
anti	Personally, I think they would have been better off in the EU, but they voted to leave, so that's their decision.
pro	Personally, as a true liberal, I voted leave because I believe a smaller governing body is better for the people as they are more effective for the smaller amount of people they serve
pro	Personally, as a true liberal, I voted leave because I believe a smaller governing body is better for the people as they are more effective for the smaller amount of people they serve. An unelected closed off group of people, shouldn't be able to dictate laws to 28 different countries. I don't feel that the same laws would be effective in two culturally diverse countries.
anti	Personally...I think we're better together! ‚úåüèº #voteremain
pro	Peter French another delusional remoaner, hate to break it to you but we are out and will forever remain that way.
pro	Pictured together, the two prime reasons that so many people voted to leave the EU - Junckers and Barnier, arrogant, self-serving, vastly over-rewarded, and self-perpetuating - no way to be rid of them, other than to leave their little racket.
pro	Pissed they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve lost all that tax revenue.
anti	Pity you weren't there when a million of us marched to stop this madness. A minority of the electorate voted for pro Brexit parties in the general election. Opinion polls confirm majority is still anti Brexit. We are leaving without popular consent.
pro	Plan A = leave,there is no plan B
anti	Playing into the hands of capitalists who are only too pleased to fan the flames of panic.
anti	Please Brexiteers stop the WA. I hope the UK destroys itself after the 29th March. This would be so funny.
anti	Please Britain you haven't got an empire anymore, Britain is a weak country now, Spain and Portugal used to have huge empires and only got influence in the world due to the EU.
anti	Please be aware that Scotland and Ireland voted to remain, but apparently democracy has no place in these countries. Their voices are drowned out. Not a good arrangement!
anti	Please continue fighting to stop this Brexit madness.
anti	Please do a video about Brexit in 2018 and the future of England if it leaves the EU
pro	Please don‚Äôt give up nowüí™üí™be example for other Nations! Go_for_Brexit
pro	Please everyone - you must ignore the vote in camp - they are telling terrible lies everyday. Yes it will be hard for a couple of years but then we're sorted. √Ç¬£55 million a day better off. How can that possibly be bad? Save our country - vote leave
pro	Please god END THIS Weve had enough Brexit 31st and MOVE ON
pro	Please just get out ! I‚Äôd rather eat grass than be controlled but the EU !!!!
anti	Please leave out the anoying topic of conflict between British and Germans. You re related. And both great nations and admirable democracies. We wish we were British or Germans. Stay in EU. NO ONE will ever challenge the position of UK as a top economical and financial power.
pro	Please let there be a BREXIT.
anti	Please please #VoteRemain tomorrow my fellow Brits! Xxx
anti	Please remember that at least half of Brits, including me, are totally against the madness of brexit.
pro	Please remove the flags says it all really. The EU feels threatened by the identity of nation states, because its underlying objective is to disempower and ultimately dismantle them. NO THANK YOU AND BYE BYE
pro	Please stop telling us EU is utopia because we don‚Äôt care wether it is or not.
anti	Please stop the UK , Scotland wants to get off
pro	Please what advantages of staying in? losing jobs is a myth so don‚Äôt tell me lies about that one, we have always been able to go and live and holiday abroad so that wouldn‚Äôt change. There is nothing but debt austerity and foreign criminals being allowed while we suffer.
anti	Please, please, please, do hold your breath until the UK rejoins.
anti	Politicians calling brexit ‚Äúdone‚Äù is a horrifying indictment into how little planning they have put in going forwards.
pro	Polls are a complete waste of time, they can mean anything you want them to mean, more remoaners propaganda.
anti	Pompous British think they are the center of the European universe. The EU can go to NYC for financial services, uh oh Brits looks like you going to be hoisted on your own petard.
anti	Poor ignorant fools, they don't even realize that leaving the EU will only make the situation worse. It's like when people killed cats and dogs during the black death, which only caused the disease to proliferate
anti	Poor little Britain, sat sulking in the corner. No longer great, and soon no longer Britain, but only England and N Ireland, with Scotland and (probably) Wales gone from the Union. What have you fools done to yourselves?
anti	Poor misguided souls. By the time they realise the extent of the damage they have caused, it will be too late. Britain will be the Poor Man of Europe once again.
pro	Poor remoaners. Bbc and guardian, ch 4, Sky keep giving them false hope. Fake news. But they deserve it due to their arrogance.
pro	Poor soro$. All of that money spent on globalization for nothing!
anti	Poor, old farts, not educated, ill informed voted leave and that's a fact.
anti	Poor, poor Britain. Choosing, all on your own, the destruction of your way of life.
anti	Poorly informed is a very mild way of describing those who were caught by the Leave campaign. Ignorance is supposed to be bliss but it has got us into a terrible mess.
pro	Pop the Champagne Brits! You are free to be a sovereign nation once more!
pro	Populism wins. Brexit wins. The people win #Brexit
pro	Possibly, but for the UK it will be worth it in the long run. The EU will suffer much more than the UK, which in effect means the European members, which, personally, I'm sorry for. We voted to do the best for the UK and unfortunately the rest of Europe has to live with it or do the same and get out of that corrupt, non electable bunch of cretans.
anti	Poverty....welcome in uk
pro	Praise God!
pro	Praise the Lord, we're out.
pro	Praying we leave the EU
pro	Pre EU we had more jobs such as steel works, mines, pot banks etc hospitals and schools were better
anti	Pre referendum bbc interviewed expats in sunny spain, this particular group was concerned with the amount of foreigners in uk and were voting brexit
pro	Precisely! Escaping the clutches of the EU is paramount. Everything else can be sorted later.
pro	Predictable remoaners response. Read it again remoaners with the bias blinkers off. Article 24 of WTO has potential.
pro	Prediction: The EU will pretend to be negotiating all the way up until the end of the process and then slam the door shut giving them nothing and blaming it all on the UK.
anti	Prepare for much worse as the economy goes into decline. There will be real anger directed at Brexiters if that happens.
anti	Prepare for the anti EU idiots in the comments.
anti	Presumably Leave voters in Kent will not be stockpiling as they can go for a days shopping in Calais
pro	Pretty much everything here is a lie- the real truth is that economic co-operation is a good thing but that the attendant and unnecessary political union has led to mass corruption, people want to preserve democracy whilst still free-trading and the E.U. prevents this- let's all of us, the whole world, start to free trade WITHOUT undemocratic corrupt bureaucrats.
anti	Pro Brexit pineapple jackets blocking traffic at Parliament Square today
pro	Pro Brexit yank here
pro	"Pro British exit is not about ""hate"" ""intolerance"" or ""anti-diversity"". It's about democracy, sovereignty and identity. #Brexit #VoteLeave"
pro	Pro- Brexit all the way. The people voted and Brexit was wanted.
anti	Pro-tip for anyone who burned an EU flag and objects to being called thick and racist. If you stop being xenophobic, thick and racist then you will not be called xenophobic, thick and racist. It's not quantum mathematics people.
anti	Probably should stay in the EU.
anti	Problem is, the Brexit was mistake from the start, isteed of leaving the EU, and becoming a tiny little nation on the wimp of multinational Cons and billionars, the people should stayed and tried to reform the EU.
pro	Problem with remainers they don't and won't see the benefit's of leaving because they are stuck to far up their Ar**s
pro	Proceed with BREXIT as the voters want. The fragile EU will have no choice other than renegotiate trade with a U.K.
pro	"Professor David Blake, Director of the Pensions Institute at the Cass Business School, has written a paper outlining 10 reasons why staying in the EU ranges from ""pretty bad to very, very bad"" for pensions. His devastating analysis came as new research by Vote Leave has revealed that just one EU directive due to come in shortly will increase the cost of British pensions by ¬£328 million a year. 'Remainers' you have been warned."
pro	Project Fear = Project Fact Well done England, truly well done
pro	Project Fear is alive and well! The resolve of the remainders is very apparent in this video.
anti	Project Fear is certainly working. Every time I hear one of those Brexit people I become more fearful of what they are trying to do to our country.
pro	Project Fear pushing the speculation button again ! Get Real ! It is all about immigration and control of our borders !
anti	Project Get Brexit Done is nearly finished, project Keep Stiff Upper Lip will begin shortly!
pro	Pros: everything cons: nothing Come on. I support brexit but it's obviously going to have negatives. It's going to have positives too. But we can't really say what either will be until we see what the details are.
pro	Prosperity DESPITE us stuck in the dead-weight EU.
anti	Protect your rights at work ‚Äì and vote to REMAIN in Europe today. #VoteRemain
pro	Proud of you, UK :D
anti	Proud to be European and a part of Europe. Proud of our strong economy that wouldn't exist without immigration. #Remain #Bremain #StrongerIn
anti	Proud to still be European (for now) Ashamed by the behaviour of the Brexit Party MEPs
anti	Ps: please, do not forget History. Nationalism is not the solution...
pro	Pull OUT of EU with NO Deals!! and TELL EU Tough Luck Ya'll. British Don't NEED EU .
anti	Pulling out is not Always a reliable method
anti	Pulling out of the huge European single market and going it alone in a hostile global economy can't possibly do anything other than damage our economy which is what many of the Brexit brigade want, in order to reduce net migration.
anti	Pushing to NO DEAL. 2 weeks mayhem.. emergrncy blocking brexit.. 2nd vote . Back inn.. case closed .
pro	Put simply. Remain = same as now i.e. crap. Leave = new opportunities i.e. sunshine.

anti	Putin & Trump want Britain to leave the European Union. No one else in their right minds wants this.
anti	Putin got what he wanted. Look at the US and the UK. What a mess. The UK should get another vote at it now that they see the mess it is. We get a chance 2 years from now to dig our way out from this dump of Trump.
anti	Putin is smiling.
anti	Putin loves brexit veeery much, indeed! It is his second best Investment!
anti	Putin plan is working faster than I thought.
anti	Putting it simply. We‚Äôre screwed.
pro	Putting the UK and its citizens first Doesn't make you racist!!!!
anti	"Question ""What exactly are these benefits the working class family will get leaving the EU? Typical Brexiter answer ""Shut up remoaner, you lost"""
anti	Question to those in the #Brexit cult: Why do you support the possibility of my 82-year-old dad, who suffers from vascular dementia & diabetes, not being able to get the medicine he needs after March? It should go without saying, but that's a monumentally evil thing to do.
anti	Quite right. This fraudulent #tory government are only interested in their own jobs. They have created #xenophobia and division and complicit by ignoring #corruption with #Brexit #StopBrexit
anti	Quite sickening how this brexit vote - engineered by a tissue of lies - is causing so much chaos. The BoE had little option, but ultra-low interest rates are hardly to be welcomed - especially by savers. The sooner we reverse brexit the better.
anti	Quite, and therefore it would have been more sensible to vote to¬†not¬†leave. We could have demanded another referendum at any time in the future, after all.

anti	Racist a.......s! What shocked me was my local petrol shop owner, a relatively recent immigrant from Sri Lanka told me he had voted Leave. He said ‚Äòall the local Asians have done the same‚Äô. When I asked him why he told me ‚Äò ..there are too many immigrants‚Äô!
anti	Reading some recent articles in Der Speigel which gives a good insight into the European view of things. I think they have come to the conclusion that perhaps the UK is better off out of the EU for a while, let what happens happen. They predict the UK will be buffeted around by superpowers such as America and China et al. There can‚Äôt be a single person left in the country who thinks any good will come of Brexit, from high-profile Brexiters such as Rees-Mogg whose city firm quietly relocated to Ireland, and to Farage trousering his EU salary and building up his EU pension rights whilst obtaining German passports for his children. Of the political Brexit class, Der Speigel has been informed that they are so entrenched, they are ‚Äòbeyond reason‚Äô, with absolutely nothing that comes from the EU table able to satisfy them. Of the ordinary person, leavers seem to be relishing the suffering to come with sangfroid and a Dunkirk spirit. There was a man filmed in McDonalds a few weeks ago on a racist rant claiming ‚Äòour entire civilisation was created by white men‚Äô. Brexiters claim to fame will be that the UK will be the only country in the World to have voluntarily regressed and made itself poorer; Brexit, the famous picture of the ascent of man, primate to Homo Sapiens, gradually standing up, but going in reverse.
anti	Reading these comments, I'm embarrased to be English üòê
pro	Reading this i would say a no deal is very good for the uk and very bad for the eu. The eu dont want a deasl so we leave and undercut them Thats business and this is what this is all about.
pro	Real progress will come and England's water supplies will be free. Thank you Boris Johnson.
pro	Realism and reality is certainly not appreciate these columns by those diehard pro-Remain fanatics who have not yet been cured of their Europhilia.
anti	Reality Check: Could Brexit be negotiated in two years?
anti	"Reality bites, babe! I can remember the author of this piece saying, ""if we vote leave, they'll give us a better deal...."" How times have changed. Just remember who brought you this shitshow so they can be held to account, and remember the security and prosperity you gave up for your magic Brexit beans."
pro	Really curious how the EU will function now that the UK has left. More countries to follow?

pro	Really hope this is the beginning of the end of EU that killed all the economy of Italy
pro	Really looking forward to the EU crashing and burning when they can't cope without the UK's cash.
pro	Really, even though I disagree in full with your statement, you‚Äôre still entitled to your opinion; brexit is pretty great!

anti	Reasons to be a Remainer? . The following support Leave: 1.Putin 2. Trump 3.Corbyn 4. Farage 5. BNP members Judge a man by his friends, judge a policy by its supporters.
anti	Recaptured sovereignty is a falsehood
pro	Recent polls by Tony Blair org suggests a massive rise in people wanting out and May to deliver. If anything its has hardened due to Brussels. A reverse on the referendum would be a breach of democracy and the people‚Äôs will. I know of no one who has changed their mind!
pro	Rees-Mogg's points are precisely why I voted to leave the EU.
pro	Referendum losers can go live among the world war losers and they can all lose together. And don't worry, when the EU wants to expand into Russia and the middle east with an EU army, it'll purely be in your interests!
anti	Referendum was never a sane or sensible way to decide the issue
anti	Reforming the EU, making it better. Not leaving it, but changing it from within.
anti	Regretful Leave voters exist. I am one.
pro	Regrettably leave. It started as the European Coal and Steel Community shortly after WW2 - which obviously, due to it's name - had a focus that was clear and concise with only 6 founding members. It is now just a great big mess consisting of far too many countries with far too many different agendas.
pro	Rejoice! Tonight we bath in the tears of remoaners. Feels good.
pro	Rejoice! We are free! Our fisherman can now be free! They can fish for fish like never before. Fuck you EU! Ha...we are going to be a beacon to the world with all our British fish.

pro	"Remain camp says there's no post #brexit economic plan, what's ""their plan"" when the last ounce of UK sovereignty is diminished #voteleave"
anti	Remain in the EU, leaving will be a disaster
pro	Remain is not right for the UK.
anti	Remain is now the majority view of the voting public.
anti	Remain kind, remain open, remain inclusive, remain tolerant, remain together. #VoteRemain #Brexit #StrongerIn
pro	Remain means Continue along the Path of Ever Closer Union.‚Äù ‚ÄúLeave means Leave.‚Äù
anti	Remain should have emphasised the benefits of EU membership and appealed to a sense of collaboration, community and cooperation.
pro	Remain should not be on the table..that ship has sailed.
anti	Remain were 2 of the countries of the UK, virtually all the Cities, Universities and colleges, and the majority of all those under 52. Remain had all the political parties, Unions Businesses, Nato, the UN, the IMF. Leave were a ramshackle bunch of old age pensioners and a bunch of moronic village idiots - and we allowed that lot to destroy this country - nice one you morons!
pro	Remain will win and historians will look back on this moment and say this was when our country died
anti	Remain will win, and after that the damn politicians will need to do something tangible to address the real concerns people had before they voted Leave to start healing this fractured country.
pro	Remain will win, with a swing induced by the Cox murder. What a travesty.
anti	Remain. Given that we do so much trade with the countries of the EU I think it's in our national interest to have a say in how the EU is run
anti	Remain. Here in NI we are pretty reliant on grants from the EU. Farming is one of the main industries and about half of a farmers income comes directly from the EU. Invest NI, which financially supports a huge number of the bigger employers gets most of their money from the EU. I'm sure it's the same in Scotland and north England. The UK gov only cares about London. If they were in charge itd be a much worse place. This is all without mentioning that Northern Ireland has a physical border with the EU (Ireland) which none of those leave bastards have even tried to address.
anti	Remain. I have a full range of economic, political and social arguments for remaining a member of the EU. But, it all boils down to - I don't want to live on a planet where Nigel Farage is right.
anti	Remain. I want my daughter and her future children to have human rights that Cameron (et al) has been trying to erode. If we weren't in the EU we'd be even more spied on than we already unreasonably are. Voting leave might as well be signing up to have cameras installed in our houses, recording everything like we are criminals. Leaving won't solve immigration at all, nor will it solve any of our financial issues, especially those caused by poor tax evasion management and an unwillingness to change the loopholes.
anti	Remain. It would be a disaster for Wales to leave the EU. I am also invested in the EU project and just don't want to leave anyway, but logically as a Welshman I cannot vote to leave the EU because I would literally be voting to cut off a pretty large funding stream to Wales that would not be replaced by any UK government (changes to the Barnett formula are hard, and Scotland also doesn't want them sooooo).
anti	Remain. My only regret is not taking seriously the chance of leave winning. I just assumed there was no way leave would win so I didn't bother engaging with any debates or discussions in the subject.
anti	Remain. Only regrets was not realising how old fashioned my family is.
anti	Remain. The safe, sensible, sane choice.
pro	Remainer's are weird, they're like the community that uses crystals to cleans their negative energy......but crystals dont work now do they.
pro	Remainers - its over - move on We have a Country to rebuild
pro	Remainers are George Soros's shock troops
pro	Remainers are a nasty bunch. I genuinely believe they have a mental disorder.
pro	Remainers are all one dimensional thinkers
pro	Remainers are desperate for Brexit to hurt the economy to protect their arguments but the fact is that we will likely get free trade deals with not just the EU but many other countries and in the long run can flourish outside. The constant bombardment of negativity from them will not stop anything.
pro	Remainers are still going through the stages of grief, and I take no pleasure in seeing them writhe, however much they schemed to thwart the democratic will of the British people. The reality is, the UK is leaving the anti-democratic, hyper-regulated embrace of the Continent, and Britain is choosing its own path, subject to continuing democratic oversight. You don't like it? Don't play games with technicalities and misrepresent your opponents. Win the next election. Everyone will respect that result.
pro	"Remainers are, almost exclusively, bourgeois, with very little loyalty to anything but capital and nothing but contempt for the poor and the working classes. If they can be richer and posher under a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, they will favor dictatorship. They have no allegiance to anything but money and themselves. The EU is a dictatorship that helped make them richer, hence they love the EU and hate the UK. More and more people are realizing that bourgeois liberalism, or ""neoliberalism,"" is anti-democracy. Just look at how the bourgeois liberals spent four years trying to undo a democratic vote for Brexit in the UK and a vote for a president they don't like in the US. Point this out and they pull out their favorite canard: the ""Russian hackers."" As if a few Facebook ads were all it took for the people their policies have ruined to turn against them."
anti	"Remainers can easily debate the negatives of leaving the EU, but have difficulty discussing the benefits of leaving - probably because there are no leaving benefits. Brexiteers leaving debate is usually ""just get on with it"", without drawing remainers attention to the benefits of leaving the EU. There appears to be a lack of intellect on one side of the debate."
pro	Remainers conveniently forget that they have spent the last 3 years predicting that we would crash out with a no deal Brexit and that an exit deal (with a transition period) wouldn‚Äôt make it through Parliament - facts never bothered them before
pro	Remainers have just ceased to exist! Happy Brexit, my dear fellow Brexiteers. We kept the faith, we fought and we won.
pro	Remainers kept talking about risking the UKs wealth. I see millions of people on the minimum wage and zero hour contracts. Where is this so called wealth, exactly?
pro	Remainers like telling everyone what to do.
pro	Remainers made it clear a long time ago they never understood the concept of negotiating.
pro	Remainers need to get over it, it was an act of democracy, a choice by the people.
pro	Remainers that think they can win an argument with the EU have lost touch with reality.?
pro	Remainers told me that the UK is too small to make trade deals and that they could not be done in time before we left the EU. The UK made 20 trade deals with 35 countries, started negotiations with 19 more and made trade continuity deals with the US, Aust and NZ.
pro	Remainers unable to accept the results are causing the division.
pro	Remainers, do you remember when you rode a bike for the first time without stabilisers or a parent's guiding hand? That‚Äôs Brexit. You may, like that child, feel nervous and frightened now, but the sense of freedom and control will be exhilarating.
pro	Remainers, everyone: calling anyone who voted differently an idiot.
pro	Remainers, let it go.
pro	Remainers??? Move to France..just wild guess
pro	Remaining in any customs union or arangement is not leaving.
anti	"Remaining in the EU is ""better for the education system""! Incredible. ""I believe the EU can be reformed""! Amazing. A triumph of hope over experience."
anti	"Remaining in the EU was the ""good deal."""
pro	Remaining is a risk, a deal is a risk, no deal is a risk. We voted to leave, leave already.
pro	Remember President Trump made all of this Possible God Bless the people of the UK Great see you got your country back
pro	Remember people - this is just the beginning of our battle - these Globalists always re-group. The fight for our freedom must continue and we must re-double our efforts - the force that we are fighting against is immense. The Common Law Courts are our most vital resource for wresting free of this global tyrannical machine.
pro	Remember seeing the result in the morning and jumping for joy. Fuck the EU. Fuck globalism. Rule Britannia!
anti	Remember that with a No Deal Brexit , UK drivers won't even have a valid license to drive in the EU .
pro	Remember they have never lived in a free country, they have been brought up under the dictatorship of the EU and every day at school they were told 'what a lovely thing the EU was' - of course they love the EU - that is all they have ever known.
anti	Remember when they let the british public decided on the name of a boat? And the result was disregarded because they felt the public's decision was too silly to follow through on? That was just the name of a boat.
pro	Remind me, why do we want to remain? Go Brexit!
anti	Remind us why deliberately harming our closest trading partners is a good idea
pro	Reminder that #Brexit hasn't led to the mass exodus of City jobs that some feared - and few signs it will either.
pro	Reminder: the European Project has destroyed job opportunities for an entire generation of young people around the continent.
anti	Reminds me of *Lost*. Always some new twist to keep the ratings up.
pro	Remoaners aren't they, the lot of them? Some mor√® in the closet than others but remoaners just the same
pro	Remoaners, why are you still here? Go emigrate. Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
anti	Removing the freedom that we had. That‚Äôs about as undemocratic as it‚Äôs possible to be. Held captive against our will. Is this an illegal act?
pro	Rename this video 'How Europe lost Britain'. The UK had problems with EU integration/interference for decades, both Labour and Tory Prime MInisters had issues with it. We complained regularly. Nothing was done to placate us, so guess what? We left.
pro	Reneging filthy SCUM eu bullies..
pro	Replace the EU‚Äôs bad trade deals with our own good ones.
pro	Representative democracy, true. But millions of Brits rejected the European representative democracy
pro	Respect democracy. Nothing else matters. People of uk made the decision already. Change the result and you kill democracy forever.
pro	Respect the people‚Äôs vote
pro	Respect to you Brits!!!
pro	Restore Britain's national sovereignty and parliamentary democracy
pro	Returning confidence to the housing market
anti	Revert Brexit is the only way for a sustainable NHS. But you only care about the 'will' of the people based upon a NON-binding referendum based on lies.
anti	Revoke Article 50. Stay in EU. All other options are impoverished in comparison.
anti	Revoke Article 50. no-deal is suicide.
pro	Rightly or wrongly a decision has been made, now we must move forward as best as we can
anti	Rip Uk
anti	Rip brexit. Great day for people in parliament who put the interests of their country before a populist vote based on lies which would damage it. Intelligence and reason are finally prevailing!
anti	Rising rent and NHS pressures are nothing to do with the EU though. In fact, the Tories are the ones most responsible for pressures on the NHS since they are the ones who are in direct control of its funding and are deliberately starving it of the necessary money required. In spite of this, the doctors and nurses and all the staff in the NHS do an incredible job.
pro	Risk life and limb to Brexit!! The EU is getting real scary. If you dont get out now you will never be able to get out... God save Britain, and maybe the queen will save the people from the treachery of their leaders!!!
pro	Robbins must have deliberately negotiated the worst deal in history to help delay or stop Brexit.
pro	Roll of 2017 with the big fat yes to get out. lets leave the eu and not end up like Greece.
pro	Roll on March 29 and WTO rules! Make the UK great again!
anti	Rubbish - this country is already being torn apart by a greedy elite of brexiteers! Happy to condemn future generations to a much less attractive future due to some delusional 'freedom' - roll on general election
pro	Rubbish we will be fine. It will be difficult at first but we will rise to being Great Britain once more
anti	Rubbish. Airbus is responsible for 100,000 British jobs and he‚Äôs the CEO. It‚Äôs no different to repeated warnings from South African CEO of carmakers etc. The Brexidiots look for any excuse not to listen and blame everyone else for the fact Brexit is not achievable.
pro	Rubbish. How much influence did we really bring while we were full members of the EU? Dream on.
pro	Rubbish. Paying billions for a trade DEFICIT and unlimited low-skilled EU immigration etc etc. is a very bad idea. It's as straightforward and obvious as that. More importantly, the rotten and corrupt EU organisation is completely undemocratic.
pro	Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves! Britains never never never shall be slaves!

anti	Sad dark times ...they might drag us out of the EU but they can‚Äôt drag the EU out our hearts
anti	Sad day but I'm honestly done with politics. Between the clownshow that is Trump in America and Brexit it's too toxic and not worth the mental strain it puts on our lives. I'll keep up with key policy changes but there's no point following this circus day to day.
anti	Sad day for Britain.

anti	Sad times. 2020 is a bad year.
anti	Sad to be British today; we were once respected the world over for pragmatism and tolerance. We are about to start the only trade talks in history where the starting point is free trade and we are going to discuss what barriers we put up. You couldn't invent it!!! Churchill will be turning in his grave.

anti	Sad to say, but the whole #brexit shambles leaves me ashamed & embarrassed to be British. The effects on science & the economy will be devastating. Image how we‚Äôd flourish if we #remain. I‚Äôm far from the only academic thinking the next move should be abroad & away from this mess.
anti	Sad to see you leave, but we wish you all the best, all that jazz.
anti	Sad, angry, and scared for our country this morning.
anti	Sad, really sad. Why all the hate towards hard working people? Brexit really is Brexshit
pro	Saddened by reports from Brussels, but the message is clear, we are not safer in Europe #brexit #voteleave
anti	Sadly normal leavers wont really benefit from Leave and they are likely to suffer from it.
anti	Sadly the majority voted for the soundbites and had no clue what it was about. Mist I speak with say things like. Get back our laws.. we had our laws already.. have sovereigncy.. we had it already. Stop EU controlling us... we were a voice in the EU and did control ourselves
anti	Sadly what we are experiencing now is the reality of Brexit, the country was divided as the house of commons is and it would be impossible to get in to concences when the out date is so close.
anti	Sadly, this is the downside of a 'free press'.
anti	Said it before. Completely regret my vote. I got caught up in the anti EU/sovereignty fervor and was just desperate for some big change somewhere, somehow. I never thought of it in the sense that the EU is essentially a safety check against disgusting governments like our current one and that EU funding does a lot, even for the disadvantaged. Neck, I feel the EU supports the poor of this country better than the actual government. I'm hoping and praying that Brexit gets called off.
anti	Sajid Javid fails to dismiss claims by three experts that Britain will be a lot less safe, whatever Brexit deal is agreed
anti	Same I'm 6 months too young :( wanted to boost the remain campaign

Say yes to the common market, to trade and investment. Say yes to elections deciding the future direction of this country. Vote Remain.
pro	Scandinavian MEPs offer to create a Nordic trading bloc with UK Sweden Norway Denmark Finland Iceland when we Brexit. We have similar histories and cultures. Many EU countries want us to lead the way and Brexit so they can get out of the EU also. We have friends. Take heart, keep the faith, and VOTE LEAVE!
anti	Scapegoating the EU by our politicians and media was always going to come to a head at some point is was unsustainable and short sighted. However I doubt it will stop even now, people won‚Äôt learn this lesson, it‚Äôs really quite sad.

anti	Scotland leaves to join the EU
anti	Scotland leaving the UK = they are going to be on their own. UK leaving the EU = act of selfdetermination, freedom and democracy? For as long as people are able to tell lies like he does, direct decomcratic referendums are an endangerment for every society.
anti	Scotland needs another independence vote and fast. I'm so sick of being grouped together and dumped on for brexit because of some racist fucks in England.
anti	Scotland really should go independent, and look to a likely rejoining of the EU in the long term future.
anti	Scotland should go independent. Best of luck to England with Brexit but we should go our own way now
anti	Scotland twice returned a majority of anti-Brexit MPs to Westminster who voted against Brexit at every turn. Now Scotland‚Äôs out of the EU. This isn‚Äôt a union.
anti	Scotland will leave the U.K. screw borris J. See yah

anti	Seeing this mess no other EU country will dear to get out of the EU in the future. So Thank you UK
pro	Seeing this video I am more proBrexit than ever
anti	"Seems Boris wants to cosy up with the US, the most protectionist country there is by far! So the UK is whistling by their tune then, allowing low health, safety and food standards, workers rights... Is this what you meant by ""taking back control""?"
anti	"Seems Brexit happening tonight is going to be the political version of the anti-climax when people ask you on your birthday ""do you feel older/different?!?"" Nope, just same old rubbish really."
anti	Seems like a bad deal to me. We should just stay in.
anti	Seems like a good example of why not to inject major direct democracy elements into a representative system
anti	Seems like there should be a re-vote.
pro	Seems that when Mandelson said¬†the Blair and Brown governments deliberately engineered mass immigration, the former Cabinet Minister and spin doctor said New Labour sought out foreign workers.¬†it was ok to hand out top down governance because the Working Classes didn't matter in the great Labour scheme to impose diversity on the UK, without a referendum I might add.
pro	Seems the EU is really showing their fear and their contempt for democracy.
pro	"Self determination is a major reason. The EU went WAY too far when they started to tell EU member countries how many immigrants/refugees they had to take in to become citizens of their countries. Trade is one thing, who is going to be a citizen of YOUR country is quite another. The ""masters"" in Brussels lost the plot and got too comfortable with their power. The UK didn't like the rules they were required to play under so they took their ball and went home because that was the best course of action for them."
pro	Self government is a great thing.
anti	Self inflicted harm for sure due to too much self confidence arrogance and egotism of the english politicians.
anti	Self-centred, narrow-minded, xenophobic liars have won.
anti	Selfish anti democratic Brits, only interested in themselves.
pro	Send all foreign invaders who are of no use to us home.
anti	Send for the men in white coats! #LiarJohnson #ToryBrexit
anti	Sensible move, brexit Britain will destroy itself within a year.
anti	Serious question. Why are brexit voters so old, F-A-T and U-G-L-Y?
pro	Serious reply. I'm Irish, and I've lived in the UK 4 Years for work. The country, for whatever reason, gave me the ability to vote in the election. Even in Ireland, we only let irish nationals vote on things like constitution changes. But England gave me the right to vote. And there's a lot of fucking history between Ireland and England. So I used that vote to Vote Leave. Mainly because it would be hilarious! It's still hilarious. I have now gone back to Ireland.
anti	Seriously Simon? How many pro-Brexit articles have you written over the years? You're an educated man,wasn't this stuff obvious from the start?
anti	Seriously, honor and pride can't bring back good old days.
anti	"Seven privileged wealthy late middle aged white men sitting in front of a collapsing sign saying ""Global Britain."" Well that's me sold. #ERG"
anti	Shame on those who lied an cheated and stoked hatred and conned people into voting for an impossible idea that would make them poorer, cost them jobs, strip them of rights, and humiliate this country, all so that the Brexit elite and their pals could get richer. Shame on them!
anti	Shameful. The relegation of our great nation
pro	Shameless EU thieves.
anti	She got her country back? What? I don't think UK was captured by anybody. Delusional.
pro	She has lost my vote and it really is a bit late to start banging the table now.¬† ¬†All I wanted was to leave the club.
anti	She is the biggest #Brexit ier and hides behind her leopard skin shoes. See clip when she looks at Osbourne. She want to deliver by running down the clock. #InsideEurope real #theresamay
pro	She knew what she was saying. Good riddance we are out of the EU, we will be much stronger without these leeches
anti	She listened to British industry and not the table of clowns that sit around her with their degrees and no real work experience on their CVs. You voted them into power. She's doing her job. Suck it up. Brexit is the biggest waste of time and distraction this country has ever had to deal with. Millions of resources and hours diverted away from the real issues that count - Education. Health. Environment. Those who voted out should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves.
pro	She must be being paid by the EU to keep lying to the UK
pro	She told MP's 'If you want Brexit you have to vote for it'. We have already voted, and the people voted OUT, nothing to do with MP's. OUT MEANS OUT. Project fear must not win.
pro	She will not let us leave,she has lied all along.
anti	Shedding a tear tonight and keeping a candle lit in the hope UK may eventually rejoin EU.
pro	Short term some pain economically, longer term stable or growth economically. It will be nowhere near as bad as most people here want it to be.
pro	Should be a national holiday
pro	Should have left two years ago.
anti	Should have read the small print, Brexit comes with reams of it.
pro	Should of left with no deal the day after the referendum result. The less we have to do with that corrupt, undemocratic, self serving protection racket the better.
anti	Should the UK left be optimistic about our future outside the EU? No, they should stop farting around, get together and stop it happening.
anti	Should you be able to vote yes to brexit if you can't wipe your own ass...
anti	Should've changed the EU from the inside instead of leaving. You're in for a shitstorm now and it ain't gonna get better anytime soon.
pro	Shouldn't it be 'How the EU lost Britain' I mean, people only voted Brexit because the EU told David Cameron to do one when he asked for concessions. It'll be the EU that looses out in the longterm. Good luck to the EU without Britains clout.
pro	Show me a Remainiac who ISN'T,in Receipt of huge amounts of FREE EUrinal Cash for doing VERY LITTLE.....And,I'll introduce you to my Unicorn I keep in the Garden....
anti	Show me tens of millions of Brits who do not have a smart phone, or in fact any consumer electronics. Do you think iPhones were affordable if they were made in the UK?
pro	Shows why you have to fight, kick and punch the teeth out of libtards. If you do that, you can prevail!
pro	Shrink it? I don't give a toss. An economy cannot increase forever. I would have an exit from the EU, and complete withdrawal from any refugee/asylum seeker/economic migrant acceptance quotas.
pro	Shup up Crisp.....the EU has just referred to Gibraltar as a 'Colony' you idiot. They are not friends they are in fact the enemy. The same enemy that we fought two world wars against..this is war in just another guise. So get your head out of your backside and start contributing to the safety of our island you clown.
pro	Sick of it myself. The irony is that Brexit will ensure the UK, as a distinctive, independent entity, isn't destroyed and also that we will become more capable as we're forced to stand on our own two feet and confront the world as a truly soverign nation.
pro	Sigh they are getting desperate in their anti-brexit proaganda. Role on 29th March, no deal, no problem, no delay, no surrender.
anti	Sigh. why my 401K gotta suffer cuz the UK don't want immigrants? Never mind a #Brexit it's gonna be an #Amexit if we don't vote right .
pro	Sign her up to the communist party. Clearly doesn't believe in democracy
pro	Sign this confession or we will torture you. Frightening stuff, but nothing less than was to be expected from the bully-boy EU.
pro	Silly Eurocrats believed that more rules and regulations 'make life better', but the only thing that comes from more laws is more 'law breakers'.  So glad Britain has finally left that stupid EU! I am looking forward to normal lightbulbs again, no VAT on electricity and gas that will result in lower energy bills, and the ability of people in the UK to decide on what rules if any, we want. Time to build a massive bonfire outside 10 Downing Street and throw all the volumes of books that contain all the silly EU rules and burn them!
anti	Silver lining, ten years down the line might be a vote to rejoin
anti	Similarly opinion polls have shown that the majority of people no longer support leaving
pro	Simple answer to that question,WE WANT OUR COUNTRY BACK. and screw brussels.
pro	Simple fact None of this would've happened if the EU wasn't run by people with a desire for a superstate/federalism If the EU had shown it's open to genuine reform away from ever closer political & monetary union as even G Soros says they should We wouldn't have voted Leave
anti	Simple solution:stay on European Union!
pro	Simple, don't feed the gimmigrants and asylum suckers and there will be more edibles left for us! If you don't speak proper English, no food for you!
anti	Simple. Do what we did before we joined the EU. What do you think we should spend the extra ¬£165 million a week on that we will have when we leave?
pro	Simply Superb . Thank you for being so strong Prime Minister . The United Kingdom needs you Encourage Southern Ireland to join us by leaving the EU `Block `. link arms and become the political British Isles again . Sorry Brussels .. Check Mate .
pro	Simply leaving the EU means Brexit was successful. Mission accomplished.
anti	Since 1973 when the UK joined the (then) EEC not one prime minister of either party has recommended leaving the EU. Is that because they were all traitors? Is it that they knew the impact on UK economically, socially and internationally?
anti	Since 2012 there has not been a single remain supporting MEP on Question Time. That‚Äôs a clear pro Brexit bias by the BBC
pro	Since Poland and the other eastern European nations joined the EU in 2004, migrants have used the Union‚Äôs free labour movement rules to flood the UK.
anti	Since when did Brexit supporters pay any attention to experts?
anti	Since when did brexiteers think about the economy? This is all about, following their xenephobic fantasies and building a hard Irish border so we can return to 70s and 80s with IRA car bombs.
anti	Sitting back from the safety of anywhere but Britain and enjoying the show as the brexit ship collides with its final iceberg
anti	Slow Motion Suicide..
anti	Slowly but surely¬†English is losing importance in Europe
anti	Small companies (like ArtReview), and freelancers (like our writers), benefit from the EU #StrongerIn.
pro	Smash the EU
anti	Smoking doesn't cause cancer. Fast food doesn't cause obesity. CO2 doesn't cause Climate change. Brexit dooesn't cause job losses. It's the same right wing denialism, repeated over and over.
anti	Sneering contempt for people's valued freedoms and rights, thrown away to satisfy the self pitying victim fixation of poorly educated saps at the behest of disaster capitalists and the Etonian elite is the real problem facing post Brexit Britain.
pro	So #Ivotedleave because I believe Britain should return to being a self-governing democracy and will be much better for it.
anti	So @Keir_Starmerwhat would you like the argument to move on to? @jessphillipshas been very clear that our country is better off in the EU & will hold Johnson to account. As a #Remainer I'm not bowing to Johnsons wish that we now just unite & accept Brexit...
anti	So Brexit day has finally come. It's a sad day for many, myself included. I still hope my country can find its way back, I don't know how long it'll take or how hard things will get, but I (and many others) will never give up on EU.
anti	So Brexit was about opening doors to people from common wealth LOL
anti	So Brexshitters playing bingo with 66 million people's faith on the stake? Interesting. Why don't they just go out the streets and shoot random people. That would be less harmful than brexit.
anti	So Britain died today because of the English. Who are now officially the most hated people on earth. I'm going to spend the next few years sitting by my pool in my luxury villa in Spain laughing while England burns. You've made your bed of nails now you can lay in it - you absolute mugs. I'm looking forward to becoming Scottish and I'm now supporting Iceland in the Euros. The English are the scum of the earth.
anti	So British people hate immigration enough to leave the Eu but Donald Trump is looked down upon by British politicians for saying that he inflict a temporary ban on a nations people who have attacked the US? And show strong resentment towards the US?
anti	So Bye, Bye made the Globalist cry
pro	So Germany resisting backstop changes. This is one of the reasons I voted ‚ÄòLeave‚Äô. The EU is not a partnership of equals but a club run by Germany for their benefit. Germany sets the agenda and is behind all the key decisions. Everyone else is left to feed on scraps. Yes, Macron is trying to muscle in and make it a Franco-German club as it used to be in the days of the Common Market but he‚Äôll soon be pushed to one side.
pro	So Germany successfully conquered Europe after all.. just more than 50 years later after WW2 and without the use of weapons
anti	So Great-Britain is basically acting like an entitled mom. GOT IT!
pro	So I gather they think it‚Äôs game over. The Bremainers think they have bombed us into submission. They think that we have just seen the turning point in the referendum campaign, and that the British people are so intimidated by these testimonials ‚Äì American presidents, business leaders, fat cats of every description ‚Äì that they now believe the British people will file meekly to the polls in two months time and consent to stay in the EU; and thereby to the slow and insidious erosion of democracy in this country. If that is indeed the view of the Remain campaign, they are crowing too soon. They are perhaps ignoring the resilience and thoughtfulness of many middle-of-the-roaders. One senior public servant ‚Äì a man of no political party, and who had previously been on the fence ‚Äì texted me after the US intervention and said he had been so outraged at President Obama‚Äôs ‚Äúback of the queue‚Äù remark that he had instantly decided to vote Leave. But let us suppose that the Bremainers are right in their complacency. Let‚Äôs imagine that we all wake up on June 24, and discover that the people have indeed been so cowed and so perplexed by the scare stories that they voted to Remain. What then? There will be instant jubilation in Brussels, of course; champagne corks going off like Tchaikovsky‚Äôs 1812 overture. Among the vast clerisy of lobbyists and corporate affairs gurus ‚Äì all the thousands of Davos men and women who have their jaws firmly clamped around the euro-teat ‚Äì there will be relief. Things will go on as they are; indeed, things will go into overdrive. For more than a year now, Brussels has been in a self-imposed lockdown. Nothing must be done to frighten the children. The British referendum ‚Äì that embarrassing and tedious genuflection to democracy ‚Äì must be safely won; and then they will get their plans out of the drawer and get on with the business of building a federal superstate. You may have noticed, however, that the euro crisis is far from over, and that the EU remains a gigantic engine of job destruction. Eight years after the disaster began, it is obvious that the problem is structural, not cyclical. In Spain, Portugal and Greece, a whole generation of young people has been sacrificed to the Moloch of the euro ‚Äì and they are still on the dole. The Greeks are unable to pay their debts; the Italian banks have a ‚Ç¨360 billion black hole. In response, the EU plans ‚Äúmore Europe‚Äù, a fiscal and political union, in which Britain would inevitably be involved. Remember we were told we wouldn‚Äôt have to pay for the Greek bail-outs? And then we did? According to the European Commission‚Äôs Five Presidents‚Äô Report, which lays out plans to shore up the euro, the Commission wants to have a new European approach to company law, to property rights, to every aspect of employment law. Why? Because if the Germans are to be persuaded to engage in a perpetual bankrolling of the less prosperous regions of the EU, then they want proper Germanic rules to enforce good behaviour. He who pays the piper calls the tune. And Brussels can see only one way to save the euro ‚Äì and that is to get Germany to pay, and therefore to allow Germany to call the tune. Remember that twice in the last five years, the EU has removed a democratically elected government ‚Äì in Italy and Greece ‚Äì and installed Brussels-approved technocrats. It is a narcotic tyranny. They want to go on with the work of building a unitary state, in a way that is anti-democratic and ultimately very dangerous, since it will one day provoke real public anger. Britain should not be involved in any of this ‚Äì and yet we have absurdly and inexcusably given up our veto rights; and the whole process is going to be conducted within the ‚Äúsingle market‚Äù ‚Äì that is, the existing EU structures ‚Äì so that we are morally and legally comprised, and share all the ensuing political and economic damage. Inch by inch, month by month, the sausage machine of EU law-making will extrude more laws ‚Äì at a rate of 2,500 a year, or perhaps even faster, once the referendum is out of the way. More and more people will exercise their unfettered rights to come to this country, putting more pressure on our public services. And eventually ‚Äì when we are unable to take it any more ‚Äì the UK will utter a faint sheepish cough of protest. Please sir, we will say, raising our hand in the EU Council, we need reform. And eyebrows will shoot up in a Batemanesque way. REFORM? they will say, in the tones of Lady Bracknell. REFORM? But you just had reform‚Ä¶ If there is one thing that proves the folly of remaining in the EU ‚Äì in the hope that we can change things from within ‚Äì it is the tragic poverty of that deal. The Prime Minister asked to restore social and employment legislation to national control; for a complete opt-out from the Charter of Fundamental rights; to stop the European court adjudicating on UK criminal law; to ensure that immigrants have a job offer before entering the UK; to revise the Working Time directive to protect the NHS; to reform the Common Agricultural Policy and the structural funds; and full-on Treaty change. What did we get? Two thirds of diddly squat. We need to talk about that deal in the weeks ahead, because it shows how contemptuously we will be treated if we vote to remain. This is the last chance, in our lifetimes, to take back control ‚Äì of ¬£350m a week (and use some of that cash to deliver a seven-day NHS) ‚Äì and the last chance to take back control of our democracy. Of course the elites want to remain. They will always have power. The losers are the hundreds of millions of Europeans whose only power is their vote ‚Äì their ability to sack their governments at elections. That power is being taken away. It is indefensible, and it will lead to real trouble. We can be stronger, richer, more influential if we vote Leave. In believing that we can all be scared into thinking otherwise, the Remainers are fatally underestimating the British public.
anti	So I suppose a 57% rise in reported hate crime in the UK post Brexit is just a coincidence? You don't fool me trying to disguise your racist mentality with the label sovereignty.
pro	So I'm new and up until last night I wanted The UK to Remain in The EU... Today I want The UK to Leave and be an example to the EU. I am pretty young, late 20s, in an ok job in eastern England. I've lived and travelled around The UK a bit due to parents and academic pursuits. At the end of my University career I left The UK to work in North America, the difference was stark and I don't really mean culturally. There you have people active in their communities fighting for changes in the local area, usually with results - be it town/city/countywide. A strong sense of national identity and a desire to create a better world for themselves. An upfront and fair way of giving jobs to foreign nationals in lieu of a citizen, which works. Freedom to decide what they do with the money collected with taxes locally, stately/provincially or countrywide.. Doesn't that all sound great? As a young Briton, I've begun to ask myself why aren't we like that anymore? I've been told by grandparents and older colleagues of a different time... What happened? The EU happened. The EU has brought about some good things, sure. I was someone who once thought if we left The EU all those rights will be eroded away. Will it really, would we let our Government do that to us, or would we, as a once again truly independent nation, stand up for what we believe in? I know I would! We don't need anyone to decide what's best for us... We've known it all along... We knew it before we joined, we know it now and we'll know it when the time comes to take off the Blue and Gold jacket. We won't be isolated, we won't be cut off and we won't be worse off. We'll be free to do what we want, live how we want and spend how we want. I know no different from The EU, but I don't think I want to carry on in this pantomime any longer!
anti	So UK doesn't want border controls in Northern Ireland and at the same time doesn't want free movement of people. It's absolutely ridiculous! I hope these people will wake up before it's too late.
anti	So according the #Brexit there will be no more fishing quotas and the seas will suddenly fill with fish
anti	So according to some, people are weaker together. Economic prosperity is attained by having it bound to borders and delays. And war is averted if you do not co-operate with your neighbors by putting up restrictions. It's the inverse of what history should've thought us. But it seems yet again, people will never learn.
anti	So after being turned down for citizenship on grounds of insufficient evidence of integration into life in the uk (teacher & headteacher for 14 years) now my application for settled status can‚Äôt go through. 3 attempts and each time the website crashes!
anti	So areas that had most recent migration were more inclined to vote remain, and areas most reliant on inward EU investment voted to leave. Funny old world.
anti	So as someone who lives in the U.S. I see this like if Texas for example seceded from the Union. They can no longer travel to Louisiana or anywhere else in the U.S. Without a visa and its messes up who trading and stuff like that goes. I get that this is on a much much bigger scale, but am I close?
anti	So ashamed to be British right now
anti	So basically all hell will break loose in 2020.
anti	So brexit was a bad idea
anti	So despite all the evidence of how badly any sort of brexit will affect the UK a large number of citizens still want to make us all poorer. Bastards.
anti	So disappointed with how my country has conducted itself through all of this, and with Brexit in general. From togetherness, multiculturalism and inclusion to segregation, xenophobia and patriotism. Bye EU, I hope to see more of Europe someday.
anti	So embarrassed for my country
anti	So every moron Brexiter wants to hang the GOSH nurse because of what she said and wish cancer on this one? You're all disgusting idiots
anti	So far Brexit has been a political disaster.
anti	"So far the Brexit is just a sad story. Both the UK and the EU will just have a ""negative bill"" in the end"
anti	"So far we have only notionally ""left"" and we are already seeing the start of an economic downturn."
anti	So far, austerity, brought on by the financial crash. In the future, it will be nothing compared to what Brexit will do.
pro	So far, the only positive effect I've read about often of the EU has been the reduction of mobile roaming charges. Whoopee-do.
anti	So for my understanding in simple terms UK leaves the EU and tries to make it so they get the best advantage against everyone else in Europe (trade etc). Since the EU is a coalition they say fuck off that's not how it works. UK is now omg how could this have happened! Is that the jist of it?
anti	So for those having a party and celebrating with a bottle of bubbly from France ( Champagne) Italy (Prosecco) or Spain (Cava) bottoms up, as you will soon be finding all those things you have taken for granted evaporating - but you all knew that anyway, didn't you?
anti	So fucking angry, what have you won leavers other than subservience to the states. What have you won? I don't expect an answer.
pro	So fucking awesome. Fuck the EU and it's endless shitty regulations.
pro	So glad Britain is independent now.
pro	So glad around 50 % of the UK are still passionate about our future and yet saddened that around 50% believe Brussels are doing a good job in running europe! Vote Leave and make a stand, enough is enough
pro	So glad they voted to leave. Good job Britan
pro	So glad we voted to leave
anti	So gross to see the gamfilth taking about optimism and healing. You have divided the county with your hatred, racism and xenophobia - we will always remind you of that and never settle.
pro	So happy for English people.. They re the best of the best... I m from Italy and I made party too. I hope my people do the same. I'm tired to be a slave of German and French government.. We were so happy before this union... We didn't need to find a job overseas... Great Job England... You are inspiring.
pro	So happy for Great Britain. They have their life back!
pro	So happy for our British brothers and sisters!! Liberty Rocks!
pro	So happy to leave the anti democratic EU, huge thank you to everyone that has made it happen
pro	So happy to nearly an independent nation again. We are more than a star on someone else's flag...
anti	So in short, a lot of us who do not want this shit are going to have to pay out a lot as it is shovelled on our heads.
anti	So in short: nothing has changed. The EU and UK need to find a deal and until that happens nobody has a clue what brexit actually means.
anti	So instead of controlling our borders we could end up letting literally anyone in due to this brexit blunder?! Congratulations, Brexiteers.
pro	So is this guy supposed to be an independent expert making rational decisions based on empirical facts?? because he seems like an emotionally driven hysterical remoaner to me!!!
anti	So is this the end.....?
anti	So is this why the fast food restaurants that I go to increased there prices??
anti	So it appears Trump UK is also losing. Let's keep the momentum going and get rid of this louse along with Farage.
pro	So it‚Äôs official, the EU IS indeed the hotel California ... who on earth would want to remain a part of something that will forever have a gun to your head.
anti	So it‚Äôs okay to lie, cheat, bribe, intimidate to win an election? You would manipulate votes and suppress voter turnout to win an election, then call it legitimate?
pro	So let's grow more local food. Better all round.
pro	So lets get Britain out of the crumbling EU mess.
anti	So little gained so much lost.... you realize that while UK might gain a little money by this, most people will lose money right?
pro	So long Britain and good luck! Well deserved.
pro	So long as we leave the EU completely I'm all for it,, just Don't try to keep us in it or there will be trouble for sure,, the EU is finished and is an out dated ideology that's failed 600million people
pro	So long, and thanks for (taking) all the fish.
pro	So long, farewell, au revoir, auf wiedersehen to EU.
anti	So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, goodnight We'd like to stay, but we've been taken over by the far right ... So long, farewell, au revoir, auf wiedersehen #WeLoveEU #Brexit
pro	So looking forward to seeing the EU27 countries brought to their knees. Roll-on 31st January 2020 at 11pm GOODBYE EU üòäüá¨üáß
pro	So many EU bootlickers, let me tell you that EU was so upset about brexit and you know why? Because they lost a wallet.
anti	So many companies didn't say a word, these just moved HQ already. Almost all the banks will do so if no deal happens.
anti	So many inbred island folks in 1 video :-)
anti	So many people happy with this party going on, we will see how THE hangover will go :))
pro	So many people in this thread that are pro EU forget the fact that WE voted to leave you because the EU is a failed idea
anti	So millions of voters just potentially doomed millions of innocent immigrants. At this point in history mankind is more bad then good. That's a scary thought.
pro	So much for a democratic vote to leave the European Union. The political elite were never going to let us leave. Talk about betrayal!
pro	So much for the Remoaner lie that the UK would have to apply to join the WTO then.
anti	So much mess and confusion. Just recind article 50. We don't actually want to leave!!
pro	So much more reason in life for us now
anti	So much of the agenda behind Brexit has been murky.
pro	So nice to be in control of our own destiny.
pro	So now the EU can damage itself to destruction and the UK can move on unscathed as part of the free World.
anti	So pretty much this happened because of an ignorant, old, and outdated way of thinking. I dont get it, why didn't the young ones get out and vote against this?
anti	So pro brexit people when do you guys plan to rejoin the EU after all this nonsense is over?
pro	So proud of Britain....congratulations for your leading role in the end of globalism
pro	So proud of the British. Breaking away from the Neo-marxist globalist regime.
anti	So proud of the people from my home town who do not support leaving the EU. Europe, please leave a light on for those of us who did not want #BrexitReality #IamEuropean that will not change with #Brexit
pro	So proud of you Brits for recognizing the importance of being British. Despite what the left wants everyone to believe, I know it has nothing to do with racism and everything to do with governing yourselves and retaining your incredible history and culture. We'll be watching closely as you transition back to being you. God bless you and your country!!!!!
pro	So proud, never thought we would get there. Well done Brexiteers.
anti	So sad :(. I was really hoping something similar to the eu would spread across the world.
anti	So sad to say goodbye to our British friends. Always better together.
anti	So sad today, this is a huge mistake. Sorry Europe.
anti	So sad!! Everyone is celebrating for their own reason.But they will soon realise the mitakes!!
anti	So sick of this story. You Brits are nuts for wanting to leave the EU. Just nuts. We had more than 70 years of peace. How the hell can you even think of gambling with that? Especially in times with lunatics like Trump and Putin around. I can understand the frustration but you negotiate, you discuss to solve problems. Just leaving, or, hiding behind borders or walls is just pathetic. It won't solve any problem ever. It's childishly naive to think otherwise.
anti	So sorry for all the British people who wanted to stay in the EU, it must be a miserable feeling tonight. As for the brexiteers.. don't let the door hit you on the way out! A very confused comment I know, but it's how I feel
anti	So that's it; it's all over. I'm now no longer a citizen of the EU; I'm now just a resident of a small isolated island in the middle of the sea and I couldn't be more sad
anti	So the EU has more to lose than a No Deal prepared UK. If our government are unable to negotiate a good deal with the EU in two years and with all the parliamentary infighting going on, I very much doubt that our government is able to be fully prepared for a No Deal exit by the end of March
pro	So the EU now has the authority to install hard borders in other nations? (The EU decides whether ireland puts up a border or not?)
pro	So the EU position is to try and make ex members follow its standards? Wasn't this kind of meddling what caused the whole mess in the first place.
anti	So the UK goes from being a second rate power but part of a very important European Union, to being isolated and totally irrelevant in the modern word. But frankly, my dear, who cares!
pro	So the UK is sending 8.5 bil to the EU every year. Okay, good reason enough to leave it, end of discussion.
anti	So the UK went from the 'sick man of Europe' to a very dynamic economy and has since the vote gone back to the sick man.... I would say the solution would be to stay in the EU.
anti	So the fascists have won their coup in the UK, Farage and co. have got what they wanted
anti	"So the idiots in Westminster spend a whole day discussing and voting in favour of something that the EU are quite clear is unacceptable. All this time wasting while the clock ticks inexorably towards March 29th. The incompetence of this ""strong and stable"" government is incomprehensible. The best Brexit is no Brexit at all."
pro	So the most voted for thing in British history should be halted? And that's not a war against democracy?
anti	So the workers knew what they did when they voted leave and are ok with being laid off because of Brexit? Brilliant, the turkey voted for Christmas. Bizarre. They deserve to feel the steel of Brexit.
pro	So they clap when it is mentioned the deal will not be renegotiated...Well clap a lot louder when we leave with no deal on the 29th March...Our clapping here in the UK will be heard over the waters and the fireworks here in the UK will light up the European skies. Bye Bye EU you set of theives, liars and dictators.
pro	So they pledge to subvert a legal and democratic vote because they don't like it. Authoritarians come in many political flavors.
anti	So this basically means we're in all sorts of trouble. We have a PM using words like 'superhero' so that thick people can actually believe him. In modern Britain it is astonishing that people can be manipulated in this way.
anti	So to get this right: Rich people will be able to migrate freely, but us normal people won't?
anti	So today is Brexit day it is also my birthday so thanks for the birthday present you right wing fascist wankers
anti	So very tired of listening to pig-ignorant people talking pure bilge. They have absorbed the lies like sponges and do not attempt to seek truth. To add insult to injury, these are the folk that have decided our future. I could not be more filled with angst and anger.
anti	So we are now officially prisoners on Brexshit Island. Thankfully there are no fireworks to rub it in and make the pain worse. A very sad day indeed.
pro	So we have to do what the EU tells us, but the EU ignores anything we tell them. Just like old times really, which is why we are where we are.
pro	So we lose a few quid and gain our sovereign control. Seems like a small price to pay to me.
pro	So we should and vice versa, we are still part of Europe just not part of the failing union. Sooner we are shot of those bullies the better
anti	So we'll be exposed to predatory monopolies, our market is going to be flooded with cheap products subsidised by foreign governments and we're going to scrap social protection and environmental standards. Yippee.
anti	So weird , it‚Äôs like everything is topsy turvy with people actually celebrating leaving a union that brings countries closer together
pro	So what's the problem? WTO is a deal. 29 March is getting closer, great!
pro	So what‚Äôs the point of carrying this fiasco on leave. Spend the time teaching the MPs how to pass laws and look after our Country for a change. They are obviously so used to being told what to do by the EU its going to take a bit of time for them to know what to do.
anti	So what‚Äôs whole point of leaving the EU if they have a lot of negotiation to do.
anti	So when the British economy falls after March 29, 2019, will the Brexshiteers admit that Brexit is a mistake? Or are they going to blame brown people, the EU and George Soros for it?
anti	So when will we start to reap the benefits of brexit? When will I earn more money? when will the things my taxes go towards be ran better? when will the NHS be funded effectively? Or is it just a new passport? and the opportunity to overfish the channel?
pro	So where‚Äôs everyone from?? And who will be attending any of the #probrexit rally‚Äôs in the lead up to and possibly after we should have left? Im contemplating Boston (where I used to live & the largest VOTE #LEAVE in uk) or travelling to London on 2nd Nov if we haven‚Äôt left.
pro	So why should the UK as the worlds fifth largest economy be forced into freedom of movement, regulatory alignment, or fishery access?
anti	So yea, we voted leave now where's that ¬£350 Million/week for the NHS? Nowhere... The NHS is crumbling
anti	So you think this is about Merkel?? Nobody cares about Merkel here. She may be the greatest administrator the world has ever seen, but that has nothing to do with the Brexit debate
anti	So you voted to destroy the lives of countless millions and you expect us to site silently by and allow you to do it. Sorry love that is not going to happen. We will fight this insanity with everything we have
anti	So you want to stay in the single market, stop immigration, fuck with the good Friday agreement, annnd not have to pay in for any of it? Yea... Totally a normal fair deal, and it's definitely the EU being unreasonable, not you being delusional.
pro	So your backing a EU army, Germany and France today have moved close to this, we want a peaceful life open to the world not tired up in little EU
pro	So, Remainers, when do the drugs run out?
anti	So, asking as an outsider, which policies were actually imposed onto Britain by EU with which people disagreed?
anti	So, challenge of the day to our Brexiter friends. Give us an example of how the EU‚Äôs lack of democracy has disadvantaged the UK.
anti	So, have fun being a vassal of the U.S.
pro	So, it's all conjecture; all 'maybes' 'shoulds' and 'coulds'. No deal means we won't have an economic deal with the EU until we make one after March, that's not bad. Explain how, if it is!
anti	"So, just in the last 2 days he bans his aids from saying ""No deal"", tries to avoid any scrutiny from the press, and now he has a code for No Deal in order to discombobulate the masses again into thinking it‚Äôs not the dreaded ""no deal"" which would do trade no end of harm. What a lying deceitful charlatan winker"
anti	So, now that you can get rid of some of those pesky laws, who do you think will get to pick, the people or corporations? It won't be long before trickle down economics gets introduced. Good luck with that. When things get worse you'll see your first commercial prisons appear. Sounds familiar? Any society that 'hardens up' goes down a spiral of self destruction.
pro	So, now the UK has the per capita GDP of Norway and the industrial power of China.
anti	So, poorer Brexiters voted to be worse off? There‚Äôs nothing wrong in that
anti	So, rest assured--all of this Brexit crap is part of a grand strategy to destabilize and weaken Europe, the UK and the US and prop up North Korea, China and other anti-democratic nations around the world.
anti	So, we left the EU just 4 days ago and it's all falling apart. Promises made are being broken. Lies are being told. The fishermen, farmers, car manufacturers and UK businesses are being sold down the river. We don't need a deal they say. What a bunch of charlatans! #ToryBrexit
anti	So, who wants to take bets on how long before Britain tries for re-admission back into the EU?
anti	So, with Boris commanding Parliament, with nobody left to blame the situation he finds himself in, he cannot even muster a trade deal equivalent to Canada.
pro	So, you really don't believe there are any reasons for leave? Why?
anti	So, you say that Britain lost security and stability with Brexit. I am not sure that this is an opportunity for them It is not natural that Britain is not a part of European Union. This is just an attempt of showing the power.
pro	"So,how many times do you have to vote to LEAVE the hated EU?2 or 4 or 8 or 10 times?Just how many?You""Remoaners"" along with""Traitor May"" and the""BureaucRATS""in Brussels,have had 2 years to finalize this.The PEOPLE of the UK voted to LEAVE and LEAVE they should."
pro	"So,how many times do you have to vote to LEAVE the hated EU?2 or 4 or 8 or 10 times?Just how many?You""Remoaners"" along with""Traitor May"" and the""BureaucRATS""in Brussels,have had 2 years to finalize this.The PEOPLE of the UK voted to LEAVE and LEAVE they should.The only other alternative is follow the French and your own version of""Les Gilets Jaunes"""
anti	"So. Vote leave have just complained about the EU building ""bridges to nowhere "" in ""places like Scotland""¬†. Well mate that ""nowhere"" is my home. Lost my vote on one. Bye !"
pro	Soft Brexit is for the liberal snowflake who needs the government to tell them what to think in their safe spaces.
anti	Soft Brexit, Hard Brexit, Massive pile of S---. Sloppy Brexit, Messy Brexit, Quit, Quit, Quit.
pro	Solidarity and opportunities. If you are a Geman/French bank, sure. If not, revenge and economic war.
anti	Some Leave voters had voiced the opinion that they had only voted Leave to give the government a good kicking and they wished they had the opportunity to change their vote
anti	Some Uk Businesses are freaking out that there is a No Deal Brexit with EU
anti	Some idiots are talking about leave.I swear they don't even know what European union is.They've no idea how imp is to remain in.#VoteRemain
anti	Some lessons have to be learned through pain
anti	Some of these brexiteers are simply ignorant.
anti	Some of these brexiteers are simply ignorant. I was 17 during the referendum, therefore I could not vote. I am greatly effected by brexit. These pensioners had an infinitely louder voice in the referendum than me. The pensioners will hardly be around to even see the effects... thanks Cameron for ‚Äòthe greatest democratic process in British history‚Äô.
anti	Some of us know who exploits us already. It isn't the EU.
pro	Some of us remember life before the EU. We need to get out of it and stay out of it.
pro	Some of you have lost the plot. We are still european. We dont need to be part of the EU project to be European.
anti	Some people NEED to learn the hard way to eventually learn anything.
pro	Some people are so retarted. This is great for Britain. Sure their economy is not great but it was already bad. Their economy will be great in the future as well. They also will not allow any Muslims into the country which was the main reason people voted to leave. A revolution is happening in the world and it has started in Britain. America will be next when we elect Trump as our next President!
anti	"Some people have been selling unicorns and fairy tales for 20 years. They have been telling people that all tough choices were made ""Because Brussels told us so"". So pretty much using it as the perfect scapegoat, even on matters where Brussels has nothing to say. For many, this was the ideal life as a politician, you can be popular, cause all the bad things happen, not because of me, but big bad EU... If I was in full control, I'd give you unicorns. But oh well, meanwhile I will fight for you with big angry Brussels. A position they could do up til now. My personal opinion is that they didn't want to win the referendum themselves. They just wanted a close remain vote, so they knew they were popular, but they didn't want to kill their perfect scapegoat. They certainly knew they couldn't produce any unicorns, which is why the second the campaign is over, they all ran away into obscurity, cause for sure they didn't want to show the people they lied to for years that actually the EU isn't all bad (not perfect). May is only doing what she could be doing. ANY deal that the EU is willing to make is worse than what they have. Read any of the Gym membership analogies... you cannot have club benefits from the EU without contribution. No deal is a leap in the abyss... You relied on central agencies and trade ties which were build up in the last 30 years, you cannot even begin to untangle them in 2 yrs, it will take decades. No Brexit is the only sane option, I think even the Boris and Nigels are hoping for at this point. If they remain, economically it would be the best solution for the UK, and they will become very popular again with all the people who voted leave and still think May didn't deliver the unicorns that these guys still claim exist."
anti	Some people i know,(who i thought should know better) are going to vote Leave. Which makes me think,shit ,they really are more stupid ,than i thought.
pro	Some people say that Reddit isn't all that liberal, but look at all the top comments and you'll see that it is overwhelmingly so. Also i will be voting to leave.
pro	Some very uniformed opinions here ! I voted leave, like many others because the EU is nothing more than a self serving lefty club, very much as the GLC was for London. The final straw for many was merkel telling us, in no uncertain terms, that we were barred from attempting to stop their Kalergi Plan for all of Europe. Now is the time for all European nations to keep together to fight this abomination, the EU is anti European, if you doubt this look at their actions over the 10 years or so.......
anti	Somebody please save Britain from this cacophony of gross incompetence that Brexit is.
anti	Someone cut me up today and they had a Vote Leave sticker on their car. Coincidence? I think not
anti	"Someone said in this stream this morning that the leave voters are dying off, the Tory voters are dying off, and Brexit is dying off. I‚Äôm ashamed to admit that the first thing that went through my mind on reading this was ""good, good, good""."
anti	Something I've learnt through this whole awful process is that I feel more European than British. We'll be back.
anti	"Something for all you brexiteers to remember, one of the greatest Prime Ministers this country ever had, Winston Churchill, called for a ""United States of Europe"" and while that is by no means what the EU is it was better than anything we have ever had before. Enjoy your special 50p Coins while you can, our currency is about to tank and become all but useless buying anything from abroad."
pro	Something that I think it should be mentioned is the EU pushing the Euro, something the UK WILL HAVE TO ADOBT sooner or later should they stay in the EU. Note that the Euro is weaker than the Pound.
pro	Something truly remarkable is going to happen.
anti	Sometimes I wonder what bullshit UKIP is even feeding you Anglos for you to actually believe leaving is a great idea in the first place.
anti	Sometimes an entire country, an entire people can make a mistake. This one from the British people is one of the dumbest actions in the history of humankind. There is absolutely no rational reason why those Brits did something like this. Perhaps this or that need had to be satisfied. But the bad far, way too far, outweigh the benifts. Still smh. Incredible.
pro	Sometimes in life you need to take a risk.
anti	Sometimes quitting may not be as easy as one thinks!
pro	Sometimes these EU rules sound simply ludicrous, like the rule that you can‚Äôt recycle a teabag, or that children under eight cannot blow up balloons, or the limits on the power of vacuum cleaners. Sometimes they can be truly infuriating ‚Äì like the time I discovered, in 2013, that there was nothing we could do to bring in better-designed cab windows for trucks, to stop cyclists being crushed. It had to be done at a European level, and the French were opposed.
pro	Sometimes voting makes little difference to who governs you and how they do it. Vote Remain on Thursday and it NEVER will. #VoteLeave
anti	Soo many brexiteers out there, their minds need convincing/changing too..
anti	Soon Britain won't even be a kingdom.
anti	Soon Brits will see EU is not a cause of their problems.
anti	Soon Brits will see EU is not a cause of there problems.
pro	Soon the EU will collapse just like the USSR.
anti	Soon, people who voted for BREXIT will realize how much more difficult they have made it for themselves and others.
pro	Soon, very soon, they will be so glad they have left. All of them.
anti	Sooner or later, they'll realize that they have set themselves in a dead-end...
anti	Sorry I couldn't hear you over the sound of Britain crashing and burning.
pro	Sorry I support the Brexit as I want to be ruled and governed by our own government and police force and not have a shadow government and police ruled by another nation as it is at moment. I also value the lives that was lost in WW1 and WW2 and will not disrespect them by letting those who they gave their lives for rule us. if you want to stay in Europe then may I suggest you move there and leave this country to the ones that want to make it work when we leave.
pro	Sorry John Oliver, UK voted to leave.
pro	Sorry about your personal problem, but I don't want to live in the USSR with better tailoring. The EU is a corrupt club for failed politicians. It is evil and soul destroying. I say this from an ex-communist state.The EU is the wrong road forever
anti	Sorry but brexit is the worst idea anyone has ever had and if you've you voted for brexit then your claped
pro	Sorry but most people's opinions in the UK is to leave most just want a hard Brexit
pro	Sorry but there are two things that cannot be¬† changed in all of this and that is....The will of the people to leave the EU and the fact that Parliament is Sovereign...
anti	Sorry for all my British friends today. I hope you‚Äôll soon return too our flawed, but still quite okay European Union. Wish you best of luck in the coming months.
anti	Sorry kids. You've been lied to by the LEAVEs. This is the way the rich elite and powerful keep the 'quiet ones' in line. The elite and rich who own papers like the DM have spun stories and spouted rhetoric that 'independence' is going to benefit you. But by leaving we give the elite more control and making them richer. We working classes will be worse off. Despite what they tell us. Immigrants pay more in tax than they claim. It's the rich and 'austerity' who are keeping it. Not people who are coming to our country because we voted to bomb them back in December. Wake up to the lies.
anti	Sorry that the shitty bigots took over your country
pro	Sorry, 52% of 'the people's vote' Voted to Brexit.
pro	Sorry, no. I don‚Äôt want to give a single penny of taxpayer money to the EU whilst we have people here, living like this, tonight. If that means some of you have to forego a lettuce, get over it. Have to queue at Dover? Get over it. Lose phone roaming? Get over it. #brexitmeansbrexit
anti	Sorry, the people did not vote for Boris Trump. He didn't get a majority of the votes.
pro	Sorry, were you living here when we were an Independent Nation, trading with centuries old trading partners and living under our own laws and customs!!!!
pro	Sorting the wheat from the chaff, get on with it. The moaners are holding us back, 56 days and OUT. Do it.
pro	Sounds about right for the EU. Talking a load of crap.
pro	Sounds like Channel 4 don't like the result of Brexit because they will lose the large amounts of money from the EU.
pro	Sovereignity, less unwanted immigration, not as many ridiculous laws, private deals and not having to pay the EU a membership fee.
pro	Sovereignty is the only argument necessary
pro	Sovereignty!!!!! Before alleged wealth. Good for Britain!
pro	Speaking as a Brexiter, if trade was the sole prism through which to view #Brexit, then from a GDP perspective there isn't a good reason to leave the EU. Let's stop pretending otherwise. Brexit is more than mere accountancy.
pro	Speaks the champagne socialist of inner London
pro	Specific examples would be the common agricultural policy which has seen food prices go up since we joined the EU in 1977 and honestly it has never gone back down.
anti	Spot on. It will be a disasterous no deal Brexit come January next year if the UK government doesn't wake up to reality. The size of their majority will count for nothing when food and medicine shortages meet mass redundancies and petrol shortages. The run on the pound will only make taking on the euro seem so much more sensible when whoever's in charge finally asks the EU for readmittance.
anti	Stand back and enjoy the shitshow. Then lob a few hand grenades in here and there just to make yourself feel better. You're welcome.
pro	Stand up for Brexit ...I know I am .... are you?
pro	Stand up for Brexit!
pro	Stand up for complete LEAVE Jacob, no place for compromise, we have to leave before the evil Lisbon treaty is implemented as it would doom Britain to being a vassal state of the eu forever !!!! People, look it up and see the danger we are in !!!! No postponing article50 ,get us OUT NOW !!!!
pro	Start as you mean to go on, time to take control back from the EU, what is the point in leaving if they still tell us what they think should happen, the reality has not yet got through to Brussels we stopped being a member of your very expensive boys club on Friday last
anti	Start the petition to change the name from Great Britain to Little England.
anti	Stay as always
anti	Stay in EU . Without EU wildlife and environmental laws the Conservatives would destroy everything that I love.
anti	Stay in EU, then join human kind for the sake of the solutions of globalization.
anti	Stay in European Union UK .
anti	"Stay in because I value freedom of travel and work higher than a very minute risk of terrorism and POSSIBLE net econonomic loss. I've been alive a long time and never had trouble with a ""foreigner"" as far as I can anecdotally tell most act on best behaviour until they integrate properly."
anti	Stay in but needs change
pro	Stay in the world, leave EU restrictions
anti	Stay stay stay!
pro	Stay strong UK!! Stay strong. Long live Democracy!!
pro	Stay strong and don't forget to bring the pitchforks on Thursday. The people of Britain are slow to anger but enough is enough. We need change. Vote OUT !
pro	Stay strong, You'll be free of the tyrannical EU soon enough.
anti	Stay with the EU for the love of god. So much bad will come from leaving.
anti	Stay, better for people, economy & environment
anti	Staying In. Because I trust the EU Commission a lot more than I trust the Tory government. They would rip up any bank regulation within a week and see our consumer and worker rights fed to the wolves on a plate
pro	Staying in EU is not an option.
anti	Staying in the Customs Union is effective full membership of the EU. So fantastic - Brexit is cancelled. Brexiteers will go absolutely ape when they find out about this, but it will be fun watching them chasing their own tail.
anti	Staying in the EU is clearly the most sensible thing to do.
pro	Staying in the EU would very likely lead to a long-term brain drain from the UK as non-EU graduates are treated as cash cows for the years of education they seek in the UK
anti	Staying is the best possible deal we'll get
anti	Stepping out of the EU is a step back in the reality of poverty. British fools.
anti	"Stereotypical Brexiter, ""I don't want to explain just blindly believe me when I tell you what the truth is""."
pro	Stick to your guns, Boris! The majority of us are behind you
pro	Stick ya offer of a new partnership. Let's get t f out of there while the going is good. Who wants to deal with that bunch of criminals anyway
pro	Stiff upper lip Brits. At least you have your dignity and sovereignty. Things will bounce back. I get the feeling sometime soon after our own election.
anti	Still European, always European # Brexit
anti	Still Leavers get another 11 months where they can pretend that leaving is the same as staying but with nice blue passports and shiny new 50p pieces.
anti	Still Zero plan or details on how they - and Northern Ireland - will trade with the EU, police immigration, etc. In effect, they've now actually jumped out of a plane without a parachute, with Boris saying he's confident that there'll be a solution to the issue before an undesirable cranial matter-ground interface with the rapidly approaching terra firma. All while that shifty fucker Farage dances around on the sidelines. Great.
anti	Still don‚Äôt understand why the wanted to leave the EU
pro	Still glad I voted to leave. I wouldn't surrender the sovereignty of my country for anything. Those who want to overturn a democratic vote disgust me and make me more of an ardent Brexiteer as a result.
anti	Still gutted to be isolating ourselves from countries where you don‚Äôt have to pay in a bar ‚Äòtil you leave AND you get tasty snacks for free.
pro	Still have to laugh at the the tedious and odious remoaners on here who think they can reverse Brexit. You tried all the underhanded tactics you could and failed. You can burn your EU flags , as you won't be needing them again.
anti	Still hoping that this is actually a nightmare and I will wake up any minute now üò•
anti	Still no plan. The people who negotiated the deal from the government and who said this is the only way are now saying we can change it. Yet still don't know what to change it to. Brexiters are incredible....not in a good way
anti	Still not heard one tangable benefit of us leaving. And I see that ' experts' are back in fashion again. It's all one big fat Tory con
anti	Still nothing solved.
pro	Still pro-leave; for me principle trumps my own economic interests
pro	Still pro-leave; for me principle trumps my own economic interests. I'm hoping for economic integration and maybe a resumption of the free movement of people. But I don't want the UK to have anything to do with the EU's political structure.
pro	Still very optimistic about Brexit.
anti	Still waiting for the Brexit plan from the Brexiters. Do we still hold all the cards, in this game of chess?
anti	"Still waiting to hear what the actual benefits are of leaving the EU. No one has actually managed to give any yet, all I seem to hear is some rhetoric, annecdotes and made up facts like ""we get our government back from Germany"" and other hilariously stupid comments"
anti	"Still waiting to hear what the actual benefits are of leaving the EU. No one has actually managed to give any yet, all I seem to hear is some rhetoric, annecdotes and made up facts like ""we get our government back from Germany"" and other hilariously stupid comments."
pro	Still want to be part of the EU? This is our chance to break free and set our our rules and recapture of entrepreneurship. Come on! #GoBrexit
anti	Stoopid Little England government has been dictating to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland for years. We get it, you're the biggest and we accept you pay the lion's share of the bill. Sadly, that is not the case with Europe. Little England and its tax avoidance and paradise papers MPs who want to dictate are up againsy 27, yes T W E N T Y - S E V E N other countries. In the words of Rocky IV 'You will lose' and to think Theresa May, the weakest prime minister for years will cherry pick her way out of her own party's Brexit mess is pure fantasy. Dream on English Tory government, you will soon realise the empire and WW2 are long ago and the world is moving on without you. You shall dictate no more.
anti	Stop Brexit - Leavers and Remainers unite against the political class and the lies in their party manifestos and referendum nonsense.
anti	Stop Brexit Save Britain
anti	Stop Brexit and the destruction of your country and you'll get your holidays back MPs.
anti	Stop Brexit from happen! We would only suffer....
anti	Stop Brexit..
anti	Stop Brexit: rescind article 50 now
anti	Stop Brexit‚Ä¶Fight Racism
pro	Stop all those bloody German cars coming in & Republic of Ireland/EU lorries using the UK as a toll free land bridge clogging up the transport system to ease the logistics till everyone grows up.
anti	Stop being stupid! Abandon Brexit! Abandon insanity!
anti	Stop blaming the EU. You were a club member, ate lunch and now want to leave without paying.
anti	Stop brexit !!!!
anti	Stop dreaming and face the reality: your country will be poorer
pro	Stop giving the eu money , that should do it , scrap the HOP and create a BREXIT govt
anti	Stop it!
pro	Stop listening to the remain bias media and await the positives that will come from Brexit,just remember there will be 40 billion every year to ease any problems that will arise.
pro	Stop messing about and get us out
pro	Stop so many migrants coming in
anti	Stop talking about how great you are, how great this is for Britain and how horrible the E.U. is. Just clear out your desk and go. We will figure out the rest at our leisure after you are gone. Then, after maybe 5 years or so and the dust has settled, we will see how things have worked out for you. And we WILL be listening to this speech of yours again to see how right or wrong you were.
pro	Stop talking, we want hard brexit now!
anti	Stop this Brexit nonsense
anti	Stop this fucking Brexit now!!
anti	Stop this fucking madness of Brexit,I won't stop immigration,the economy will crash
anti	Stop this nonsense you call brexit.
anti	Stp Brexit!! .‚ÄòThe ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.‚ÄôMartin Luther King, Jr
anti	Strange I turn it off because it is loaded with ignorant right wing leavers
anti	Strange, one of the reasons for Brexit was that they wanted more democracy. First they send they send the parlement and now they send the journalists home. Uk be on the lookout, these are dangerous times!
pro	Strangers in Brussels calling the shots for your country was a insane system.
anti	Striking: Vote Leave Uses Same Tactics As Lobbyists Who #Deny Climate Change
pro	Strong borders make strong nations. Good fences make good neighbours.
pro	Stuff the EU where the sun don't shine. NONE of the withdrawal agreement is acceptable.
pro	Stuff the EU, let's just deal with the individual nations of Europe and cut out those parasitic middle men.
pro	Stupid ignorant and some totally selfish. Lets hope there is never a war because with people like this we are doomed. We voted out!!
anti	Stupid uneducated people don‚Äôt know what is good for them. Brexit was a failure and they gonna pay for that. Idiots who voted for the brexit didn‚Äôt understand how bad it will impact the UK. The country is becoming so poor
pro	Stupid woman, we're leaving on March 29th as per article 50, Brexit is already saved.
anti	Stupidity and hubris win the day. Good look Britain. You are going to need a lot of it.
anti	Stupidity at its height. Wait until food prices start to soar. What an absolutely assinine move.
anti	Stupit Brexiteers wants to have a Brexit, so they have to deal with the consequences. You can‚Äôt have both.
anti	Successive UK governments exploited whatever loophole they could find, pumping untreated sewage into our seas until 1998 ‚Äì longer than any other European country. Now they've started again. #Brexit
pro	Such a happy but also sad day. Britain is one of the greatest nations on this earth. After the US of course. Lol
anti	"Such a moronic waste - throwing away your country's position, power, and wealth for zero in return. The cunts behind it will have done a more successful job of destroying/weakening this country than a thousand ""terrorist cells"" could ever have fantisised of. ""See it. Say it. Sorted""."
anti	Such a pathetic situation... when the drama ends and the dust clears we will see who's who, true identities will be revealed :D and yes UK will rejoin in one form or another IF there is still a European Union... after UK realises they cannot survive alone... so sad... it's just a lot of time that needs to pass, some things take time. The effects will be definitely detrimental for all of us.
pro	Such a pity - it was a good idea when it was the Common Market. We‚Äôve had co-operation between Europe‚Äôs countries for decades - Europol and Euratom long precede the EU, Concorde was up and running as an Anglo-French project long before anyone had heard of open borders or the single currency. The problem is that politicians always want more and more power, so having started something useful for helping trade, they turned it into a one-size-fits-all, single-currency bloc. Then they expressed surprise that political parties were formed in many member-countries to oppose that.
anti	Such an idiota. You can know officially be an US colony. Enjoy.
pro	Such awesome news for our beautiful Great Britain....back to being independent again
anti	Such nonsense! Britons seems to be pure idiots (sorry to say)...
pro	Suggest you pull yourself together. Brexit is happening and your feels are not of interest or value in the discussion. Grow up.
pro	Support of UK leaving EU from US.
anti	Sure there's other non-EU countries to trade with (after all the USA is the UK's largest trade partner), but how they will perceive the UK after a Brexit in terms of reputation and renewed position in the world stage will remain to be seen.
pro	Surely Europe shot itself in the foot when the UK joined it. Thank God (and the gullible voters) for Brexit!
anti	Surely the best way to 'fight back' is to stay in the EU and stand our ground? We've run away. Hardly fighting.
anti	Surely we should now all work to damage the UK‚Äôs economic prospects as much as possible and force it to re-apply for entry to the EU to save itself?
anti	Surely you‚Äôre not still pretending that a glorious sunlit uplands brexit is possible. This dreadful deal of May‚Äôs is the best you‚Äôre going to get. If you don‚Äôt want it your only choice is #Remain
anti	Suspect many of those are pensioners with their guaranteed triple lock, winter fuel allowances, free travel etc and are protected from the economic deprivations of hard Brexit.
pro	Sweetsuccess, I'm educated and voted Brexit. If the vote had gone the other way, I would have respected it. I also know when my caps lock is on.
pro	Switzerland and Norway are doing quite well without the E.U. ¬†Britains have become jealous. ¬†Will France or Italy be next? ¬†When will the E.U. currency be equivalent to the Bolivar?
pro	Switzerland is not in the EU and is surrounded by 5 EU countries but has no hard border with any of them! Of course no deal isn‚Äôt perfect, no solution including a remain is! But food shortages... not going happen! Goods still move perfectly freely under #WTO with physical checks!
pro	TBH since Britain voted out last June only good things have happend like the economy growing and unemployment going down. The only bad thing is the pound losing value but its not the end of the world.
pro	TELL YOUR FRIENDS TO VOTE LEAVE!
pro	THE DECISION HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE. LEAVE MEANS LEAVE. GOODBYE EU.
pro	THE GOVERNMENT IS RUNNING DOWN THE CLOCK ALL RIGHT, TO TRY AND EXTEND THE TIME. WE SHOULD JUST GET THE HELL OUT NOW, THE EU IS SO CORRUPT AND SHOWS ITSELF TO BE SO ALL THE TIME, THERE IS NO DEMOCRACY IN THE EU.
pro	THE UK BETTER BREXIT OR FOREVER LOSE THEIR LIBERTY!
pro	THEY WANT TO KEEP US TIED SO THEY CAN CONTINUE ASSET STRIPPING THE UK.
pro	THIS IS A VICTORY FOR ALL US WHITE PEOPLE !
pro	THIS IS IT, Freedom day from the EU. As said sometime back, we may have lost some battles Brexiteers, but we WOULD win the War. We can thank the despicable remoaner MPs with their obvious hate for Britain and Democracy that made Brexit most likely. The future is ours now
pro	THIS IS OUR COUNTRY WE HAVE A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK ITS NOW OR NEVER IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH PARTY YOU SUPPORT THIS IS ABOUT OUR COUNTRY YOU ONLY HAVE TO VOTE CONSERVATIVES TO GET BREXIT DONE OR SPEND YEARS TRAPPED IN EUROPEAN UNION WE CAN TRADE GLOBALLY
pro	THIS IS WHY WE LEFT AND WANT TO BE OUT COMPLETELY
pro	THe UK HAS LEFT THE EU YIPEEE!
pro	TO BOLDLY GO, WHERE ANYONE COULD GO BEFORE!
pro	TODAY is the United Kingdom's INDEPENDENCE DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
pro	TRUTH: The English bow before NO ONE!
pro	Take back control from the unelected EU elite
pro	Take back control of your own destiny, Britain! Bring back Great Britain's balls! VOTE LEAVE!
pro	Take back control.
pro	Take back control; People's VOTE, go for Brexit
pro	Take back your sovereignty Britain! VOTE LEAVE
anti	Take the cash for their constituents, and vote AGAINST her corruption.. Vote for Peoples Vote or to revoke Article50. Campaign to the constituents for Remaining in the EU. This isn't a game of deal or no deal. It's peoples' lives
pro	Take your patriotism back Britain! Be your own country, not a linked state in a socialist aimed system!
anti	Taking back control From Brussels and handing the control to Trump and Washington
anti	Talk about shooting yourself on the foot
pro	Talking about not leaving now? Just goes to show the people don't have a say or any power now..... Why should a small bunch of politicians over rule what the people of Britain have Voted for??? Let's not complicate things we voted out respect it do it! Otherwise you will lose the people as its a total slapIn there face !
pro	Tally ho, Brits! Once again youse have shown the way to a world choking on collectivism, parochialism, arrogance and protected selfishness. For the second time since 1215 Britain has shown the world how to stand up and fight back.
pro	Tate & Lyle has warned its employees that EU membership suppresses wages and increases costs.
pro	Taxation without representation didn't feel too good did it?
pro	Tbh I wouldnt want any types of immigrants in my country. They usually bring problems with them that we then have to deal with. Tbh young people dont know as much as the old people about their country, thats a fact. I think that the voting age should be higher.
pro	Tbh, I find the EU irritating. So the less influence it has, the better.
anti	Teachers shouldn't be teaching kids politics. It's too open to abuse. They should be teaching them how to evaluate what they see and hear. How to see through the hype. How to identify truth amongst a barrage of fake news. Then and only then will they know what they're voting for!
pro	Technology could take care of it, but he keeps turning it down. Other countries with borders with the EU don't have a problem. They want to hang on to us for our money that is obvious.
anti	Technology, globalisation, austerity and many other factors have changed the landscape of the world we live in. Leaving the EU will not remedy these changes no matter what.
pro	Tell Brussels to go fu-k them selfs and leave on WTO
pro	Tell Tusk to Go-Away and mind his own business. We don't want to stay, or delay, or pay, or have much of anything to do with you greedy, arrogant, self appointed idiots. Just shut up and push-off.
anti	Tell me. Why is membership of the EU preventing you from doing that?
pro	Tell that Brussels house of Babel that you are no longer gonna sort the frogs from the fish. Same for schnitzel. And haggis if they're not careful.
pro	Tell that to the French protesters, the Catalonians, the Basques, the Greeks, Spanish, Italians, Hungarian and Poles. The EU is not a union of equals. Germany dictates & all subservient states must follow or else face harsh consequences.
pro	Teresa May did go to Oxford University when many fewer students actually qualified and has become the UK's only second female Prime Minister. I think she has quite a good grasp of what Brexit means!
pro	"Teresa May says that to have a no deal is sailing for uncharted waters. England has sailed in uncharted waters before and the result was the British empire. Roosevelt once said ""The only to fear is fear itself"" Please go for a no deal Brexit for heavens sake111"
anti	Terrible mistake .
pro	Thank God for Brexit, Now it's time for Australia to follow their Mother of the British Commonwealth!
pro	Thank God for Nigel Farage! At last someone who speaks sense, a voice for Freedom and Democracy. Sorry you were not very visible on national TV last night, there were more weather forecasts and remoaners lamenting Brexit than scenes of joy. This is a major historical/joyful occasion where our Democratic rights have FINALLY won through. The backdrop of a BBC newsroom surrounded by blue and yellow stars was appalling. The next step should be to change the stranglehold over our media and stamp out the negative propaganda and state run broadcasting machine. Give us some clean, clear facts we can see through the garbage. Thanks Nigel from the bottom on my heart.
pro	Thank God for his one nation conservative government. Finally the Brits are free.
pro	Thank God we have left, now we can fly our Great National Flag High and be proud.
pro	Thank God we've broke free of that monster that is the EU we're now a free and independent nation. I hope others in the EU follow.
pro	Thank God, we have finally left. Our country and sovereignty will be reinstated.
pro	Thank Goodness.‚Äôabout time!
pro	Thank Nigel. The E U is a big con. Brexit is wonderful.
pro	Thank You to the whole team, Sir Every day is party day since the election. Well done to the 17.4m & all other Democrats along the way üëè 2 days 4 hours 5 mins üèÜüá¨üáßüèÜ
pro	Thank god Britain is leaving in 21 days !!
anti	Thank god for delegates. People are too stupid to vote.
pro	Thank god that hated EU circle of stars will not be seen hovering gloatingly over UK official offices anymore...FREEDOM!!
pro	Thank god we are getting out of the EU.
pro	Thank god we're leaving the European Union in 2019!!
pro	Thank goodness 450 BBC journalists being sacked - we can do without all those pro EU lefties - no balance to Newsnight or BBC news anymore - completely infected by leftwing pro-EU people who clearly hate the UK
pro	Thank goodness Boris won election. Never hear from that squeaky Swinson woman anymore, no doubt looking for a job in the EU
pro	Thank goodness we are finally leaving, hopefully the radical left will now calm down...
pro	Thank the Good Lord. Welcome home Britain to who you and your awesome people are. It's now time to get busy reclaiming your sovereignty for yours and your next generations. MAKE BRITAIN GREAT AGAIN !!!!
pro	Thank you Boris Johnson and your government. Our nation will over the long term be wealthier as an independent, free trading one.
pro	Thank you God for Britain's freedom
pro	Thank you Great Britain! This is an example that must be followed by other countries around the globe.
pro	Thank you Jesus for Brexit. UK is a great nation. Together, in unity we will unleash its potential. No longer will one man in Brussels decide our destiny and carve our paths for us. Arise UK for your light has shone. God is for you.
pro	Thank you Nigel for everything you have done, 2 more weeks and we start to become independent
pro	Thank you U.K. for having the guts to save your own country.
pro	Thank you brexit! scottish independance inevitable.
pro	Thank you for all your efforts to get the 2016 result honoured. We have all made a difference together.
pro	Thank you for breaking away from that poisonous tit called the EU. You don‚Äôt need 150 people in Brussels to approve a butt plug. I‚Äôm proud of you.
anti	Thank you for holding steady on the backstop. Quite a few UK MPs and citizens need an urgent history lesson, or to google Good Friday Agreement at the very least. My family in N Ireland do not want the return of the Troubles. Or brexit. Or any of this Tory madness. #Remain
anti	Thank you for keeping the door open. So many are angry at the lies they were told and want to #stay in the EU. Nothing could be worse for the UK than #Brexit. I voted #Remain For my children and me. Please help, #StopBrexit
pro	Thank you. Democracy finally respected
anti	Thank you. I am Scottish and I live in a city that was bombed repeatedly during ww2. My great grandfather spoke about his experiences. Never again. The EU is their legacy and our legacy. I cherish my European friends. #brexit makes me so angry. It makes Scots so angry.
pro	Thank you. Now please do not cede fishing.
pro	Thank you.. it seemed like it was never going to happen this time last year, I nearly lost hope, we‚Äôve finally got our vote respected.
pro	Thankfully a slight majority chose to remain British
pro	Thanks 2 all #VoteLeave supporters @ #BBCDebate Thursday is the last chance 2 leave a centralising & anti-democratic EU & #TakeBackControl
pro	"Thanks America for the support and gongrats to America on getting your country back, I'm seeing on the news that they're saying England has left the EU. There' s 3 other countries within the UK WALES, SCOTLAND, NORTHERN IRELAND AND OF COURSE ENGLAND, SO PLEASE REMEMBER THERES OTHER LOVELY COUNTIES ALSO, PLUS WE IN WKAES VOTED OUT WITH ENGLAND) American good for you on you're new president elect, they're trying not to act article 50, the government didn't think we'd do it, in wales we Voted with England despite our differences, plus half of N Ireland. In Wales our steel industry for the first time has made a profit, so china can't import cheep Steele to Germany and then imported to the EU. Also Facebook is opening up on London, Obama threatened us that the UK would be the back of the queue, but Mr TRUMP will open up trade negotiations, I'm so glad American our cousins have always stayed together, we've got more in common with Americans and more alike with Americans than the EU. Plus our boarders will be now closed. All the best Loud, like Winston Churchill once said "" IF BRITAN HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE OPEN WATERS, SHE SHOULD ALWAYS CHOOSE THE OPEN WATERS."" We're not scared, they tried to ride the voting, but the numbers were so great they couldn't do it ‚úçÔ∏è screw the NWO üñï"
pro	Thanks God that we finally got rid of EU
pro	Thanks God!! I was worried, they will never leave!
pro	Thanks for challenging the establishment on behalf of the normal people Mike. Thanks for championing democracy the cornerstone of this great country.
pro	Thanks for creating loads of poverty jobs MAY and crippling the confidence of the ENGLISH people. Go and look after your 3rd world civilians
pro	Thanks for giving the public the platform to be the voice of reason. Keeping on believing in Great Britain!
anti	Thanks for that thoughtful post. One of the problems is that most of the British people that care about the advantages you have illustrated.... (Hundreds of thousands of them and myself included) ... were denied the right to vote in the referendum because we've been living within the EU but outside the UK for more than fifteen years. It was / is heartbreaking.
pro	Thanks for the celebration Nigel. If it wasn't for him, we would never have got to celebrate our independence, we never would have left. Arise Sir Nigel. A true hero.
anti	Thanks to brexiteers now we will be paying more for medicine Someone has to pay for whats coming.
anti	Thanks to the media supported Tory propaganda, they will be blaming Labour, EU beaurecrats, and brown and Slavic people from the East for the results of them punching themselves in the face. Don't expect self-awareness or or even them realizing who really is screwing them.
anti	Thanks to the real patriots who take the time to monitor, examine, challenge and communicate this hypocrisy. I still haven‚Äôt heard one reasoned fact from #Leave that portrays a single tangible benefit.
anti	Thanks to whomever just woke the kids up letting off fireworks.Selfishly pissing off the many for the benefit of a few- seems a fitting Brexit celebration
anti	"Thanks you older generations for ruining the future of younger generations such as 16 year olds who weren't allowed to vote :) P.S. The older generations will die before they see the consequences of their leave vote. Also older people are more likely to be xenophobic and less tolerant of migrants so more likely to be manipulated by the leave campaign to leave. Saying ""all immigrants will disappear"" even thought immigration from outside the EU is more that immigration from in the EU and we've seen how hard immigration is to control."
pro	Thankyou for respecting the vote and doing what the people wanted! Unlike some people who used delay tactics
anti	That 'Mass Immigration' is about 1% of our total population, and doesn't account for emigration; Net immigration figures are currently around 335,000 a year, or just under a 0.5% population increase. For comparison, there were just under 700,000 live births in just England and Wales. factoring in deaths (cursory search was around 500,000 in 2010) you're looking at anywhere from 150,000 to 200,000 added to the population each year just from births. So our population is growing by about 0.25% each year from births, and 0.5% from immigration, of which half is from outside the EU already. We aren't even increasing the budget for services by this amount in many areas, and they have been cut significantly in the past decade. Our services are stretched to the limit because our government lets companies shaft us financially, export their profit overseas without paying tax, and then tells us we all need to tighten our belts. Frankly, the last thing I want right now is those companies gaining untold influence over our future laws by making the Conservatives, or any of our current political parties, the ultimate power in our land.
anti	That Brexit has now happened is almost certainly a direct consequence of that 2 years of populist intimidation. Brexit...
pro	That EU membership money could be spent on the NHS
pro	That Yarsley is an idiot, we already import from non EU countries so the UK is already set up for it.
anti	That if it wasn't for the European resources the deprived areas of the North of England would not even have a library standing up !
pro	That is exactly what we voted for Leave in its entirety, No Deals , or payments . Just honour the democratic voters
pro	That is like asking why democracy is such a big deal, and why we don't just adopt a dictatorship because it's less effort. Sovereignty is crucial because it is the right of the people to control their own country. The more power the UK hands over to the EU the less say the people of the UK have over their own laws. If the EU wants a law and the UK people don't, why should the people be forced to follow a law they don't want? It comes down to who you think should be deciding the future of the UK, the citizens of the UK or EU politicians?
pro	That is so great ! Seeing Britons wave their flag a proudly as we in the USA wave ours ! Happy Independence Day UK !
anti	That many professional people in the government and so far Brexit its been a joke
anti	That may be, but the English don't need to drag everyone else down with them
anti	That might well be why the Leavers don‚Äôt like it. They all yearn to recreate those wonderful war years that they read about in comics when they were growing up.
anti	That narrow 2016 decision cannot be frozen in time. The demographic changes are plain to see and the doubts in the views of 1 million leave voting Labour supporters would likely now translate into a larger Remain majority.
pro	That will be the EU breaking in half soon.
anti	That woman ,from Manchester is wrong,i live in North ,i am nowhere near been rich and i voted Remain because i am well educated now and understand the game.
anti	That woukd be a very short sighted decision. Sure Britain makes a lot if products and had great trade influence but cutting ties with EU would mean some money glow would be redirected away from GB.
pro	That's absurd. You don't have to belong to the EU to have freedom of movement. There are these things called passports that work very well for Americans who travel across the globe.
pro	"That's bullshit. You don't get a redo when you lose a vote because you cried about it. That sets a ridiculous precedent where anybody can insist on a new vote on anything to ""make sure the people haven't changed their minds""."
pro	That's fair. I believe that there is potential for things to improve due to Brexit, such as a more equal and international trade relationship with the world. But there is the possibility that I was wrong and things won't get better. If it doesn't go well I'll hold my hands up and say I overestimated the power of the UK, but I still genuinely believe we are large enough and influential enough for this to be the success that it could be
pro	That's fake news about the British searching what's the Eu we all know what it is and over half of us hate it
pro	That's fine, keep it up then we can leave with a no deal, then we can put in our bill for monies owed to us from investments. A win win, we save ¬£39 billion as well as claiming the money the EU owe us and we are free of them.
pro	That's good we just want to leave
pro	That's great.... And hopefully Scotland soon will be able to do the same to the Union Jack.
anti	That's one small step for Boris Johnson, one giant leap backward for Great Britain.
anti	That's stupid as hell and since other EU countries start considering to leave now that GB is setting an example we're getting worried about the EU falling apart and war ensuing again.
pro	That's the point, the EU benefited from the membership of the UK. However, the UK gained nothing from membership of the EU.
pro	That's the spirit Boris, give them the ultimatum this must come to a close, it's taking up to much of our precious 'road to recovery' time.
pro	That's the spirit. The backstop is a terrible idea and will keep us under EU control forever
pro	That's true freedom
pro	That's what the eu amounts to, a bunch of plotters, sucking out everything good in sovereign countries.
pro	That's what the people voted for, when will politicians listen to the people OUT means OUT.
pro	That's why the smart thing to do is to leave and figure these things out later.
anti	Thats all Brexit supporters are capable of lies and vile abuse, keep it up DM.
anti	Thats it, i'm moving to the eu
anti	Thats such a selfish move from Britain, which makes all eu countries suffer
anti	Thats what happens when ...
pro	Thats what happens when UNELECTED LEADERS who know nothing of the plight and condition of their people force upon them a union that lambast and spits upon their national heritage.
pro	Thats why most people in the UK want out of the EU hell-hole.
pro	That¬øs right. If they don¬øt want to negociate that is no deal then. Good luck to Germany to bail out everyone and pay our share. Our 39 billion could be invested in our agriculture and industries to be less dependent on other countries.
anti	That‚Äôs the point. If you voted Brexit, you lost. If you voted Tory, you lost. Even if you‚Äôre rich, you lost. Because everyone else did.
anti	That‚Äôs what I think of Brexit. It‚Äôs a terrible idea, executed badly and it will not end well unless it‚Äôs stopped.
anti	That‚Äôs what happen when you let people without any economic knowledge vote in a referendum!
pro	"The ""Brexit"" referendum is a British domestic party politics manoeuvre and poorly conceived at that. It'll have far fewer consequences than most of the media"
anti	"The ""collective weight"" of partnerships such as the EU made it easier to deal with global threats, so we should not leave."
anti	"The ""leavers"" lied about everything"
pro	"The ""people"" who have been ""invited"" into Europe, by the globalists, are not the tolerant kind. The eussr politicians know this, but they are not aloud to say it. We all know this, and yet the great replacement is allowed to continue. Dark days ahead for Europe, the old continent. So good to be out - of the eussr, of course ... :)))"
anti	The #BRAINDRAIN starts now. People all over the country who have intelligence and talent will be plotting their escape to one of the EU27. Where will you go?
anti	The #Brexiters have attacked the EU incessantly for 47 years . Now they have had their way, they can't expect pro-EU people to shut up just because #Brexiters ask for it especially when #Brexit is wrecking their jobs, their prospects, prosperity and their health. #FBPE
pro	The #EU's architects never meant it to be a #democracy #EUref #Brexit #VoteLeave #TakeControl
anti	The 'in' vote will win by a landslide. It won't even be close. Business's, agriculture, common sense dictates Britain stays in
pro	The 'joke' is on the EU!
anti	The 12 top together, which you cite, do not even make up to what Britain exports to the EU. I have 12 mice and one cat, guess who eats who. Furthermore, what do you have to offer to the world? Arms and weapons? Lethal injections? And when the other industries, currently in Britain, like the pharmaceutical industry will want to move to the continent do if London loses the EMA -- European Medicines Agency -- which is likely to move to Sweden, then you may have foreign buyers for what remains to export (like Royal mugs and other trivia) but there won't be much left to trade anyway. No matter how yo turn it, Brexit will make England (the part that will remain of the UK) much poorer, and a hard brexit will make it into a basket case (like it was before it joined the EEC in 1973).
anti	The 2016 referendum was won through electoral crime. The government and Brexit MPs are, in effect, handling stolen goods and profiting from the proceeds of crime. They must be prosecuted and jailed and #Brexit must be stopped in order to return the UK to the rule of law.
anti	The 36% of leave voters who think that we'll suffer no negative consequences are like teenagers who think their allowance will continue ad infinitum, without considering where the money comes from.
pro	The 47 years we have been involved with the EU are only a drop in the ocean when we consider our long history; and to suggest that we are stepping into the unknown is defeatist nonsense. We are merely joining the other 160 odd countries who don't enjoy the' benefits' of EU membership
pro	The BBC editors must be choking back tears, as their campaign to ignore democracy has failed...
anti	The BBC has become as dumbed down as a brexiter.
pro	The BIGGEST benefit is FREEDOM. No more having UNelected bureaucrats making decisions for which they never are held accountable.
anti	The BRITs want to leave the EU and isolate themselves. What's next build wooden ships and colonize the world?
pro	The Best is yet to come !! Cheers to Freedom and sovereignty
anti	The Best thing for the is not Brexit but for May to make a hasty exit.
anti	The Best thing for the üá¨üáß is not Brexit but for May to make a hasty exit.
anti	The Brexit Job Loss Index is an attempt to keep track of the number of jobs lost in the UK due to Brexit. Look which part of the UK has suffered the most already‚Ä¶
anti	The Brexit Starzi. Be afraid..be very afraid. Unelected but trusted by an unstable liar of epic proportions to run the country.
anti	The Brexit baboons will be a whooping! They are meant to be masters of their own destiny now not held hostage by the whims of any Johnny come-lately-Foreigner. No Unicorns, no cake and eat it, and now no friends, hmmm looks a lot like no future. Oh how their pyrrhic victory smells exactly like ... $h!‚Ä†. Is this what Farage and Johnson promised?
pro	The Brexit chickens can't stop clucking, let's get the hell out of the EU and show them how the great UK can stand alone.. Come on NO DEAL
anti	The Brexit govt admitted last week that Brexit cannot work. Even Mugg agreed that none of the options beside staying the the CU would work.
anti	The Brexit is Britain's Trump: Stupid, costly, generally and objectively bad
anti	The Brexit is Britain's Trump: Stupid, costly, generally and objectively bad, but somehow gets taken seriously in a national election.
anti	The Brexit is a dumb idea. Dump the Tories.
anti	The Brexit is going to be a disaster for the U.K. It's not too late to stop the Brexit now, but time is running out for the U.K.
anti	The Brexit is tearing the UK apart!!
anti	The Brexit nightmare is entirely the Tories' fault!
anti	The Brexit vote has divided your UK for decades to come and has the potential to tear the UK apart
pro	The Brexit vote must be respected for the sake of our democracy
anti	The Brexit voters will realize they've made a terrible mistake when their pensions dry up.
anti	The Brexit was the most foolish idea the U.K. has ever had. The U.K. should stop this madness called Brexit and stay in the E.U. Only Putin and Trump want a Brexit because they have their own agenda to devide the E.U.
anti	"The Brexit was/is the worst thing we have ever done. "" The long walk back to sanity starts now."" Indeed."
anti	The Brexit will be meaningless and we‚Äôll all have our nuts taxed off. He‚Äôs been on holiday longer than he‚Äôs been PM in this term but I‚Äôm already over him.
anti	"The Brexit would be a mistake because it would not help Great Britain (GB) with lowering regulation standards, would weaken GB's position in trade negotiations, and would overall be a net negative to GB's international trade. Exiting the European Union would not help Great Britain take back control of its own regulation. According to the Economist, ""if a post-Brexit Britain wanted to retain full access to the single European market, it would almost certainly have to stick with most of the accompanying rules."" That is a long term impact. Exiting the EU would not help in trade negotiations. Currently 45% of all of GB's exports go to EU states. By being included in the single market allows GB to avoid substantial tariffs. A London based think tank concluded that GB's trade is 55% higher because it participates in the single market. If GB exits the EU there will have to be a turbulent and messy renegotiation with GB's largest trading partner that can only result in a net negative trade outcome. I strongly agree with the British Prime Minister this will cost British individuals jobs, businesses will close or move to other states, and overall the financial security of British citizens will be put in peril."
anti	The Brexiteer school of debating - keep shouting ‚Ä¶
anti	The Brexiteers just seem to want to wreck the economy, there is no coherent plan to their Brexit. Of course it wont be painful for them Johnson & Davis receiving ¬£10s of 10000s from JCB Mogg & Redwood making sure their investments are safe in the EU Farage make ¬£¬£¬£s off crashing the ¬£ & making sure HIS kids keep FOM Lawson taking up French residency Dyson escaping to SIngapore
anti	The Brexiteers will soon see that have been deceived. When the cars factor in the North of England starts to close after is too late.
anti	The Brexiters and their politicians are the worse people in the UK. Scum floats to the top.
anti	The Brexiters can't wait for empty shelves and rationing - it reminds them of the war.
anti	The Brexiters wanted to take Britain back to the 'good old days' and looking at the drop of the value of the pound, looks like they've truly succeeded.
anti	The Britain formerly known as Great. Brexit means poverty!
anti	The Britain of pre-2016 will no longer exist after Brexit. We will mourn it as a new Nasty Party country is built on extremist Thatcherism. It will be impossible to have any affection for this new country and it‚Äôs inhuman values.
pro	The British Empire is back.God Save the Queen
anti	The British are very arrogant.
anti	The British betrayed the European Union
anti	The British betrayed the European Union to declare Scotland independence, joins the EU. I London. Let it be a city state that joins the European Union.
anti	The British did a huge mistake.
anti	The British don't care about a part of their own country, N Ireland. They're willing to sell out peace there for Brexit. Pathetic ignorance. Reap the whirlwind...
pro	The British econemy would shrink really ? Maybe for ashort period of time, we import Billions more than we exportto the EU, only an idiot would dismiss the disasterous effect on other European countries if they did not trade with us.
pro	The British finally stood up against forced immigration and loss of their independence!! GO ENGLAND, screw the rest of the duck marching EU!!!
anti	The British have a dirty secret and this secret shows the British don't respect human rights.Still secret the British Dr Mengele of human exploitation is still hiding
pro	The British have chosen liberty with Brexit and can congratulate themselves every day.
anti	The British have never grown up, this is the stupidest decision a country has ever made in peacetime and which makes its own people poorer and the status of the country internationally completely insignificant.
anti	The British moan about immigration, but the only thing holding hundreds of thousands of refugees stuck in the Pas de Calais France is the EU. UK leaves the EU and you'll be getting lots of new visitors arriving very shortly in Kent.
pro	The British people DID vote for a no-deal Brexit and everyone knows it! Teresa May's refusal to deviate from her doom-laden path regarding Brexit in the wake of her resounding defeat proves that she has either been bought wholesale by Globalists, or that she is undoubtedly insane...
pro	The British people are furious. We gave so much for our democracy and freedom
pro	The British people are not made for the EU. The GOD designed them to rule the world.
pro	"The British people did the right thing! Move to ""Europe"" if you don't like the UK!!!"
pro	The British people don't want any deal we simply want to leave, I will never vote for a party that keeps us tied to the EU and hopefully 17.4 million others take mt lead
pro	The British people have now achieved their ambition to leave the dysfunctional, corrupt, maladministration and undemocratic EU. That gives Britain freedom to take control of our borders, our finances and enable our elected Parliament to create our own laws. Britain has once again become a sovereign Nation. Phase one is now complete and trade negotiations begin. EU bureaucrats would be advised both sides are obliged to negotiate in ‚Äògood faith‚Äô but, remember the well quoted British mantra of ‚Äòno deal is better than a bad deal‚Äô still prevails. With Britain carrying an annual trading deficit of ¬£98 Billion with the EU. That puts Britain in the driving seat.
pro	The British people have spoken and they said OUT
pro	The British people voted Leave DESPITE all the lies of the Remain campaign. So it was very much a valid referendum.
pro	The British people voted for BREXIT. Just do it! (Hard) There never should have been an EU to begin with; it was all a banker's scam and a globalists wet dream. If BREXIT helps crash the EU house of cards, even better; everybody gets their sovereignty back and globalism is defeated.
pro	The British people voted to come out, let‚Äôs just get out !
pro	The British people voted to leave your corrupt EU and that was to leave with no deals whatsoever.
anti	The British people were told they were joining a common market that would help break down the bureaucratic barriers impeding trade across Europe - was there any mention of a European superstate?
pro	The British people will VOTE LEAVE from the EU dictatorship and help free Europe and Europeans from it too :)
pro	The British people's decision to leave the EU is the right decision, we leave with out a deal and keep the 39 billion and goodbye to you all üòÇü§£ others will fallow our example üòä
pro	The British public voted leave, so we leave.
anti	The British public were duped by liars, charlatans and gangsters.
anti	The British public will regret the brexit vote. Unity is strength.
anti	The British shot themselves in the foot .Had they not got the brains to think about what kind of a mess they were getting themselves into?
pro	The British success story in a brilliant example: Jaguar Land Rover Slovakia is a Slovak subsidiary of the British car producer Jaguar Land Rover, itself a subsidiary of Tata Motors.The company produces Land Rover Discoveries in its factory in Nitra, where production started in October 2018.....OH!! How comes? Where is the British success??
anti	The British thought Europa was a kind of Hindustan. the fact is the UK is Hindustan, Europe is the successor of the Roman Empire. British are mentally third world.
anti	"The British took a hasty decision. Nothing stopped them to cut deals with other countries while inside the EU. Its immigration ""problem"" is not from EU but from UK's ex colonies."
anti	The British voted to leave the EU based upon racism without thinking the issue through just as Americans out of racism, anger, fear, selfishness elected the unfit, illegitimate Trump as president.
pro	The British working class have been getting screwed for the past 50 yrs while the top end of town has got richer beyond belief. No side of politics has given a shit until brexit came along. It is the first time in 50 years their views have counted for something. Brexit is a wake up call that a change of direction is needed.
pro	The British, like Americans, are like Dorothy with the ruby slippers. We can get back to Kansas. The answer is squeezing the Ruling Class by limiting their money, and reducing government, and it's bureaucracies, where ever they try to expand. Bigger government is not your friend. It is your Ruler.
anti	The Brits are just as dumb as 30% of the U.S. population
pro	The Brits are proud of having democracy. Respect the people's vote and put an end to this ridiculous show of incompetence and ambivalence.
anti	The Brits don't want immigrants so why don't they compromise? Leave all the agreements except the issue with visas and immigration. I think the Brits are finding out people in poorer EU nations can do their jobs, and more cheaply too.
pro	The Brits have shown us that you can leave the European Union, and you can come out better.
anti	The Brits like us Americans are fast becoming a new generation of fascists. I hope the EU will be able to withstand this rising tide of hate and self destruction.
anti	The Brits want everything for Free without hard work
anti	The Brits will pay the price for this election probably ending the loss of stature just like the U.S.
pro	The Brits: showing the world how it is done!! Congratulations from your cousins in the USA!!
pro	The Britz voted with clarity and courage. Be proud U.K.. Better days ahead. Down for the EU. Down for Labour.
pro	The Conservative party will ensure that we fulfil our duty in ensuring that stability, so that we can all, as one country go forward together.
anti	The Daily Express takes the opportunity to claim success for their campaign to leave the EU, telling readers: ‚ÄúYes, we did it.‚Äù Indeed! for once they are telling the TRUTH!! without the lies and the odious anti immigrant anti EU propaganda which they have systematically used for decades we would not be where we are today, at the edge of a precipice! That also goes for the Sun and the Daily Mail. They can all congratulate themselves and each other for a job well done!! Now , readers of the most corrupt press in the West, ENJOY!!
anti	The Dutch aren't that bothered that much anymore I think. Business in particular has already moved on and there's a lot of talk about the opportunities Brexit creates (rather than the challenges). A lot of debate about the value or otherwise of immigration but almost no respect for how they might feel as human beings. Nobody will come out of this well.
pro	The E U is failing...ask Italy or hungry or even Poland...
pro	The E union was bad idea from day one
pro	The E.U is nothing but totalitarianist bullies! We are leaving your concentration camp on the 29th of march!?
pro	"The E.U. is financially, politically & morally bankrupt. It's intentional ! When order has completely broken down in the E.U. then the U.N. will assume governance as planned. ""N.W.O Phase 1 complete"" ! Next ? The U.S. (The U.K. can still escape)."
pro	The E.U. needs to change its immigration laws, I think that's why a lot of English want out
pro	"The EU ""provides the most hospitable ecosystem in the developed world for rentier monopoly corporations, tax-dodging elites and organized crime,"""
pro	"The EU Brexit commission in Brussels today said & I quote ""the UK leaving the EU without a deal will have the equivalent effect of 19 member states simply walking away tomorrow!""... Yet here we are the unelected EU dictatorship refusing to do a deal. Losing the 5th biggest economy in the world will hurt them far more than us!!"
pro	The EU Commission does not understand democracy.
pro	The EU Is a dictatorship ran by Germans, who don't let any other country's have power. It's what hitter wanted, just in a more subtle way
pro	The EU NEEDS the UK. It is the EU that needs to be trying to make a deal with the UK. The UK simply needs to leave and take back control of its own destiny.
anti	The EU also funds innovation, which keeps our scence institutions at a world-class level.
anti	The EU amplifies Britain's voice in global climate talks and helps us to stand up against polluters in other countries. #StrongerIn
anti	The EU and the Euro, despite their faults and failings are going from strength to strength as Global Britain descends into the farce of a second rank failing state.
pro	The EU are adrift, whilst us Brits head for safer waters.
anti	The EU are consistent, they say what they mean and stick to it. The UK Government are also consistent if you include running around like headless chickens.
pro	The EU are desperate and are not to be trusted. If they dictate to us we should just walk away.
pro	The EU are now terrified of a resurgent UK with a vibrant economy, free to trade with the world, right on their doorstep.
pro	The EU are pathetic. Full of threats and bullying tactics. Nice people. They don't learn. They clearly want a hard Brexit.
pro	"The EU are selling our fish to China. We need to cut out the EU middleman and ensure CI and UK fishermen are able to get their fish in to Chinese hands. Welsh welks are on sale in S. Korea. It has been discussed in a Fisheries debate in HoC. Check it out via Hansard. Gove talks of a ""¬£1bn bonanza"" post brexit."
pro	The EU are taking all our jobs, fishing, steel, just two, did you know that the EU paid for ford transit factory to move to TURKEY more jobs gone, and other companies have gone all in the passed and now we are out they will pay for lots more to go over there. Now the EU want to kill Briton
pro	"The EU are utterly undemocratic and run by a dictatorial ""bunker"" mentatilty that refuses to countenance reform or a change of mindless ambition."
pro	The EU bothered me-EU migrants never did so long as they weren‚Äôt Roma or criminally minded.
pro	The EU can go whistle, the more competitive we are, the better for us, and after the way they've treated us, I personally don't give two hoots how hard it is for them!
anti	The EU can live without 39bn. Can the U.K. survive when no-one will trade with you because you can¬øt be trusted?
pro	The EU cannot imagine life without controlling us in some way. WE however can live without their interfering and bullying. We're out!
pro	The EU delayed everthing so now they must face the cosequence WTO deal please
pro	The EU demands too much and gives too little (from my perspective).
pro	The EU deserve no deal. Bring it on.
pro	The EU destroyed Britain's fishing industry, and now is the time and opportunity to rebuild it. We had one of the largest fishing fleets in the world before joining the repressive and restrictive EU.
pro	The EU does not have any Money. IT'S OUR MONEY
anti	The EU doesn't need most of what goes on in London as far as I can see.
pro	The EU doesn't really have any negotiating strength left. The UK is free to pursue their own trade agreements with individual countries in any fashion they prefer, as well as deny EU fisherman access to their waters.
pro	The EU doesn‚Äôt understand the power of nationalism. It attempts to retain nationality as a cultural right. On the other hand, it deprives individual nations of the power to make many decisions.
pro	The EU elite want to flood Europe with migrants! against this! against EU!
pro	The EU flag revolts me. I feel the same way about the Nazi flag and the Soviet banner with hammer and sickle. All these flags proclaim tyranny.
anti	The EU gives us freedoms and rights, Trade Unions do the same albeit at a lower or more local level, yet the British working man has been manipulated into opposing both, all that forelock tugging must eventually hurt.
pro	The EU globalist's are trying to disove out nation to take over our sovierghenty to wipe out our rights
pro	The EU had virtually destroyed the UK. I can‚Äôt believe people are debating on what is obviously a corrupt and flawed political union geared to benefit career politicians once voted out of office!
pro	The EU has a crack in the ship and I don't t want Britain on it when it starts to sink
pro	The EU has a whole department who's sole job is to annoy the British.... after Brexit we can never be friends
pro	The EU has admitted it wants more control and closer ties over it‚Äôs members. Hell its even mooting the idea of a EU army. No thanks.
pro	The EU has already sown the seeds of its own demise by expanding too fast, and not even applying its own terms and conditions to new members - it all goes through with a wink and a nod.
pro	The EU has always been an experiment from day one and there were concerns even from the point of before we entered that it wasn't necessarily the best deal for Britain at the time.
pro	The EU has always operated a give and take policy We give They take
pro	The EU has been sucking blood off UK for longer than necessary. No looking back. No deal. That‚Äôs it.
pro	The EU has caused us a lot of social issues here. The city I grew up in had acquired lots of negative cultures from EU citizens. Begging, homelessness, throwing the change down on the train floor so they could pick your pockets. They took over local bars and wouldnt employ anyone British, they set up illegal hotels next to houses where people had saved all their lives to buy. We noticed it, all of it. Im sorry Europe but some of your grifter citizens are responsible for the break up. Since Brexit vote, it has improved and its noticeable.
pro	The EU has destroyed Europe. It's sad! I'm glad Great Britain, the land of my ancestors, is going to leave
pro	The EU has destroyed Europe. It's sad! I'm glad Great Britain, the land of my ancestors, is going to leave. We might just do the same thing here in Texas.
pro	The EU has even ruined the charm of Malta with indiscriminate road building. Same goes for Madeira.
pro	The EU has failed to do its job. GB will be absolutely fine after we leave
pro	The EU has flawed with the implementation of a worrying amount of legislation
pro	The EU has grown into a monster, an anti democratic monster capable of overthrowing governments against the will of the people, they have too much power, it's just wrong
pro	The EU has just as much to loose as the UK the parasites in Brussels are determined to hang on to the English cash cow and that's all we are to them open borders must be fantastic for terrorists no border checks come and go when they like
pro	The EU has never been ‚Äúnice‚Äù. It is a trade and regulatory superpower that is used to getting its own way.The UK is now discovering what it means to be on the other side of the table.
pro	The EU has only ever been interested in British money, nothing more. We are a cash cow.  That is why they have been wanting the extensions, and still are gearing towards trying to get this transition extended. Its about our contributions, our money. They need our contributions to continue as long as possible.  The difference now is, there won't be another extension. They have 11 months to work with us to get a deal sorted, or its WTO and Singapore on Thames. Personally, I'm in favor of leaving without a deal. It will deliver the absolute clean break we need.
anti	The EU has prevented inter European war.
anti	The EU has provided an environment in which the countries of Europe can co-operate and flourish without killing their populations on grounds of nationalism. There is NO greater argument in favour of union in Europe. NONE.
pro	The EU has said NO to changes, thats the problem, all the debating in the commons is a waste of time Delaying brexit , this is another ploy by the remainers to keep the UK in the EU, this extension could go on and on for YEARS, the UK leaves on March 29th 2019
pro	The EU has shown it's true colours. It's a power hungry monster with little regard for those it rules. Only a fool would yield any authority to it, which is why I don't like the idea of our fate being in the hands of our civil service.
anti	The EU has taken on multinational giants like Microsoft, Samsung and Toshiba for unfair competition. The UK would not be able to do this alone.
pro	The EU has taken, taken and taken again over the years. The can't grasp that things have changed and slow on the uptake.
anti	The EU has to be strong and make the UK an example of it - with all this love going and whatever, let us remember the lies used by the Leave campaign.
pro	The EU has to pay us billions in trade tariffs plus they dont get the 39 billion for that rotten deal RUN the clock down to a no deal.
pro	The EU have been scamming us for decades, moving our manufacturing, collecting our import tariffs from around the world and pocketing it, building up Rotterdam whilst our ports disintegrate, tendering our defence out so Spain and others build our war ships. Tony Blair and his Liberal types are an embarrassing sell out for this country.
pro	The EU have been soaking Britain of their wealth for decades. Now they will have the opportunity to take back control and establish their own destiny.
pro	The EU have done nothing but try to bully the U.K. into submission.
pro	The EU have gone through the three most destructive phases of Grief, that of Shock, Denial and Anger. They are now on the fourth: Guilt, or perhaps the fifth Sorrow and Depression but they will soon move onto the sixth that is Acceptance and begin to work towards a deal that allows them to keep the benefits of accessing their largest export market, the UK. But one should always remember that the EUs sense of loss is driven by the fact that they always got more out of the relationship than we did. What I do know is, we will never go back.
pro	The EU have learned nothing from Brexit but our future is bright
pro	The EU have no right to tell us how we should trade with non EU countries
pro	The EU have said no renegotiations so i don't see any alternative to leaving with no deal.
pro	The EU idea was hashed up by the NWO Kleptocrats (bankers & multinational corps - NOT their citizenry) for self serving benefits (some benefits did trickle down, but not enough & way too much collateral damage - especially in recent years). Glad to see Brits open their eyes for a change. This Vox post is heavily biased and almost completely wrong (w/regards to employment & trade, especially). The only thing this article got right is that the transition will be difficult. But, the UK is better for it.
pro	"The EU interpretation of a ""level playing field"" is for the UK to do what they tell us to do."
pro	The EU is CANCER..
pro	The EU is NOT a democracy
pro	The EU is a Dictatorship. Nigel F is an asshat but he wasn't kidding when he asked who they were, because most EU citizens don't have a fucking clue about who is making these laws and regs and have zero say on which ones effect their Country. I don't want to leave the EU, I want to see it collapse!
pro	The EU is a George Soro's puppet. The plan is destroy the sovereignty of European countries and create a single and centralized government, so they can pass laws valid for all member countries without even having popular approval, which is already happening today, but on a smaller scale.
pro	The EU is a anti-democratic, bureaucratic monstrosity that only serves itself. It is filled with failed politicians who are paid huge sums of money to do nothing but fill their pockets. The only thing we need in Europe is free trade. Brussels in its current form needs to go down.
pro	The EU is a bigger threat to European civilization than Hitler and Stalin ever were. Hopefully one day the european masses will see this, and string the lot of them up in the streets.
pro	The EU is a complete sham. It‚Äôs a criminal organisation that should be dismantled.
pro	The EU is a conglomeration of unadulterated chaos.
pro	The EU is a crumbling mess, a 50's solution.
pro	The EU is a dictatorship.who would not want to have more control over there own country.
pro	The EU is a disgraceful organisation in my opinion. It has become far too large and complex. It is not just a threat to democracy its killed democracy.
pro	The EU is a fascist organisation. We need to hold our nerve and Theresa must go.
pro	The EU is a fundamentally corrupt organisation. Not so very different to FIFA. As a businessman, exporting product worldwide, I can assure you all that life outside the EU will improve our trading position, help our economy grow, secure our borders and put the G back into Great Britain.
pro	The EU is a monster Ponzi scheme run by dictators in Brussels! Thank God we are leaving!
pro	The EU is a road accident and the UK is now in a car passing by on the other side of the road watching but glad not to be involved.
anti	The EU is a scapegoat, as are the immigrants. The UK's problems were caused by the 2008 financial crisis¬†just like most other countries problems.
pro	The EU is a scourge upon humanity. Disband it.
anti	The EU is a single market in which no tariffs are imposed on imports and exports between member states.
pro	The EU is a sinking ship, a giant bureaucracy set up to feed the bureaucrats whose only job is to prescribe ever more self-serving socialist policies to grow the bureaucracy, while remaining completely impotent on real critical issues like the migrant crisis
pro	The EU is a sinking ship. It's a dying idea and Britain should get out now.
pro	The EU is a total sham of a democracy. It cheapens the idea of democracy.
pro	The EU is a totalitarian, anti-democratic, anti-nationalist organization. It needs to be completely dissolved.
pro	"The EU is a tyrannical and discredited sham that has hijacked and imposed political union on half a billion people. Far from the promised land of milk and honey, in reality the EU has proved to be the shoehorn for forced and unwanted ""ever closer union"". The EU is a racket that continues to strangle the life out of Europe with its incompetence and constant crises. The EU must be destroyed"
pro	The EU is about to make the free internet history. See the new Copyright directive (Article 13 particularly.) Typical for this bureaucratic nightmare. The British were right to vote out.
pro	"The EU is all about a new world order, one world government. To all the native (white) people of the UK, embrace your new found sovereignty and take your country back. Starting by closing down the 3rd world Muslim immigrant flood gates and kicking out the ones that are already there. As for the affects on the economy, jobs, travel etc. you can figure out those problems as you move along. A country is suppose to be defined by its people not its borders. This is the first ""small"" step to halting the genocide of the white race and its culture by the ""J"" team."
pro	The EU is already looking and sounding last century.
pro	"The EU is an ""irresponsible guardian of democracy"", why do you think we are having this referendum? Should Remain win, then Leaver's will continue to campaign, to highlight the idiocy of belonging to such an organisation. Vote Leave."
anti	The EU is an increasingly important pillar of our security, especially at a time of instability in the Middle East and in the face of resurgent Russian nationalism and aggression.
pro	The EU is an organisation devoted to taking power away from the accountable level, the national government, so it can be exercised on behalf of big business.
pro	The EU is an undemocratic organisation. Therefore they have not accepted the result of the 2016 Referendum and still haven't accepted we are leaving. All this time they have been entertaining die hard Remainers like Tony Blair, Nick Clegg, Andrew Adonis who have told them they can overturn Brexit. All the above and many others in the Cabinet are simply looking for the valued prize, a place in an institution which can keep them in wealth and luxury for the rest of their lives. Peter Mandelson and Neil Kinnock, both backing remain in the House of Lords are in the pay of the EU as long as they keep the flag flying. They are just two of many I am sure. The whole Club is rotten to the core.
pro	The EU is an unelected dictatorship!
pro	The EU is an utter disaster, best wishes to the UK getting free of that sick dying animal.
pro	The EU is as bad as Democrats trying to take our guns
pro	The EU is basically controlled by germany. Yep the germans finally conquered europe, and anyone that doesnt like it is a bad guy
pro	The EU is behaving just like an obsessive, abusive, possessive partner who can't accept that their abused partner has left the relationship. We will no longer be dictated to, and any deal will be discussed as EQUALS, which is what we are now. If they don't like it, there are plenty more fish in the sea (and all the ones around our coastline will belong to OUR fishermen!
anti	The EU is being scapegoated for British problems and the fallout of the banking crisis & the poor have bought it hook line & sinker. The tragedy is going to be that if we Leave the poor will be hit the hardest and disenfranchised even more. Britain is a mess.
pro	The EU is collapsing anyways. Mind as well get out before it gets bad
pro	The EU is collapsing before our very eyes! We are getting out just at the right time!
pro	The EU is collapsing. If your house were collapsing where would you rather be - in or out?
pro	The EU is collapsing. Italy is nearly bankrupt and we ain't paying the 39 billion so hard BREXIT it is. We all have computers and Amazon if things go Pete tong.
pro	The EU is communist, not fascist.
pro	The EU is corrupt, it‚Äôs the Nazis all over again. Trying to take over the world using economic means rather than bombs. Do we really want to be part of a global fraternity that is so evil and corrupt.
pro	The EU is corrupt, self-serving, and is certainly no friend of the UK
pro	The EU is dangerous It is getting worse and they want an EU Army You may laugh now, but I hope you dont pay later The EU needs to go , and go *quickly*‚Ä¶
pro	The EU is dead .. try watching YouTube or some other of the videos of the YellowVests right across France, not just Paris. Also Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium
anti	The EU is doing exactly what it said it'd do. It's not its fault the Brexiters are clueless.
pro	The EU is doomed.
pro	The EU is dying the only answer is to disband it
pro	The EU is enormously powerful.
pro	The EU is every citizen's enemy and many don't realise just what the EU is or its plan.
pro	The EU is expensive and corrupt.
pro	The EU is failing politically and economically. It only works for Germany economically, but politically it is seeing the rise of extremism again because of mass youth unemployment and the hollowing out of the middle class. Thus it is a perfect time to leave before we have to bail out the corrupt Italian banks.
anti	"The EU is far better prepared than the English jokers. And I'd rather have no EU deal with the UK than a deal that undermines the EU, exactly the thing many Brexiters would want to do. It's easy to sort out a deal ""ASAP"", but that doesn't mean that'll result in a good deal."
pro	The EU is far from perfect and there is a case for leaving it.
anti	The EU is far too complex for Trump supporters to understand. If it can't be explained by a slogan on a hat they don't want to know about it.
pro	The EU is finished anyway, so it's either get out now or wait until it all falls apart. Personally I think get out now is the better option.
pro	The EU is full of crap.
pro	The EU is garbage, congratulations from America.
pro	The EU is going to fail with in the next 10 years
pro	The EU is good for Germany and the globalists. Not for the rest of the other members of the EU. BREXIT is and was the BEST DECISION the UK ever made.
pro	The EU is good for Germany and the globalists. Not for the rest of the other members of the EU. BREXIT is and was the BEST DECISION the UK ever made. The sooner they get on with it, the better! Socialism and open borders destroys countries, it doesn't help them.
pro	The EU is in a terminal state and any country that wants to survive needs to get out now.
pro	The EU is in meltdown mode. Time to save ourselves and our children before we go down with them. This is our one chance to be free again.VOTE LEAVE.
anti	The EU is in the driving seat. Brits need to stop thinking they're the powerful empire they once was. They're not. Their empire was defeated long ago. They're nothing but an insignificant island nation that needs the EU more than the EU needs them
pro	The EU is in the process of implementing World Socialism, even Communism
pro	The EU is just a gravy train for the elite....a bureaucratic monster in a feeding frenzy. How any self respecting Brit can defend it is beyond me.
pro	The EU is like one's divorced wife, who still wants to use one's car, dip into one's bank account, tell one who one can and cannot meet and so on. BoJo is correct for once, you have to be mad to accept such a deal, it's like being in the EU in all but name.
pro	The EU is like the 'mob' in TV dramas like the Sopranos. It is always about the money.
pro	The EU is like the emotionally abusive boyfriend that you can't leave but desperately want to. It treats you like c r a p, says you can't hang out with your other mates, steals all your money and intimidates you. Why on earth would you stay?
pro	The EU is made up of small nations and nations that don't realize that they are small yet
pro	The EU is no friend of the UK. If UK doesn't break away now, it will be much worse in a few years when they don't have any other choice.
pro	The EU is no match for the might of the Commonwealth. We shall crush them!
anti	The EU is not bluffing.¬†The integrity of the Single Market is much, much more important than the losses of a no deal.
anti	The EU is not falling apart, Young people WANT the EU, you can clearly see this in Brexit results, most Young people acually voted to remain and in some decades those Young people will be the majority. The EU can't find a common immigration policy or a tax policy for example because older people don't want them, but Young people do, but again, sooner those older people will not be there anymore, and Europe will be able to live as a country
pro	The EU is not going anywhere. Nothing stopping us reapplying to join the EU in 40-50 years time when the impact of brexit can be properly evaluated. With real world facts... Remainers really are so shortsighted and selfish.
pro	The EU is not what it was when we joined and we voted to leave after 50 years of loyalty. Most of the world are not EU members and they are just fine, trust me when I say us Brits can handle it too.
pro	The EU is nothing but a waste of taxpayers money. those bureaucrats have abused their position only to enrich themselves and their sponsors instead of looking out for european interests. im glad britain voted out and i hope the rest of will too
pro	The EU is out dated.. Stale.. One sided and racist to its own... Time to go!!!
pro	The EU is strangling us. We don‚Äôt need life support from a foreign parliament or an isolated ‚Äúsingle‚Äù market when there is a world of trade to tap into. We need to remove this tumour and recuperate.
pro	The EU is structurally flawed and doomed. It was modeled on the Soviet system - and it is heading in the same direction (down). When you are aboard a sinking ship, the only sane thing to do is abandon ship. We could do so much with the ¬£55 million a day we pay to the EU.
pro	The EU is the beast rising out of the sea having seven heads with seven crowns upon their heads, the book of revelations speaks about it. You can not buy, sell, or trade without using their s system.
pro	The EU is the fourth Reich.. Vote to leave now, sign the government petition..no 200165 Leave Now.
pro	The EU is the new USSR
pro	The EU is the past. 93+% of the world population live outside the EU and all the economic growth is outside the EU.
pro	The EU is the prototype for the New World Order, in which democracy will cease to exist
pro	The EU is titanic, it has already hit the iceberg. The UK are the first people into the lifeboats. We have rowed away and awaiting rescue. While the EU is rearranging the deck chairs in the dark.
anti	The EU is well and alive. The UK is paralyzed, confused and scared.
pro	The EU isn't doing as well as it used to and it's really down skewed economic reporting that suggests the eurozone is doing great.
anti	The EU isn't perfect but working together is better than running off and sulking in the corner.
pro	The EU itself is a failed experiment of corruption and lies. It's failed to handle current and past issues and it continues to fail to democratically represent the citizens it preports to do so to.
pro	The EU itself is losing global share. It policies have failed. The UK should be globally outlooking not an EU crumb hoover where we have no say. Anyone can see this political club is ridiculous.
pro	The EU just can't stop giving examples of why it's such a good idea to leave.?
pro	The EU just trying to get every last penny out of us until we leave
pro	The EU just trying to get every last penny out of us until we leave.
pro	The EU like the UN are globalist organisations with unelected members who only care about making evil corporations richer
pro	The EU may be good for small countries or poor countries, but for the UK, I think the benefits we get are far less than the things we pay.
pro	The EU may want and have 'Level' playing field. That's in their area. We in the UK are no longer playing for their side. We also have a level playing field... equipped with drainage for dealing with rediculous regulations, unbiased referee's (commissioners) and interference from UE courts. We have also rejoined the World league. We will be champions.
anti	The EU must feel like they are negotiating with a mentally disturbed child who spends most its time shouting incoherent nonsense to appease the derranged voices (aka leavers) in its head. How can you have a negotiation with someone who is completely detached from reality and lacking any self-awareness regarding their current predicament?

pro	The EU need Brexit to fail, so the only viable approach is no further negotiations and Cliff Edge, to concentrate the EU's leaders minds, British troops should withdraw from NATO operations.
pro	The EU needs The United Kingdom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland because they know we are the best country in the world. We are & will always be part of Europe & can defend the continent & don't need the EU
pro	The EU needs a drastic change of attitude if it wants a deal with Great Britain.
pro	The EU needs a massive shake-up internally, as well as the added pressure supplied by an external source, and Brexit supplies both.
pro	The EU needs the UK more then the UK needs the EU, we must not forget that.
pro	The EU needs to DIE! They are just not getting the message. I live for the day there is no EU, and I hope I get the see all of their leaders hung on live TV!
anti	The EU negotiates trade agreements with the rest of the world. Outside the EU Britain would have to renegotiate trade deals alone. While the EU is the world‚Äôs largest market, a UK outside the EU would not be a high priority for other counties to negotiate a trade deal.
pro	The EU only want our money, we have been mugged all these years.
pro	The EU only wanted us for our money.
pro	The EU or whatever it was called under it's previous trading names has never give Britain any respect since the off in 1973. Why on earth should it start now? The raison d'etre of the EU is to be anti- Anglo-Saxon. They hate Britain and they hate America. Simple as that. And there isn't a cat in hell's chance of a UK politician who will stand up up to them.
pro	The EU over steps and forces the countries to take on laws that have been suicidal towards to people.
anti	The EU provided the longest period of peace we ever had in Europe so I guess it's Anschluss time again
anti	The EU provided the longest period of peace we ever had in Europe so I guess it's Anschluss time again.
pro	The EU provides no surprises. The UK should just withdraw.
pro	The EU realised that we have escaped and are now desperately trying to handcuff us again. We are their prized pet or treasure island as we have become known in Brussels. Boris is having none of it.
pro	The EU says no - the UK says no deal it is then. Finally we would get the clean break the UK needs to flourish without kowtowing to any more EU rules.
pro	The EU seems to be like a dictator. Just listen to that blonde lady scold the British for just waving their country's flag.
pro	The EU seems to have had a very pro-internet censorship. So that is very worrisome. The less countries it has under it's wings the better.
pro	The EU should be told it's a 100% hard brexit those beggars can support themselves. no more subsidies no more military defence no more tolerance of the parasites
pro	The EU should break up a long time ago.
anti	The EU should go hard on UK. It was a stupid decision, made by ignorant old people. And for crying out loud, why was it accepted? For such major decisions a 52% is not good enough.
anti	The EU should place now VISAS for british people to cross to Europe and punish them with trade and companies sould leave the UK too leaving thousands jobless I would love to see it so now they can start looking for jobs in other countries and immigrating hahaha Karma and then be hunted and deported to the UK
anti	The EU should stand firm and the UK Brexiters should suffer for their stupidity!
pro	The EU should've stayed a trade union and not become a legislative one.
pro	The EU show themselves for the borg that they are. Assimilating countries into it's collective, replacing their currency, overruling their legal system, imposing it's political will on the population. The line must be drawn here and no further!
pro	The EU sounds like an ex girlfriend that keeps screaming ‚ÄúYOU NEED ME!‚Äù Might be a struggle at first, but it means freedom forever from a toxic, clingy relationship!
pro	The EU still thinks it has control over us. It's laughable!
anti	The EU stop corporations from forcing them to work 60 hour weeks. Stop animal testing. Stop lethal chemicals from being tested off the coast for oil clean up. Stop the UK Government from selling off the NHS so fast. Stop corporations from putting a patent on seeds & genes in livestock like in USA so that Farmers can't collect a wage. They stopped the bill to get rid of Sick pay & Holiday entitlement. They limited the amount of overtime you can do. They stopped the use of anti-flammable blood anti-coagulants being used in daily products because they care about LIFE before profits. I will forever hate all those block-headed morons who voted to leave because this country is about to go down hill FAST. In just 5 years, everything will turn to shit. The corporations will own everything, Government will have no power, the Media will brainwash with forced ways of advertising, pensions will be gone, you'll have to PAY for a GP Appointment, for the NHS visits, deals with the USA will turn farms into factories (MONSATO), the price of produce will sky rocket, exports/imports will cost shed loads more because Canada, China, India, Australia etc are so far away (duh?) & we have forever locked out our neighbouring allies all because of all these dense people who reacted on pure HATRED without the benefit of intellect.
pro	The EU unelected dictators have been trying to thwart the UK leaving from the begining.
pro	The EU want us still to remain under their control. Forget it , we are off
pro	The EU want us still to remain under their control. Forget it , we are orff
pro	The EU wants to become a fully fledged federal government with direct control over all member countries basicly turning them into states rather than countries. I want no part of that, for this reason alone if another referendum happened I'd vote leave again.
pro	The EU wants to end democracy in Europe. And when they do, the people of Europe will realise how vulnerable they really are.
pro	The EU wants to make the UK suffer, they have no intent on being fair. If you have no choice but to stay, then what is the EU really. Not a democratic body, more of a gang.
pro	The EU was a bad idea from day one!
pro	The EU was a bad idea from day one!!
pro	The EU was a good idea when it was about trade, turned bad when they decided to be social engineers and usher in 1984.
pro	The EU was a terrible experiment
pro	The EU was always about removing trade and industry from the British Isles, along with depleting our Armed forces. Now it is time to start rebuilding them back and make it that we import less from the EU. Past Governments have worked with the EU and now we need we need to reintroduce the a Treason act to stop that from taking place again.
pro	The EU was made to help the banks make a profit by lending to them on account of the Euro. The British were very smart keeping the pound.
anti	The EU was never meant to enslave the UK. Its goal was to prevent Europeans from fighting amongst one another, by stimulating internal trade. And it succeeded in that: it brought us prosperity and far less wars. Now the UK is gambling with both of these things, and there is a good chance that we will all find ourselves in the old, dangerous situation again. Are you guys happy now?
pro	"The EU was supposed to be nothing more than a group of countries joined together with the single purpose of trade & all 28 members have an equal say, with none more powerful than the other. It turned out to be a German dictatorship ruled with an ethic of fear & retribution along with a fully blown political land grab. Germany quite openly dictates to its members now ""you do as we demand or else we will punish you!"". That's a dictatorship in anyone's language!. Let's get gone."
pro	The EU wetting their pants as we speak. That UK tail is seriously going to wag the dog when it comes to talking trade with the EU. It's going to be UK rules or no rules. Onward Brittania!
pro	The EU will be much better off when the Brits leave.
pro	The EU will collapse soon. Thank God we voted Brexit.
pro	The EU will collapse soon.Thank God we voted Brexit.
pro	The EU will collapse very soon. Unchecked immigration and member dissatisfaction will ensure that. The UK saved itself.
pro	The EU will give much more If pressed properly, and rightfully so...if UK suffers, EU will suffer, and more. So go out there and tell them how it‚Äôs going to be.
pro	The EU will learn that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. The British hate the EU
pro	The EU will negotiate in the event of a no deal Brexit. They will have to. Remainers are just lazy thinkers
pro	The EU will no longer be able to cause problems in the UK anymore
pro	The EU will no longer be able to cause problems in the UK anymore.
anti	The EU will not start new negotiations. There are two choices left and one of them will happen, a new referendum or hard Brexit. If the UK holds a new referendum, then Brexit will die for the simple reason that more people have become aware of what the consequences are. If they choose a hard Brexit, it will bring economic hardship to the people of the UK, there is a whole lot more than just items costing more at stake. Think about this for a moment, Britain is far from self sufficient, it needs to import more than half of it's food sources. If you think this is bad, you haven't even seen the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Automotive industry in the UK is most foreign owned and those that are actually still owned by Britain use foreign auto parts, mostly from Germany. The Ford's Britain drive come from Germany. Farm machinery, foreign, drugs are imported from the EU, everything will become much more expensive. The EU will be economically hurt, but nowhere nearly as bad as the UK will.
pro	The EU will now play with us yet again so he's got to be strong and tell these EU Muppets that he won't be pushed around like they did to Theresa May
pro	The EU will pay for their arrogance against us Brits either give us what we want or the EU suffers when we become the European off shore tax heaven.?
anti	The EU will sink Johmson as theyy hold ALL the cards...Johnson holds Nothing EXCEPT the WTO threat and the threat of commiting suicide by crashing over the cliff. BREXITEERS.... WHAT IS THE POINT OF BREXIT?
pro	The EU will soon be called the AU. Arab Union.
pro	The EU will struggle more than the UK that‚Äôs a fact no matter what your agenda is.
pro	The EU won't even be around then. Every nation wants out.
anti	The EU won't even blink. We've always had it good with them because we were a member. Now we are a competitor they have no reason to give us anything. All this huff and puff from our governent won't make up for the fact that the EU have a much stronger hand than ours. Any short term damage done to their massive economy will be offset by their aim to take business from the UK.
pro	The EU worked well up until 2002, when it consisted of rich, reputable first world countries.
pro	The EU would enthusiastically welcome the breakup of the UK. Of course it would. And we would enthusiastically welcome the breakup of the EU and the restoration of a free Europe governed by its own people. It's coming. #Brexit is merely the first domino to fall. More will follow.
pro	The EU's 'hard won victories' were not moral triumphs against an encroaching darkness but thirty years of deceit, manipulation, bullying, false terms. obfuscation, distortion and disguise. The EU is still seeking to create a federal Europe against the wishes of the people of Europe. Those who oppose these anti-democratic and totalitarian aims are not 'populists' but democrats. There. Fixed it for you.
pro	The EU's agenda has always been the same. They want to rule us all.
anti	The EU's job is to represent their members. Now we are in competition with them. Dont expect any favours.
pro	The EU's refusal to remove the backstop should come as no surprise. We're dealing with fanatics who won't be happy until the whole of Europe is put under the yoke of a single government, and they hate the democratic decision of the British people. Let's ditch Brussels and go WTO!
pro	The EU, a cabal of leftists-globalists unelected officials is suppressing the sovereignty of nations and caused havoc on the continent. It has outlived its purpose and must soon cease to exist.
pro	The EU, in its current form, is unsustainable. It WILL collapse. Brits were smart to want out. But I fear the powers that be are desperate to hold their power.
anti	The EU, or rather, Europe is an idea of unity and fraternity
pro	The EU, should be illegal.
pro	The EU, when looking for new trade deals will no longer be able to pi#p the UK market around the world to tempt customers.
pro	The EU... is the enemy of the world.
pro	The EUrines will continue to weep, threaten and sweat incessantly. Nothing new. Brexit will progress until fully completed. Thank goodness. Out means out and so be it.
pro	The EZ is on the brink of recession. Considering the current costs to businesses for relocating at least part of their operations in the UK, it seems some would like to delay Brexit. It's the 29th March 2019, legally. Get on with it, deal or no deal.
pro	The Electoral Commission is not trusted to be impartial and a number of its leading figures have said very prejudicial things about Brexit
pro	The English and Welsh refused to bow down and cower before Brussels. Our ancestors would be proud!
anti	The English clearly forgot why we came together as EU: War prevention! Also wrecking your own economy is not a smart move, that's shown by every economic analyst.
pro	The Eu finance is going down quickly they will destroy us or try to
pro	The Eu is a Trojan horse for the takeover. By his evilness Emperoe palpadean
pro	The Eu is a criminal organisation , led by gangsters, banksters and psycopaths. Every country should leave it asap.
pro	The Eu is essentially undemocratic and run by appointees who cannot be removed individually from office
pro	The European Superstate will destroy accountability. The UK voted for freedom.
pro	The European Union is OUT¬†!
pro	The European Union is a massive bureaucracy where the people do not even get to choose if or when politicians get elected. Britain is the first to realize this.
pro	The European Union is a scam against the people. üá¨üáßGO BREXITüá¨üáß
pro	The European Union is antidemocratic and the enemy of every nation state on this continent.¬† That is the only fact you require.
pro	The European Union is toxic
pro	The European Union is toxic the United Kingdom did the right thing leaving that garbage tlnow they can have real independence and make their own laws and have a real border without having to ask EU what ot can do.
pro	The European Union sucks, it's inefficient.
pro	The European Union was a bad idea from the beginning. Great Britain did the sensible thing!
anti	The European Union will always be stronger because different national growth rates in various countries will always compensate others, so that growth and stability is ensured. Britain is alone. Without many friends.
anti	The European Union‚Äôs benefits outweigh its drawbacks
pro	The European is starting to collapse, it will be them who will help from us and we'll be a better country with out them .
pro	The European union has killed itself by expanding without the publics consent.
pro	The Eurosceptic mission will not be over until the EU withers away. Brexit is just the first step
pro	The Eurozone is one of the slowest growth blocs in the world. Sinking under a failing single currency, mass immigration, spiralling sovereign debt and a backward bureaucracy. The UK can be amazing free from the EU‚Äôs shackles
anti	The GDP of the EU is bigger than the USA, and members get to trade in that enormous single market without restrictions on the movements of goods.
pro	The German led EU project is the German 4th Reich in all but name.
anti	"The German word for it is ""Fremdsch√§men""...basically feeling embarrassed for someone he isn't aware that he or she should feel ashamed for acting like an utter tool."
pro	The Guardian has become a left wing paper which is the conduit for sensationalism, innuendo and downright lies. Fit for lining cat litter trays and bird cages at best.
pro	The Guardian is now a full blown, left wing, propagandist rag....
anti	The Guardian should take their share of the blame. Instead of engaging with the actual concerns of the working class, you lectured them about how immigration is an unalloyed good and castigated them for being racists. Now look.
pro	The IMF, Osborne, Carney etc are all basing their facts and figures on TODAY, not what it will be like in 2 years time when more of our businesses are enduced to mainland Europe to provide employment there, NHS costs have increased by 35%, not enough schools, power shortages, water shortages etc. WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE we are only wanted for our money and assetts. VOTE LEAVE
pro	The Independent continues to try and provide an echo chamber for dissolute remainers
anti	The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that Brexit could cause a sharp drop in house prices.
pro	The Irish border issue is basically the EU threatening terrorism. If the IRA want to kick off again, we, the British shall ask the yanks to get involved, with a huge military invasion of Ireland to start the war on terrorism !!
pro	The Irish fishing industry was once a major employer all around our coast. And thanks to the EU our ability to maintain a viable fishing industry is uncertain. What a ridiculous prospect for an island nation. #Irexit should follow #Brexit
pro	The Irish should leave the EU too, otherwise accept a hard border.
pro	The Islamic immagrants are destroying the Europe. And the British people don't want that. So, Brexit is reasonable.
anti	The LEAVE voters are stupid, stupid, STUPID people. Look what they did to the Pound Sterling. Never mind. Now they can live with their decision. From running huge chunks of the world to shrinking and being like Guernsey. Maybe that IS what they want. Sit at home drinking endless cups of tea.
anti	The Leave campaign was based on lies
anti	The Leave side talked absolutely rubbish last night they don't have a plan so what's the point of voting Leave we will be making a huge mistake so Vote to Remain in the EU.
pro	The Lords‚Äô(heavily pro-Remain) #EU Financial Affairs Sub-Committee concluded that‚ÄúArticle 50 allows the #UK to leave the EU without being liable for outstanding financial obligations under the EU budget‚Äù. That‚Äôs ¬£39 Billion Saved.#Brexit #NoDeal #ProBrexit #HardBrexit #Leave
anti	The MAJORITY will be HAPPY with a NO DEAL.
pro	The Mad man did it. Now Britain will no longer suffer from the dysfunctional and undemocratic EU.
pro	The Malthouse compromise or ‚Äòsort of Brexit, better than no Brexit‚Äô WILL NOT DO! It‚Äôs like ordering a Jaguar but having Reliant Robin delivered instead ...then having the dealer say ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs a sort of car... better than no Jag at all‚Äù ....it‚Äôs not what we ordered!
anti	The May/Brexit Farce - a story without an ending. About as interesting as reading a large telephone directory or watching paint dry...
anti	The New Blue Passport looks Fecking Fan-tas-tic BOLLOCKS TO BREXIT #StopBrexit
pro	The ONLY way we are going to get Brexit is to #LetsGoWTO these politicians are trying their best not to let us leave.
anti	The Old ones again fked up the youths future. The sad thing is the old don't have to live through the hell they are creating, its us, the youth have to suffer.
anti	The Only Certainty when it comes to Brexit is, BREXIT IS A MESS!!!!
pro	The PEOPLE ARE FULLY BACKING BORIS. WE WON THE WAR AGAINST THE EU , BUT WE STILL STAND WITH THE EUROPEAN CITIZENS.
pro	The PEOPLE voted, brainwashed, uneducated, spineless europhiles need to stop weeping and gnashing their teeth and accept the DEMOCRATIC result
pro	"The PILGRAMIGE OF FARAGE. ""NOT GRACE"".WE DID IT PEOPLE THIS TIME YIPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
pro	The People of the UK Voted Leave - JUST DELIVER
pro	The People of the UK Voted Leave - JUST DELIVER !!!!
anti	The Pound ( ¬£ ) HAS ALREADY FALLEN .......taking back control - Boris ?
pro	The Queen wants us all to compromise with evil...to have a pragmatic approach to the Eu communist monolith. To accept serfdom and keep our chains for the benefit of socialist elitism - to not complain as the EU sucks all the wealth out of our country and hands it to communists like China! Yeah okay your Maj - cos that all sounds lovely. CIVIL WAR
pro	The Remainer traitors are going to look very foolish a few years down the line.
pro	The Remainers would rather put their trust in people like Hollande, Merkel and Juncker? That is unbelievable. If our government fails on Brexit, or anything else, we can replace them at the next GE.
anti	The Right thing is to Remain. The intelligent thing to do is Remain. Lets vote Remain for our youngsters sake.
pro	The Socialist Fascists in Brussels are no longer the boss of Britain.
pro	The Socialists are getting scared. Revolutions are contagious!
pro	The Society is divided because of a lack of respect by the losers of a legitimate democratic vote
anti	The Sun obviously does not mention the hundreds of thousands of jobs lost because of Brexit, because that does not help their agenda. Nor does it talking of Sterling falling further, huge inflation and economic carnage and mayhem. All because of Brexit.
pro	The Sun says remoaners should stop spewing their hate, what's this litany of garbage from Kavanaugh the American stooge then if not hate?
anti	The Sun will probably continue screaming for Brexit even after this nonsensical economic suicide has been voted down by a considerable majority in a second referendum.
anti	"The Swedish populist, euro-skeptic and anti-immigrant party ""Sweden Democrats"" recently dropped their anti-EU stance because of Brexit. It simply became an untenable position to argue for a ""Swexit"" with everything that is going on in the UK. A few months before that the euro-skeptic socialist left party did the same thing. They are now talking about reforming it from within. It goes to show how insane the Brexit position has become, that the ""allies"" are seeing themselves forced to revise their position."
anti	The Tories chose Austerity while handing tax cuts to the Wealthy. Theresa admits that money is available but withheld. Why would an MP who's constituents have been deliberately denied money by the Tories accept a bribe to keep a Tory Government in power?
pro	The Tories have made a complete mess of Brexit negotiations.
pro	The Tory & Labour party leaderships are totally under the control of the EU - so of course, they will do anything to prevent a genuine Brexit.
anti	The Tory party is dead either way after this utter clown fiesta. The damage is done so I guess you'll be leaving.
pro	The Tory‚Äôs have a lot to answer for, they have destroyed every day life as we know it, look what they have done, people are sleeping in doorways, people drinking in the streets, a lot of people can‚Äôt speak properly so they take to swearing all the time, they spout dirty foul language and it‚Äôs not just young people doing it, it is clear what is happening in today‚Äôs modern life, if that is what you call it, in seems like this country is going backwards instead of forwards, caused I feel by too many people in this country, yes it‚Äôs called over population, both the Tory‚Äôs and labour have severely damaged Britain, both have let immigration spiral out of control, vote to leave, i can‚Äôt see no other way out of this problem.
pro	The U.K. Have got the opportunity to turn the last 47 years to a distant memory, forward and onward.
pro	The U.K. Needs to vote out of Eu spending too much in Europe and not spending enough like the Nhs also we need the border control back too many people coming in on a very small island
pro	The U.K. as a ¬£80 Billion trade deficit with the Eu. I believe the U.K. have got all the cards in this deal. Especially with a American quick trade deal before the end of the year. Plus deals with China / Canada/Japan/ Australia/New Zealand and on and on üá¨üáßüá¨üáßüá¨üáßüòé
pro	The U.K. has just taken its full seat on the WTO today.... üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè And it‚Äôs rightful place on the world stage. Now that didn‚Äôt take long.
pro	The U.K. is just the first nation to leave the E.U., they will not be the last. The E.U. is on the verge of imploding and only fools deny it
anti	The U.K. may not survive as a union, it may get even worse we could be heading for serious breakdown of law and order.
anti	The U.K. should stop this nonsense called Brexit, because most of the people of the U.K. do not want a Brexit anymore
pro	The U.K. should tell the EU what deal they want and give a dead line to reply. If the answer is not to our complete satisfaction we leave immediately on WTO rules.
anti	The U.K. thinks leaving the EU is like leaving a fitness centre.
pro	The U.S. market is far larger than the EU market anyway. Shouldn‚Äôt the U.K. be more concerned with negotiating a free trade agreement with a real friendly country?
anti	The UE does not force immigration on the UK. It it a lie.
pro	The UK WILL NOT ALLOW THE EU TO CONTROL anything any more, nothing. For too long, they have even told us what time it is. #Brexit #Leave #EU #SundayMorning #SundayThoughts #Brexit50p #Marr #SundayBrunch
anti	The UK all the so gets money from the EU.
pro	The UK and Germany have been propping up the EU for decades and the lazy, feckless and workshy countries have gone bankrupt and contributed noting except being a drain. on our economy.
anti	The UK and its idiot citizens are going to plunge the world into another recession. Thanks assholes!
pro	The UK bailed out its bankrupt banks remember. And with UK tax payers money. It's the UK that is the real spendaholic of the EU.
anti	The UK benefits far more from the EU than the other way around so if they leave its better for the union in a economic way
pro	The UK can move ahead with trade deals world wide, and the EU can come back to the UK when they are ready.
anti	The UK can no long influence internal EU politics, nor can it influence EU-US relations. The direction of these two dynamics which have been vital for the UK maintaining its influence is now completely out of its control.
anti	The UK can not break away from the EU. It can mess with the EU And break itself. Putin paid for both. So did the global mafia. #Brexit is a crime. Every current Tory MP is complicit. Meanwhile Nigel Farage rattles & the mafia controls the mass mood manipulation algorithms.
anti	"The UK can unilaterally stop Brexit. That's the best ""deal"" possible."
anti	The UK colonized half the world and now fear immigration...isn`t it ironic?
anti	The UK deserves this. They had an election and an opportunity to prevent this. They didn‚Äôt care. They let the conservative old minority dictate policy for long after they‚Äôll be gone.
pro	"The UK does not ""Need"" low-skill migrants pretty silly of you to state that as fact when you made so much effort to be fair during the rest of the video"
pro	The UK does not need to be in the EU to be successful. The UK was successful before the EU and will be after the EU.
pro	The UK doesnt need to be bound up with the rest of Europe.
pro	The UK doesn‚Äôt have a problem with Europe, just the EU, learn the difference
pro	The UK economy could crash and I would still support No Deal.
pro	"The UK economy has been in managed decline ever since Margaret Thatcher was removed. Funnily enough just two years after John Major took control he signed the Maastricht Treaty which locked UK into the EU's scheme of ""Ever Closer Union"" and (he hoped) membership of the Euro. Extricating ourselves from the EU morass of stifling rules and can't do's can't come soon enough."
anti	The UK government could have controlled immigration more if they really wanted to without leaving the EU
anti	The UK government have seriously underestimated just how difficult and protracted the trade negotiations are going to be. They really haven't got a clue and one can only assume they are either profoundly stupid people or preparing to fail and go for No Deal. Either way, Brexit is going to be a monumental failure.
pro	The UK had hundreds of pieces of legislation from the EU. The EU is nothing more than a Dictatorship, leading us to world governance, world army and world policing. Research it yourselves. The New Workd Order and Satanism.
anti	The UK has a very good deal with the EU at the moment and if we vote to leave we will never be able to get back to this point should we decide to re-join in the future. I personally believe the EU provides more pros then cons.
anti	The UK has been as poisoned by the Murdoch's a America has. Extremely depressing...
pro	The UK has finally gotten their sovereignty back, the EU started out as a good deal, turned into a monster that ate away at the UK's freedoms.
anti	The UK has lost its voice in Europe
anti	The UK has major problems with its industries which brexit will not solve.
anti	"The UK has now become like a really aggressive panhandler outside a liquor store...one can only pity the delusions of grandeur and persecution that drove them to this sorry state... You can ""ask"" for whatever deal you want...Canada..Australia...Timbuctoo style deal ...you'll get what the EU decides is in its interest ...."
pro	The UK has regained her liberty, freedom, & Autonomy. Now she can represent her own citizens interests!!!!
pro	The UK has the entire non-European world to trade with. You have zero need of the EU for trade. None.
pro	The UK has voted to leave......what would happen if you voted IN A GENERAL ELECTION FOR LABOUR.....BUT THE TORIES GOT IN......VOTE TIL YOU GOT THE ANSWER YOU WANT......RESPECT THE VOTERS DECITION.....
anti	The UK is a lost cause soon after leaving eu, to be a third world country run by snake oil salesmen.
pro	The UK is afloat in a sea of leftist tears! Awesome! Makes me happy to see a nation set itself free!
pro	The UK is already united. It's far better to be a sovereign middle power than have more protection as the subordinate part of a greater whole.
anti	The UK is floundering towards disaster without any effective opposition. Theresa May and her coterie of (un)-parliamentary allies has carte blanche to do what they want; Jeremy Corbyn will impotently heckle from the sidelines and be ignored. Unless? Well, that's the trouble. I can't think of a single 'unless'.
anti	The UK is gonna get really poor now. Yes the North has been neglected but what happens when even London loses its source of wealth? How poor`s the North gonna become then?
pro	The UK is in a great position to demand things as it‚Äôs such a net importer of many European goods Germany especially Does not want to loose that and if foreign goods become more expensive domestic companies can become more competitive and more money is retained within the economy enriching UK citizens more... this video is very biased
anti	The UK is leaving the EU, then N. Ireland joins the Republic of Ireland and Scotland gets indepent joining the EU. This left England and Wales alone who are likely to collapse
pro	The UK is leaving the single market, thus full control of immigration, under Boris Johnson, yes!
pro	The UK is no longer under the thumb of the EU! Hopefully the rest of Europe follows and the EU falls!
anti	The UK is now an international embarrassment. Ask for the Article 50 notification to be revoked and admit that #brexit was just undeliverable nonsense. Championing it as 'democracy' is just tosh. It was a desperate idea by David Cameron to get his party out of a hole.
pro	The UK is one of the most interesting and profitable markets in the world....that is part of the problem for the UK....there are more foreign retailers and companies selling their wares than in any other EU country
anti	The UK is only the fifth economic in the world, thanks to the EU and all their free trade agreements with other countries and the big common market within the EU. The all gone lose these advantages now.
anti	The UK is rejecting and fighting democracy.
anti	The UK is shooting itself in the face and taking the rest of us with them.
pro	The UK is the 6th largest economy in the world and we import more than we export. People would be very keen to continue to do business with us not least the Germans who will be keen we keep buying all their high quality cars. There will be trade deals.
pro	The UK is the second highest contributor of funds to the EU - apparently our exit will blow a ¬£20 billion hole in their budget!
pro	The UK isn't the same as many European countries. It's a lot more global and international. We should be making trade deals with emerging markets, like India. However, the European Commission has a very bad relationship with India and talks are almost frozen.
anti	The UK just has a right wing problem and it seems like that the right wing ppl will win the debate. Leaving the EU is not like being able to join back later on but leaving that union forever.
pro	The UK just needs to sign trade deals outside the EU to make Brussels play ball. Honestly, a clean break is the best thing that can happen.
pro	The UK left the EU due to there suicidal immigration policys
anti	The UK must be free from fascist brexit now.
pro	The UK must leave NATO next.
anti	The UK needs EU the uk cant stand on its own,if it thinks it can do business with the superpowers India,china,russia,usa, then it needs to re think because superpowers wont just give you business because they know uk is two faced
anti	The UK parliament will be sining that song next year when Scotland leaves the UK.
pro	The UK passport is an expression of our independence and sovereignty, a document that symbolises our citizenship of a proud, great nation. Leaving the EU gives us a unique opportunity to restore our national identity and forge a new path for ourselves in the world.
pro	The UK pays 55 million a day in to the EU for what ? 75% of our powers have been given to them so we can‚Äôt make our own decisions. We did not vote to be in the EU and are entitled to one . Generations have fought and died in wars to keep it from foreign rule . The EU takes more from us then we get back
anti	The UK people are going to starve of hunger, because of BreXIT - WATCH this space.
anti	The UK should get treated like any non-member nation by the EU. Similar to Russia, Ukraine, or Turkey. Trade should be on that basis. When you're out, you're out. Northern Ireland needs to choose to stay part of the UK or not. If not, and they don't want a wall between them and Ireland, then perhaps join the EU as an independent country. Scotland needs to decide the same and perhaps build a wall. Just get on with it. Hope you like Ale with Fish and Chips because French wine, Belgian chocolate, and Parmigiana are going to get scarce and expensive.
anti	The UK should have stayed in the EU
pro	The UK should leave the EU now the so called ‚Äòreforms‚Äô are a pathetic attemt at to fool the UK into staying for us then to realise we are diminished into a state on a larger united states of europe which i do not want an never will
pro	The UK should leave... Don't Trust other random people to do your choices for you.
pro	The UK should remember that their own roots are far better than those of the EU.
pro	The UK should should not be held back by the EU as there are more opportunities beyond Europe. So much more potential within the Commonwealth countries alone.
anti	The UK should stay in EU and build on it.
anti	The UK should stay in the EU, regardless of what they think about it. It's just not worth it any more to leave.
pro	The UK should stop exporting our music to the EU or charge them a tariff to listen to it. Then they can enjoy their shit Eurotrash music and all their gypsy Jazz.
pro	The UK should use its new position post-brexit to implement a more sustainable position on fishing.
anti	The UK still thinks they are an imperial powerhouse
anti	The UK used to be one of the Rule Makers. Welcome to your future... A Rule Taker.
pro	The UK wants be free by laws EU... Chuchill be proud...
anti	The UK wants to have the butter and the money of the butter and the cow. It's not possible. The UK must know that the EU it's not only a market.
anti	The UK wants to leave the EU so they can be free to make trade deals with the rest of the world, while simultaneously telling the rest of the world that any deal made will be reneged upon. The integrity of the UK has gone, who would want to be shackled to them?
pro	The UK was always a Trojan horse for American interests and objected to any type of deep integration in the EU. Overall, this is a great day for the EU. This will lead to closer integration and better European institutions.
pro	The UK was forced into the EU because kiddie fiddling Ted Heath was being blackmailed!! Ted Heath betrayed the British people because he couldn't keep 'it' in his trousers!
anti	The UK was in the EU with many opt-outs. The EU cannot let the UK now have many opt-ins.
pro	The UK was once incredibly powerful!! We don‚Äôt need anyone!!‚Äô
pro	The UK was poorer after world war 2 fighting the Nazi dictatorship. We'll be poorer after fighting the EU dictatorship. For democracy it's worth the sacrifice.
anti	The UK were given practically everything they asked for, but in the end found a union of equals an unpalatable concept.
anti	The UK were never part of the Euro, so a lot of the arguments around economic sovereignty were not relative to Brexit. The leave vote will not be good for working people in the UK unfortunately, at least that's the way it's looking now (2018). It's looking like the UK has scored the biggest own goal (fuck-up) in it's history. UK needed to remain in and reform the EU. For all it's faults, (ALL mentioned on this excellent clip) the UK's position of influence and trading benefit from being members was a much better place than where it is now.
pro	The UK will be okay the rest will die or leave the EU USA run cartel.
anti	The UK will become less influential!!
anti	The UK will dissolve because of this stupid decision, Scotland will join EU and not get dragged down with them, NI is lost and might even re-unite with the rest of Ireland, Whales is staying with England. What a step back in progress by you patriotic idiots.
anti	The UK will do as it is told. The UK is negotiating from the weaker position.
pro	"The UK will finally be able to determine its own destiny instead of the Brussels ""crew"" imposing their immigration agenda on it."
anti	The UK will have disastrous years to come.
pro	The UK will now show the rest of Europe that it is much better to be a willing participant in a close partnership than to be shackled in an arranged marriage. Democracy and accountability will always prevail over dictatorship.
pro	The UK will once again be an INDEPENDENT, DEMOCRATIC and Soveregin nation with a British Constitution & Rule of Law.
pro	The UK will sign new independent trade deals with individual EU nations and work out a free trade deal with the US that is currently going through an economic boom. Think about it, it isn't a head scratcher. It's all fine for the UK.
pro	The UK will soon become the only wealthy western nation to be outside of a major continental common market where the big player sets the rules. Norway, Iceland and Switzerland all accept EU rules to be part of the big European single market whereas Canada accepts US trade standards to be part of the big North American single market. At one point the UK will be forced to choose between standards imposed by Brussels and standards imposed by Washington or risk losing its wealth and become a new Argentina.
pro	The UK's decision to leave the EU, was probably the best thing for the EU! Now they can focus on Continental Europe. and maybe even make the situation in Greece better! Besides, the UK won't last long as a nation anyway
anti	The UK's future is to hang from the USA's coat tails and pick up the scraps the big boys have dropped.
anti	The UK's going to get raked over the proverbial coals in treaty negotiations. Trade between Britain and the Continent will tank horrendously, particularly if Britain will exercise its newfound abilities to make inferior quality products. Britons will be losing the ability to travel through the European Free Movement zone as well, significantly hampering college/job/retirement options.
anti	The UK's is going to colapse after this.
anti	The UK...The only country to impose sanctions on itself.
anti	The UK‚Äôs standards must be lowered if it‚Äôs to have any chance of competing. Brexit is one big standard-lowering exercise. Britain, the nation of no standards. It‚Äôs what the Brexiteers wanted.
anti	The US and EU will steer the global economy and the UK can only watch on.
anti	The US is a country, the EU is not. There are many in the EU trying to move it more towards being a country and a lot of people in the UK don't want to be part of it. Personally I wouldn't mind too much and voted Remain but leavers want the EU to be a free trade group, not a nation.
pro	The United Kingdom was great before the EU appeared, and it will continue being great after leaving the EU.
pro	The Withdrawal Agreement has received Royal Assent and is now law. We will leave the EU on January 31st üá¨üáß
pro	The Withdrawal Agreement is fair & non-negotiable.
anti	The aim of Brexit is to divide the UK. And to a lesser extent divide Europe.
anti	The aim of the UK, is to sit on their hands and do nothing, until the very last minute, while blaming the EU. We've been doing it already.
pro	The air smells that much fresher this morning
anti	The amount of leave voters who really don't know what they voted for is astonishing. Here's me actively hoping I can eat my words in the coming years
pro	The anti democratic EU which has been built on lies, deception and trickery from the beginning is rotten to the core with c o r r u p tion.
pro	The anti-Brexit morons don‚Äôt care if they give up they autonomy and freedom! They just want to suckle at the teat of unelected scumbag Bureaucrats!
pro	The architect of Brexit was the European union. A trading block that now wants to be a federalist military union led by Germany. glad we are out!
pro	The argument for leaving is not looking as scary as I first thought.
anti	"The argument that the EU should do what the UK asks because ""they also would be harmed"" brought us to the point we are at. The EU is negotiating on principles, not on convenience. The economic impact of Brexit is manageable for the EU and is nothing compared to the consequences of making exceptions to foundational principles."
pro	"The arguments that the EU can do things better at scale have turned out not to be true. That is to say they are plausible on their face, but now we have 40 years of actual data and we have nothing but failure. Anyone who has looked at statistics for countries outside the EU or travelled outside the EU knows, knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that the EU is not the cause of peace or prosperity. Most of the posters on /r/unitedkingdom and /r/ukpolitics haven't even left education let alone done any serious travelling outside the EU. But it's not just stagnation it's genuine failure. The euro is the chief representative of that failure, but the incapacity to reform CAP is another, the incapacity to audit budgets, the slow pace of trade deals, the over-regulation, the incapacity to secure borders, the incapacity to accept democratic calls to ""halt"" on integration when treaties were voted down. These people are not only incompetent they have taken serious and drastic anti-democratic measures by passing treaties in re-written form which the French and Dutch voted against and not permitting them to vote again. That last fact alone, even for a pro-EU person, should be sending shivers down your spine. Some Communists, few but a brave few, saw through Stalinism, they saw that the utopian promises were not being delivered. It's high time some of the pro-EU people started seeing the catastrophe they have caused rather than calling for more integration like some commisar calling for yet another five year plan. You can't just lose a referendum vote and then re-write the exact same terms and pass a treaty without a vote. It's a disgrace. Millions of lives have been ruined across southern Europe by the euro poject, anyone who looks at the statistics or actually goes there can see. It is incredibly infuriating that this is not acknowledged in the UK because most people are so detached from it. Finally, on top of the undemocratic moves they make at the top of the project just look at how pro-EU people run /r/unitedkingdom and /r/ukpolitics banning those who oppose them without providing any reason for having done so. The democratic character of the EU, from the top to the bottom, is completely rotten."
pro	The article fails to discuss the constitutional position of Britains citizens. I want out because I don't want to give away my rights to self-determination, I don't want to sign over power of attorney to a corporate and political elite.
pro	The asylum is the EU and the lunatic-in-chief is one Angela Merkel.
anti	The backlash will come‚Ä¶ You can fool people, you just can‚Äôt fool them all forever‚Ä¶ 16.8million people weren‚Äôt fooled‚Ä¶ it appears the rest of us will pay for the while our credulous fellow citizens learn the hard way‚Ä¶
pro	The backstop is simply a devious way of tying the UK to EU trade law. However, both the UK and Irish governments have stated that in the event of a no deal Brexit they will NOT erect a hard border. The EU are scared stiff of competitively priced goods from the UK flowing into their Single Market but IT IS NOT OUR PROBLEM, IT'S THEIRS! If they want a hard border let them erect one.
anti	The barriers should be coming down, not coming up
pro	The beginning of a glorious new chapter in British history.
anti	The beginning of more cuts for the poor and the destruction of the NHS. The UK had the chance to get a fair society for all and chose Tory fuckery. They threw themselves under a bus.
pro	The beginning of the end ... the eu tried everything to prevent brexit... the euro was a mistake.. the eu also for gb was a mistake..bye bye
anti	The beginning of the end of Brexit.
anti	The beginning of the end of a UNITED Kingdom. Scotland will (re)join and Irland will become stronger and more influential.
pro	The beginning of the end, for the EU. Rule Britannia!
anti	The beginning of the end, so sad. I hope I am wrong but I do think that many people do not understand how much mess we are still in and when did we lose our sovereignty... it‚Äôs a nonsense. We do most of our trade with the EU our product will not sell there if they do not conform to their standards. Now we have no say in what those standards will be..... madness.
anti	The benefits in trade and human rights are much greater
anti	The best Brexit deal is no Brexit
anti	The best Brexit of all would have been, no Brexit at all. I hope Johnson fails as he realises that being a PM is a job and not a game of truth or dare.
anti	The best alternative for all, even Leave voters: cancel the stupidity that is Brexit
pro	The best argument for leaving the EU is visualising what it will look like if it survives the next 50 years.
anti	The best deal is stopping Brexit.
anti	The best deal is the one we have now. Remain with EU.
anti	The best deal is with EU.
pro	The best is yet to come!!
pro	The best news today.
pro	The best thing Britain has done is leave the EU, should never of joined in the first place. You just wait and see.
pro	The best thing Britan can do is leave the EU dictatorship.
anti	The best thing is for MPs to admit that the main problems in the UK are entirely due to successive UK Governments and nothing whatsoever to do with the EU. MPs should have the courage therefore to vote to remain in the EU.
pro	The best thing that has happened to this country since I been alive any way Long live the commonwealth
pro	The best thing the UK has done is voted to LEAVE this corrupt EU and may all the European countries do the same only then Europe will grow stronger and all the peoples take back their countrie and power and unite and take back control from their servants..
anti	The big promises, and blah, blah, blah are now over. Britain needs more than big words. So from next week, Brits should expect action. If it doesn't happen, you'll know you've all been tricked. Tricked by big words and bigger promises.
anti	The biggest mistake we have ever made.
anti	The biggest problem I think is nobody seems to know what a post leave EU would be like.
anti	The biggest problem with Brexit is that it rides on the Conservative wagon.
anti	The biggest threat to our civilization is not evil people doing evil things but good people doing nothing. A lesson much of the West might be learning too late. Again.
pro	The biggest threat to western civilization is not China, Russia or Islam. The biggest threat is most of the Democratic Party and the entire European Union.
anti	"The biggest weakness of the case for Brexit is that it is full of imponderables and uncertainties, with no sure benefits to show for the huge disruption it would cause for the years immediately afterwards. As far as I'm concerned the case for staying in a reformed EU is the only realistic way forward. I shall be voting ""In""."
anti	The biggest worry is not so much leaving the EU. Its what would follow and I don't mean isolation I mean jumping even more in with the US and its TTIP trade games in which corporations rule. The UK political class have showed time and again how willing they are to give in to the US demands. The EU is not to be entirely trusted maybe but the US is on a road of clear decline, its congress controlled by narrow business lobbies and its democratic process largely bought and paid for. Its foreign policy ruled by its right wing obsessions. This is the really worrying scenario for the UK in particular.
anti	The bigoted thick racists won, doesn‚Äôt say much for the losers does it.
anti	The blame for even holding a Brexit referendum lies squarely at the feet of David Cameron.
pro	The blood supply to the cancer that is eating British society has been cut, now you need to work on the tumor.
anti	The bloodshed is going to come back and it's all your fault
pro	The bosses,bankers,Obama,Blair and Cameron want the UK to stay in.. Enough said! Time to set ourselves free, Vote Out!
anti	The bottom line is that the U.k. would be on the way to becoming a third world country if it were to leave the E.U.
anti	The bottom line is, Dumbledore would vote remain and Vernon Dursley would vote leave. I know where my loyalties lie. #EUref #VoteRemain
pro	The box I crossed in the Referendum was Leave not Deal.
anti	The bravado of pro Brexit British is getting annoying. Just pull the bandaid and see how much you will bleed.
anti	"The brexit bird brains seem to think that anyone that doesn't agree with them is ""Establishment"". Boris is anti establishment, apparently."
anti	The brexit case was always based on talking rather than facts and evidence.
anti	"The brexit should have NEVER happened, people were horribly misinformed. Around 40% of people who voted ""Leave"" have said now that they would never have voted that way if they knew what it actually entailed. The entire vote was fraudulent"
anti	The brexiters might have won, but they have lost a United Kingdom.
anti	The brexiters, all beliefs and no facts.
anti	The british exports to the EU reached 260 billion euros in 2018 and the imports from EU 350 billion euros. A no deal brexit means rising cost for tax and handling up to 10 % of value, means the prices for british consumers will rise up to 10 %. The forecast for a no deal at the chanalis very difficult, long queues could be seen. That could cause total damages to companies both sides of the chanal waiting for parts for produktion.
anti	The british people will suffer because they are so gullible, only read the headline but not the small print that follows it for example
anti	The campaign to #Rejoin starts today.
anti	The case for brexit was a story of lies and fictions
pro	The central committee of the EU , like all central committees , is growing increasingly insular and paranoid . It will happily inflict misery on the people of the EU and it's businesses just so that it can wallow in it's dogma . If the UK is so insignificant and is bound to suffer without the elite , mighty and perfect EU pulling the strings why don't the EU ' leadership ' just smile and wave goodbye ?
pro	The chaos isn‚Äôt from leaving, it‚Äôs from people going behind everyone‚Äôs back and making sure we don‚Äôt leave
pro	The choice is straight forward. We either leave the EU or we accept within 20yrs, becoming a part of a future UCE (United Countries of Europe). Lets get OUT before it's too late.
pro	The city of London has been the financial centre for Europe for many years before EU was dreamed up,
pro	The clean break of Brexit returns us to a functioning democracy again, where the people creating our laws are the same ones we hire and fire, a somewhat fundamental aspect of a fair society.
anti	The closer we come to the Greek tragedy that is Brexit, the more horrifying it is to behold.
anti	"The closest thing that the EU has as a goal to ""scrapping nations"" is scrapping roaming fees."
anti	The closing statement assumes a short term economic impact. That may not be the case so it isn‚Äôt a solid foundation on which to build a pro brexit argument
pro	The collapse of the EU has begun. Can‚Äôt wait for an independent Britain again
anti	The collapsing UK economy is hardly surprising given that the UK is soon to cut itself off from one of the world‚Äôs biggest markets, the EU. The only solution is to dredge Ramsgate harbour even deeper.
anti	The complete lack of policy for leave is glaring. Let's just leave without a plan.... trust me it will be great
anti	The concequences of brexit are going to be terrible‚Ä¶
anti	"The core points of the Brexit campaign are: to stop giving money to the EU when we could spend it instead. To stop foreigners coming in and taking low paid jobs and houses, also using the NHSTo generally make Britain more economically independent and able to set terms on trade and employment law. To return Britain to the way was in the past. Independent, self governing and financially strong. My problems with these: we pay money to be in a club, like being a member of a Gym, you pay money to use the facilities. Now imagine we get a vote on the gyms direction - want more hot yoga or kettlebells, we get a vote . The assumption that ""Norway and Switzerland do it alone"" , in fact they also pay to use the facilities but they don't get any say on policy. We do. EU migrants - if we still want full trading access to the EU region the migration laws are the exact same. If the UK had the same net EU immigration rate as Switzerland, it would mean nearly 400,000 more EU migrants a year! Any workers in Britain pay taxes, and that rightfully gives access to the NHS. To dictate trade terms with (lets say) China or USA, we must determine relative economy values. The balance of trade. Currently we trade on equal terms with them, as part of a large trading bloc. If we separate then our trade ratio gives us terrible negotiating power.""make Britain Great again!"" the 50s, 60s and 70s in Britain were socially grim and our financial situation was very dire. We now live in a global mega corporate world, financial institutions now run public policy across borders. we are at the mercy of corporate interests but It's easier for them to bully a loner than a gang. Rupert Murdoch has admitted exactly this - he can bully the UK govt. but not the EU. Tl;dr - Remain"
pro	The corrupt EU is collapsing in slow motion
pro	"The cost of another referendum will be an astronomical ¬£140 MILLION pounds. How dare Mr Cable, a deluded politician, advocate wasting tax payers money. Also, how dare he try and disenfranchise the 2016 referendum votes of 17.46 million British people who voted to LEAVE the dysfunctional EU. Britain will be LEAVING the EU at 2300 hrs on 29th March 2019, ""Freedom Day"", Long Live Brexit."
anti	The costs of Brexit are all down to remainers  David Davis was in charge of the first negotiation - a brexiter! Then Raabid Dominic, then Stephen Barclay. Brexit has been run by Brexiters all along and it‚Äôs Brexit that burns the black hole in our economy.
anti	The could already.. The EU has the most trade agreements in the world. That's also why the UK could benefit and grow to become the 5th largest economy in the world. And remember: over 50% of the export, goes to the EU. Its a really big market, on the doorstep. Why would you risk to lose it.
anti	The country are divided down the middle. But I'm getting sick of the brixiters say anyone who doesn't agree with them are disloyal traitors. I love the UK. I was born here. But why can't I express my views about brexit without being told I'm a traitor?
anti	The country is not coming together again. We do not accept Brexit. We do not celebrate this fiasco, nor do we see a single opportunity ahead in separating ourselves from the EU and the wider world. Remainers are now rejoiners. We're not going away. Our place in the EU will be restored in short order.
anti	The cowards did it on a weekend to avoid a drop in the value of the pound.
anti	The currency falls to its lowest since the 80s. But hey, change is good...
pro	The current setup with the Euro is unstable, it benefits some countries more than others, it leads to migration from poorer areas to richer ones.
anti	The daily mail should be ashamed of themselves encouraging the grey market to vote this way. The hard working youth of today will be paying for this editorial genius for years, bravo the daily mail .
anti	The damage may be done, but stopping Brexit will cauterize the wound.
anti	The damage will be done and irreversible... In those circumstances we place our hopes wherever we can...
anti	The darkest day in Britain since Suez.

pro	The day is coming when Britain will rule Europe.
pro	The day of a new future has dawned. WE will make of it what we will. The British character has never lacked the passion or capacity to deliver and we certainly won't be lacking now. Happy Independence day to all.

anti	The day that lies and manipulation won over truth.
anti	The day the UK elects its own version of Trump seems a foregone conclusion doesn't it
pro	"The decision of England to leave this EU was and is correct, especially for humanitarian reasons. The EU is increasingly developing into a fishing pond for international return hunters, an Eldorado of early capitalism. In particular, since the introduction of a genetically ill currency as a means of unification, only the major capitalists have been able to accumulate unprecedented wealth, while 90% of Europe's people have plummeted to a ""prosperity level"" as it was before 2000. It was the time when the two emissaries of big capital owners, Draghi and Juncker, fully determined the directions of politics, while national politicians and parliaments sanctioned all, what these both presented Now the EU are deliberately denouncing the British of self-interest and blocking all attempts to unite for an orderly Brexit in order to prevent a thorough paradigm shift in favor of the people of Europe what a Blessing on the vast majority of its people in Europe would be. Not only the yellow wasps in France, but all people in Europe would have to fight on the streets and against an order that promises an unworthy existence as manipulation mass for the overwhelming majority of people. The Germans emigrate to 250,000 / a in non-European countries. But should we all leave our Europe to capital to drain its last resources?"
pro	The decision the British people made, was, as always for us, the right one.
anti	The decision to put it to a vote was a monumentally terrible decision, done as pure posturing because everyone expected the vote to fail. It was wrong to put it to a vote, and I'd argue the best course of action to stay in the EU notwithstanding the vote. I don't even support a second referendum because that just legitimizes the idea that such a thing even should be left to the masses. We have professionals running the government for a reason. The masses are asses.
anti	The delusional fantasy is turning into a nightmare for brexiteers. Shame many decent people will bear the burden casued by liars. The liars will be ok and that's the tragedy of it all.

anti	The dignity, decorum and good humour shown by the EU members is humbling, indeed embarrassing, compared with the Brexit stupidity exhibited across the U.K.
anti	The direction for Britain is cultural obscurity ,mixed with political unrest when Scotland separates and brings an end to the idea of a United Kingdom and a end for the Union Jack,such a loss,such a pity.

anti	The dumber you are, the more conservative you are.
pro	The e.u is a covert Vatican inc. globalist/imperial project, which is why the treaty of rome, is called the treaty of rome, and not the treaty of Europe. The devil being in the detail ! a counter reformation using mission-creep through a trading union to political union , into a neo-feudal imperial world order !
anti	The economics experts warned us, the business leaders warned us, the sensible politicians warned us. The general public used it as a referendum on immigration. They said stuff you. Now, we're all going to be stuffed.
anti	"The economist: ""Brexiteers note that 90% of world growth will be outside the EU over the next decade. Yet the government‚Äôs own analysis finds that the combined benefit of free-trade deals with America, Canada, Japan, Australia and other big countries would add less than 0.5% to GDP, a small fraction of what will be lost through more trade friction with the EU."""
anti	The economy is stalling, the pound is falling, inflation is rising and we haven't yet left. The UK is tearing itself apart right now because of the stupidity of the Brexit 51%
anti	The economy started tanking years ago due the Brexit vote you clown.

anti	The end of the UK as we know it....Thanks to fake patriots
anti	The end of the world is going to be so interesting
pro	The enemies of Great Britain have done a great job in perverting the minds of the younger generation. It is just what the Nazis did in Germany from the late 1920's in controlling the minds of a whole population. No wonder the young people voted against Brexit! Because of Left Wing teachers in Comprehensive schools, patriotism has become a dirty word and British history has been rewritten. They have succeeded in brainwashing the younger generation. This programme is an offence to any historian and should never be seen again.
pro	The enemy are the pro-eu Britsh politicians - and they hide across the lib lab con. We know who they are now!!! Things are going to get very rough for them.
pro	The entire strategy of remoan is to make the leaving process as difficult as protracted and as tiresome as possible. Most of the remoaning is coming from the Europhile media and politicians from within the legal profession. The sort who love Germany more than Britain.
pro	The equivalent of 19 smaller EU states have just walk out the door taking our money and our fish with us. Isn't it time we told the EU what they can and cannot have. The writing is on the door for this corrupt EU project. Once again it is us, the UK that had the guts to take on Germany and we won again.
anti	The establishment won‚Äôt let Brexit happen,Mrs May will be richly rewarded at the end of all this mess,then she‚Äôll resign and sail off into the sunset, and the British people will have been well and truly shafted once again.
pro	The eu are desperate to keep the UK paying into their failed club...
pro	The eu can vote on whatever they like... We are off :)) Out of this corrupt, anti democratic, perk ridden, political amalgam... And it feels GREAT !! :)
pro	The eu has removed more pointless rules and regulations than any other government or organisation in the history of the world.
pro	The eu is a cult of drunks drunken with power run run as fast as u can dont bekieve these lies cause no one has a crystal ball
pro	The eu is a disease...
pro	The eu is an Undemocratic bureaucracy
pro	The eu is on a trajectory towards being a federation of nations with elected politicians as mouthpieces while the 'Commission' rules the roost. Britain wanted to come back a bit closer to democracy. There are many 'co-operations' that we do as member states that could continue if everybody wants them but if not we might just import less stuff.
anti	The eu is probably one of the best things that happened in Europe. The only problem is it's highly inefficient due to politicians.
anti	The eu is stronger than ever now. No one wants to leave now they have seen the absolute shambles of Brexit.
pro	The european union nazis, just wont let england be free. They will do anything to stop brexit.
pro	The eurozone Is slowly but surely failing, Since its introduction in 2002, the euro had consistently underperforming in comparison to the U.S. dollar and the British Pound. Bring back the ¬£Punt
pro	The eussr will not and cannot survive, it‚Äôs crumbling. All they can do is to bankrupt even further the remaining states.germany is almost financially drained, the French will certainly revolt in the micron attempts to impose further taxes; Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy are already bankrupt and can offer not a euro more. Those which are left are financially incapable of meeting the huge chasm about to appear in the euseer finances. Bye bye eussr ...
anti	The fabled new trade deals might sound a little more positive if it weren‚Äôt for our failures to negotiate with the EU. If we cant do that properly, exactly how well will will do against the trade negotiators from the US, China or India?
pro	The fact EU law overrides UK law is reason enough to leave
anti	The fact is the UK has always had very strong voice in the EU, so I wonder Why they want out
anti	The fact that people think that Brexit will be beneficial to the UK economy even at this late stage shows just plain ignorance.
anti	"The fact that pro-Brexit commenters on here call this very fair, balanced video ""fear mongering"" shows how deranged the Brexiters are"
anti	"The fact that you're treating our European friends as adversaries shows just how badly we've gone wrong. We do indeed ""have a different economic profile"" from our neighbours, as you will soon find out when teh reality of Brexit starts to become obvious to even the thickest Brexiter."
pro	The fact the EU likes the deal means it's a shit deal. Can you send us Trump to sort this mess out please?

anti	The far-rights attempts to destroy the UK continues. Fuck BoBo the Clown, fuck Brexiteers
anti	The farmers voted leave can kiss good bye to farm Subsidies from the EU they'll get Jack sh*t from the Tory government post #brexit
anti	The fault for this Brexit mess lies fairly and squarely with Cameron for his weak leadership in failing to deal with the growing anti-EU feeling that developed within his party when he became leader. He should have launched a root and branch clear-out of all eurosceptic MPs, and reformed local Conservative associations that were moving in a direction to campaign for UK withdrawal from the EU
pro	The fear and anti brexit narrative is the reason why the brexit vote won. We are not stupid.
anti	The fight to #StopBrexit is over but the fight for our values continues. Our campaign created a powerful movement for an open, tolerant and outward looking Britain. We will continue to fight for those beliefs
pro	The figures don‚Äôt lie.. The EU has been a disaster for jobs and this country, it‚Äôs beyond me why the uninformed Remainers want to stay shackled to the declining EU..
anti	The final nail in the coffin for a country which once was the ‚Äúgreatest‚Äù empire on earth.
pro	The first of many countries to leave once they all watch Britain's wealth and economy explode and problems dissolve.
anti	The first vote was based on outright lies that only became clear once the process to leave got underway. Attitudes have changed, because people can now see what they‚Äôre getting into. Not having a second vote would be a disastrous failure of government.
pro	"The folk in the member states are now seeing how afraid the companies in their states are of UK companies becoming direct commercial competitors. They are, like the ""elite"" of the only trading bloc in the world with delusions of grandeur, running scared."
anti	The freedom and sovereignty brought by Brexit are as fake as the BigBen recording played outside Number 10 last night at 11pm. May God have mercy on our souls.
anti	The freedom to smoke is bad for public health, likewise Brexit is bad for Britain.
anti	The funniest thing is that if you think things are going bad for GB, wait until the day after they truly left the EU. That will be funny
pro	The future is bright the future is Back to how things where 47 years ago before this aberration.
pro	The future is bright...the future is Brexit.
anti	The future is certain: it‚Äôs awful
anti	The future of UK lies in eating chlorinated chicken and paying 1000 pounds for a vial of Insulin. Good luck with that.....
anti	The future of the Brexiteers: Daddy , all the foreigners are gone why haven't you got a job
pro	The globalist elite are the only people who lose with this change.
pro	The globalist scum will do anything to ensure they succeed
pro	The globalists tried to ignore the will of the people and undo a democratic vote but in the end the people won this round. The fight against globalism is far from over though
pro	The globalists tried to ignore the will of the people and undo a democratic vote but in the end the people won this round. The fight against globalism is far from over though.
pro	The good people of these lands voted and won - we won.
anti	The good reasons for having been a member of the EU: free movement, enhanced protection of workers‚Äô rights, strong regulatory standards for foodstuffs, enhanced bargaining power in trade deal negotiations. These four, powerful concepts spring to mind unbidden. I could probably add another four without a great deal of reflection. And these are/were actual, substantial benefits that we‚Äôre casually discarding as if they have no value. Good reasons for leaving? Not at all apparent. Apart from windy words and hopeful generalisations from Brexiters no-one - not a single commentator over the past three and a half years has come up with a set of reasons for leaving that stands up to examination.
anti	"The government has employed hundreds of commercial lawyers on ¬£3000 a day each, trade consultants on similar and there are not enough. Whitehall needs 30,000 extra civil servants and cannot recruit them. 34 new regulatory bodies are needed to duplicate the work that used to be done by your so called ""bloated bureaucrats in Bruxelles"". Also, more customs and immigration staff will be needed, while if we leave the Customs Union, the roads around the ports and airports will become lorry parks."
pro	The governments have done nothing to control the abuse of cheap labour until the Brexit vote
pro	The great Brexit watershed was the 2019 general election. An 80 seat majority changed everything,
anti	The hard line Brexiteers are a deluded dangerous gang of fanatics.
pro	The hell with the corrupt global socialists; God Bless the UK and the US.
pro	The idea of Not leaving.. should be taken off the table. Or we'll live to regret it
pro	The idea of other countries making laws that you have to follow seems a bit insane
anti	The idea that 52 percent of people can vote for the destruction of a country and that the other 48 percent have to go with them is laughable.
anti	"The idea that European states will make individual concessions to the UK's advantage as they ""fight over the scraps"" seems to be simply the latest iteration of the ""they need us more than we need them"" line of argument"
anti	The idea that brexit puts the G back in GB, is plainly, obviously, and completely wrong.
pro	The ideal of a single state is fine - helping to compete on the world trade but we've got a communist Russia instead of Utopia
anti	The idiotism of Britt's nationalism. I wish them well, but doubt it gonna happen. So my condolences to sane part of England!
anti	The ignorance of UK Racist Conservative Party will bring down the UK. Just because they have the stupid idea the immigrants are the problem, when in reality the immigrants kept UK a float.
anti	The incredible damage done to UK by Brexit is becoming irreversible.
anti	The inescapable logic of the UK leaving a supranational project is for the separate nations of the UK to also go it alone. Brexit was fuelled mainly by English nationalism, and Brexiters have to own the natural outcomes of their logic.
anti	The inevitable end of Great Britain, although of course some are still in denial.
anti	The irony of Brexit.... If we stay within in the EU we can benefit from Nissans decision to produce Xtrails in Japan thanks to their new trade deal. Brexit doesn't make sense anymore... It never did actually.
anti	The irony of celebrating brexit with champagne.
anti	"The irony of the brexiters celebrating being free of ""unelected bureaucrats"" by signing God Save The Queen is astounding #brexit"
anti	The irony of this is that the less well educated in places like Sunderland who voted for leave will be its principal victims. Cameron needed to go he was entirely responsible for this debacle but that chump at the head of Labour needs the boot too. Watching the leave talking heads last night all cheerfully assuming the rest of EU is going to give our cake and eat it was funny and depressing. They don't seem to understand basic math. Yes about 50% of Britain's imports come from Europe but that's divided between 27 countries while our reciprocal 46% comes from one.
anti	The irony, of course, is that those who will be most negatively affected by Brexit - without mobility, wealth, or truly valuable skills - are the ones who most ardently pursued it.
pro	The is going to be a punch up with the eu sooner or later ! So when the media tries to scare you with anti Boris/Brexit propaganda (again) just remember no matter what they say, our Island will prevail and tough times ahead are a small price to pay for securing freedom for our children. (not long ago the same price had to be paid for with rivers of blood , we were lucky it only cost us a vote).
pro	The is music to our ears. People like you aren't welcome. Be a REAL patriot and go to Blackpool or skegness instead. Spend your money there.
pro	The land of hope and glory. Sing it everywhere. I am proud to be British.
pro	The last thing they want is a reasonable deal, because they want to block Brexit. Its devious, dishonest, nasty and twisted, but thats exactly the way the remainer politicians and media are playing it.
anti	The latest YouGov poll suggests that more people in the UK believe Brexit is bad, rather than good for jobs
anti	The leaders of the pro-Leave side made a lot of promises ones they could never actually hope to keep because no one expected Leave to win. So they didn't actually have a plan.
anti	The leave party are all just a bunch of empty expectations and stupidly high patriotism. Britain is a country that needs the support from the EU, we all flourish economically when part of a larger group. Not even in the first few hours and the value of the pound has dropped, the prime minister is retiring his position and the remain voters are admitting defeat to the security of future generations for this country.
anti	The leave voters are ALL IDIOTS!!
pro	The left are really racking up the losses now....Scottish Indy ref, EU ref, 4 general elections, 2 EU elections.....no but the problem is us we just keep getting the answer wrong!!!
pro	The left is so desperate to stop Brexit they are grasping at straws now
pro	The left wing bbc are pissed
anti	The legal equivalent of unbaking bread.
pro	The legal suites will now pursue remainers. Its starting. Crowd funding to hound these undemocratic unpatriotic self interested Blaiites. Targetting them at their constituencies who want to remove the. QUITE RIGHT. They have asked for it.
anti	The lesson here is that the EU is fully prepared to do what it takes to protect it's member states in a crisis. Far from being a fatal blow that could cause it to fragment, brexit is providing precious unity and an opportunity to demonstrate the value of internationalism to it's members.
anti	The level of Leaver ignorance continues to astound as the clots fail to appreciate that their Commander in Chief is Mr Protectionism when they point fingers at the EU.
anti	The lies and deceit posted by brexiters seem to reflect those coming out of the Mail, Express, and Sun, telling reflection !!!
anti	The lies of the #Brexit billionaire press are perverting and undermining our democracy. Those orchestrating these lies must be prosecuted and jailed. If new laws are required then so be it.
pro	The little guys actually got their country back!! Wonders never cease!!
anti	The little nation packed full of reactionaries with delusions of past grandeur will get what it wished for and well deserves, it will finally stand alone.
anti	The longer this goes on the more the ridiculous this senseless brexit actually is after 40 years of economic unity
anti	The lorry incident a few days ago indicates there is much more important work to do than fiddling about Brexit whilst pissing away tax money.
anti	The lot of them will miss the EU gravy train especially the Kinnocks
anti	The lunatics have taken over the asylum. Some time in the future, which I won't see, we'll go crawling back and ask for remittance.
anti	The madness of Brexit is when 1 country thinks that 27 countries need 1 country more than 1 needs 27.
anti	The main and most important reason why BREXIT happened is purely down to the ignorance of the majority of voters. Normal/average man in the street is not up on the complicated political and economic strategies, schemes, plots, benefits etc of remaining or exiting the EU....The propaganda won...but only just. They should have set a minimum win percentage gap of say 10% to ensure a definitive win margen, something significant...not just a few percent....I live in Germany and the negitivity towards the UK post Brexit is disgusting. I would in my position have voted to remain initially, from a selfish perpective, however I am glad the the few percent win counts...Brexit will cause a few more countries to exit too, the EU will change its thinking and hopefully learn from this...We will grow stronger with a return to global trading and re-establishing our links with our commonwealth.
anti	The main problem is this: Brexit has seriously compromised the UK's ability to influence its future. It no longer has a seat in the political organization setting the economic rules all its neighbours (and about 50% of its own trade) abide by. It has destroyed whatever goodwill it has left among these neighbours (public and political), mostly because of ill thought out rhetoric by its political leaders. It is now isolated and vulnerable in a world dominated by huge trade blocs.
pro	The main reason people voted for leave was to reclaim our sovereignty
pro	The main reason to leave is to avoid the EURSS. Europe is not a country (at least after 400AD when it was called Roman Empire), and will never be, unless will be cancelled all different cultures, languages, laws, traditions, foods, and so on. Nazis tried to do it and they failed. Communists tried to do it and they failed. Americans tried to do it with natives, and they succeded, through a genocide of locals and importation of slaves and low paid migrants.
anti	The main reason why UK beaches aren't still covered in sewage is mainly down to EU regulations. That's reason enough to stay in.
pro	The mainstream media choosing to pick out stories about how Brexit is 0ly affecting us
pro	The major pro is not accepting the ideology of the EU and it‚Äôs future plans for deeper integration. The U.K. never had an appetite for this roadmap
pro	The major problem not mentioned above is the EU bureaucracy, arrogance, jobs for the boys, gravy train, mayhem with the Euro, youth unemployment in Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal and Eastern European countries, and the enormous amount of ¬£billions to support this folly. The undercurrent is forever turbulent between all EU countries, and much by way of unrest in the making.
pro	The majority of Americans wanted change and voted Trump, the majority of British wanted change and voted Brexit a lot of other EU Countries are not happy with the EU but can't afford to leave, once Britain has left it will give others the strength to follow. the EU is doomed, the flow of migrants caused by the German chancellor has killed it, she thought she was being clever but she has only caused hate, she will go down in history as a failure
anti	The majority of brexiters are old traditional man.They don't realize what they vote for, their kids don't want Brexit to happen and it shouldn't happen, because it will negatively affect not only United Kingdom, but Europe as well. Especially no deal Brexit, it will be disastrous! It's also unfair 90 year old man to be in parliament and to make decisions! Britain should make a second referendum and more young people should vote!
pro	The majority of newspapers, including the popular ones (Sun, Mail, Express, Telegraph) were all harpy screeching in favour of leaving
pro	The majority of people who voted BREXIT want our democracy back. The EU are trying to do what Nazi Germany failed to do in two World Wars, dominate Europe.
anti	The majority of people who voted to leave are old stupid racists by the time we leave the Eu Half of them will be in their graves by the time we leave the Eu Why couldn't they have thought about the youth
pro	The man himself said it! Don't fall into the trap of Project Fear! #VoteLeave and believe in #ProjectHope @DCBMEP
pro	The map isn't accurate, Northern Ireland wasn't completely blue, many constituencies voted leave.
pro	The mass immigration from Eastern Europe to the UK will switch to Ireland and maybe then Ireland will get a party who advocate for #Irexit. ALL Irish politicians are sickening eorofiles. Well done to the UK, #Brexit was the great escape.
pro	The masses will not vote again WE WON!!!!!! They betray us they will suffer the consequences you only have to look at France right now, it won't just be chaos but their will be strikes Why should the working people continue to work paying taxes that keep them in a life of luxury???
pro	The massive, colossal white elephant in the room and the reason many people voted to leave is that the EU is essentially a country, an undemocratic one we didn't at any point agree to be part of.
pro	The media are also very bitter and hurt by the leave vote because they did their level best to get a remain vote and failed miserably - so you can understand the outpouring
pro	The media has gone into overdrive with the anti brexit propaganda, Joseph Goebbels would be very impressed.
pro	The media is really going all out to scare the crap out of the British public into thinking Brexit is bad.
pro	The media is still very biased ... It's time to support brexit
anti	The migrant crisis in the EU. You mean those poor kids we wont let into the country to be with family ALREADY HERE. Instead of some Russian Mafia's whore collection(1000s of children by themselves have already vanished)? But even so your going to give up a united Western Front in Europe in because a few of these refuggees might be terrorists? Well congrats you just let Terrorism win.
pro	The migrant crisis is gonna end Europe...
anti	The minute you define brexit in meaningful terms, it loses its majority.
anti	The moment I'm old enough to i'm leaving this shitty island. I love it when the younger generation don't get a say in things that will massively effect the future when it will affect us the most yet heres Mary with at least 5 years left in her being nostalgic with patriotism deciding the future of our country when she's not even going to be around long enough to be able to see it.
pro	The monumental mistake would be staying in and losing the United Kingdom. Cameron is a traitor to his Queen & country
anti	The more Brexit seem is made to seem good, the less people buy it.
anti	The more I hear from brexit supporters the more I realize they are generally either mad, ignorant or have looked for scapegoats their whole lives to blame for their own pathetic failings.
pro	"The more I read of ""Remain"" arguments, the more I come to doubt whether Remainers have any grasp whatsoever of economic theory or practice"
pro	The more inward looking the EU become, the more they will stagnate. The sooner that the UK adopts a trajectory away from the EU orbit the better.
pro	The more seriously I have focused my attention on the European dimension, and the more informed I have become on EU structures and goals, the more Eurosceptic I have grown.
anti	The most corrupt, incompetent government in our history has just broken up the country. I'm sure that we should try and blame this on Jeremy Corbyn.
anti	The most disappointing independence day in history
anti	The most enthusiastic and ill-informed Brexiteers will suffer most by Johnson‚Äôs hard line policies. They have been deluded and duped by mendacious propaganda and they will show their disgust when Brexit fails to live up their expectations, and fail it must and fail will.
anti	The most extraordinary act of unsollicited self harm any nation has ever committed on the tune of snake oil merchants and charlatans.
anti	The most extraordinary thing about #Brexit is that we don't have to do it. Every other national emergency I can think of, we had little choice but to deal with it. This one could be avoided.
anti	"The most overwhelming feeling of disgust I ever experienced was the morning after the referendum. I'd gone to bed confident remain would win and woken up to the news... After spending a couple of hours watching the news and rushing to get to work on time, I got off the bus near my office around 9am, feeling stunned. Just at that moment I saw a group of drunk middle-aged men and women decked out from head to toe in ""Vote Leave"" and ""Take Back Control"" propaganda smiling and shrieking with laughter. I don't think I've ever felt so much hatred towards complete strangers before... That day I started looking into work opportunities abroad and now I live in Germany, with a far better standard of living than I had in the UK, so I guess I'm doing pretty well. I sometimes feel kind of bad watching the Brexit car crash from outside though, not being able to do anything. Survivors guilt I guess!"
anti	The most useless PM and government ever. The only benifit from brexit is that the Tories will be out of power for decades üòé
anti	The move only favors the rich not the common man.
anti	The naivety of the BREXIT lot is staggering. Do they not realise that most of the world is ready to get their own back and that includes the Commonwealth who are loyal while the Queen is alive but just watch the change when Charles is King. We will become nothing. To be honest we are not important to the rest of the world but the EU is. Like it or not and I am a eurosceptic but the only way forward is to stay.
pro	The negative comments on brexit are the brain washed masses desiring to return to their unelected euro overlords.
anti	The north of England is definitely neglected
anti	The number of nurses from Europe registering to practice in Britain has dropped by almost 90 percent.
pro	The odds are very poor with the EU's current¬† leadership and baked in ideology
anti	The older Brits born before 1955 voted for the Brexit, vs the younger born after 1975 that voted to remain. The elders will die before the youngers have to deal with the ramifications.
pro	The one thing that Europe isn‚Äôt is democratic, and that is the main reason that the UK wants out. We never were asked, and never wanted to join a Political Union, we asked to join a trading union.
anti	The only country to impose sanctions on itself happy Brexit
pro	The only deal on the table is a No Deal.. May Out.
pro	The only future of Europe are free, sovereign and independent countries. This artificial form, that has been named misleading as union, is totally wrong and destructive.
anti	The only good Brexit is No Brexit.
pro	The only lunatic idea is that there is any option other than to leave.
pro	The only mistake the EU made, .was to exist !.
pro	The only mistake was ever joining
pro	The only mistake was that we did not walk away 3 years ago.
pro	The only ones that can be scared about this are the young ones. It is easy to misguide and lie to them. Britain did very good on their own. Their young need to be taught this.
pro	The only ones to blame for the entire fiasco is the whinging whining remainers that would rather serve the EU than the people they are suppose to represent.
pro	The only option for Britain to be a free sovereign nation is to leave the EU. The alternative is to be governed by an unelected foreign dictatorship.
anti	The only people I directly know who want brexit are ill educated relatives. I don‚Äôt know how much they know about brexit but it there seems to be a correlation between how educated someone is as to what there stance on brexit is.
pro	The only people shooting themselves in the foot are the EU
pro	The only people who don‚Äôt appear to understand what the EU are trying to do to us are our parliament of naive, infantile politicians who seem to take everything at face value.
pro	The only politician i trust 100% is the messiah! The one and only Nigel Farage. Bring on the Brexit party.
anti	The only question is, how hard will the UK cry when nothing that got promised happens and it all just gets worse?
anti	The only real reason why Britian wants to leave the EU cause they can't stand having so many brown people in their country.
pro	The only real solution to the 'eu problem' is to announce we will move to WTO with immediate effect. Then once we have the eu's attention- THEN we can start negotiating. The eu really believed that Brexit would have been cancelled by now- they even told us they were ready for Brexit 6 months ago.
anti	The only single market I want to live in is Tinder.
anti	The only thing saving Britain now is common wealth countries. Watch the pound go further down
pro	The only thing that will bring the EU to it's senses is NO DEAL, LEAVE NOW!
pro	The only true Brit is a Brexiter!
pro	The only true Brit is a Brexiter!!
anti	The only way out of this mess is to revoke article 50 and remain part of the EU. It‚Äôs the only outcome that will result in anything other than a disaster for the people of the U.K. If we remain part of the EU at least we have a seat at the top able and can try and put things right from within.
anti	The original Brexit vote was made on the basis of incomplete or false information. Now that people have all the information, hold another referendum and see how the people vote now.
anti	The original referendum was based on LIES and was a total blind vote, all Tory moves are corrupt we have never and never will have a say what happens in our Country under Tory dictatorship
pro	The part I find perplexing is how British Remainers over the last nearly-three years clearly want Britain to fail badly, all because we said no, not to Europe, but to a foreign body of bureaucracy growing stronger in its attempts to rule the continent. OK, so you're upset we're leaving. Fair enough. But the level of vitriol since day 1 of losing has been an eye-opener. It's going to take a lot of work pulling this nation back together again.
pro	The parties in parlement conspire to stop brexit. I dont believe for one moment that no deal brexit will be to the disadvantage of business, the government is just busy with scaremongering.
pro	The people already voted on this. I guess it's totally cool to tell the voters to go fuck themselves.
anti	The people comparing this to any war of independence are dense as lead. This act of xenophobia and global opportunism is typical from the UK after they fail at something, or become economically insecure by their own horrible policies. They do it all the time, since forever. This tone deaf move, however, may prove to be their downfall, socioeconomically. Nationalism is just fear, insecurity, and bigotry disguised as a mission, or an honor; its not the opposing force to globalization, rather globalism, which really isn't a thing. Economies create dynamics, people don't go where they aren't herded by demand. We shall see if the british can, yet again, cause the problem, not take responsibility for the problem, be upset there are consequences for their problem-causing, abandon the problem all together, tell others the problem came from foreigners, or Brown and Black People, monetize and politicize the lies, cut and run, write a few text books where they were basically heroes, and absolute gentlemen.
pro	The people demand freedom from the EU.
anti	The people driving the train of Brexit are deluded immature fantasists. Especially our priapic PM. Even if Brexit could have had a happy conclusion in an alternative universe, in ours it‚Äôs the monstrous spawn of Brexit Boris, Farage, Raab, Patel, Fox, Francois, IDS, Leadsom, Truss, Gove, Redwood, Cummings, Widdecoombe, Rees-Mogg and so on. I hope that list is illustrative enough.
pro	The people have beaten the establishment. The real winner tonight is democracy. And I am someone who believes we should be pro-Europe, but not the European Union
anti	The people have been lied to - they had no intention of carrying out the result. Stop Brexit - Leavers and Remainers unite against the political class and the lies in their party manifestos and referendum nonsense. The political class have lied to and misled the people. Stop Brexit. Blame the political class.
pro	The people have finally decided.
pro	The people have spoken and it must be respected.
pro	The people have voted , if we do not leave it will be a massive betrayal and insult to democracy !!!!! we do not want a continual dilution of our race/ culture we need control back of our borders
pro	The people in the UK gave an answer in the Referendum, over 2 years ago. The answer is still the same.
anti	The people of Britain do not know what they are doing
pro	The people of Europe are already now starting to voice their desires for their own referendums. The EU was a political project that never really had the mandate of the people that matter most - its citizens. A new Europe will emerge from this eventually , one where states work in partnership, not force laws, directive, rules, down each others throats from a central power.
anti	The people of the UK didn't have all the information before the first referendum vote. Not everyone was engaged on this topic. Clearly now, everyone knows everything that is at stake whether you are leave or remain.
pro	The people of uk now a free independent nation have voted to take back control of our waters.
pro	The people vote and if they vote wrong then we do it again until they get it right. - Democracy
pro	The people voted for Brexit. They have to leave the EU. If Parliament doesn‚Äôt vote to approve an exit then Britain isn‚Äôt a democracy.
pro	The people voted for it. The government is doing its damndest to avoid doing what the people who employed them asked for. That‚Äôs disgraceful. On the subject of Brexit, itself, I would strongly favor it if I were a citizen of the UK. I can‚Äôt imagine tossing national sovereignty out the window and handing my life over to unelected foreign bureaucrats who don‚Äôt give a damn about my rights.
pro	The people voted for it. Why is this even a discussion?
pro	The people voted in a majority to leave the EU. Parliament is stalling - WE WANT OUT OF THE EU - NOW!
pro	The people voted to leave and leave we must and then it will be up to us without the eu interference and the Lisbon treaty is un acceptable.
pro	The people voted to leave and no deal is the best way
anti	The people were promised a Rolls Royce, instead it seems they‚Äôll be getting a 30 year old used Lada Niva ... they should be asked if they‚Äôre still okay with the Lada!
pro	The people who are voting remain are the kind of people who do art and drama at university
anti	The people who run this ‚ÄòUnited Kingdom‚Äô do not represent all of us. I‚Äôm sorry for their behaviour, I wish we could continue to be in the EU. I‚Äôm a European at heart, they can‚Äôt take that away.
anti	The point is not that it's impossible. The point is, that it's just a rather bad idea to do so because it has negative consequences because it creates a legal vaccum.
pro	The point is we're gone anyway, we never signed up to become a state within this EU one nation mash up, junkers only today claimed Ireland as the EUs, let the EU become one nation, let them try and crush peoples nationalities, brussles are petrified of nationalism or as they like to call it populism, let's get back to a simple trading agreement if possibly and the EU can push off with the one nation vision!!
anti	The politicians that pushed for brexit should be put in jail for convincing the public that it would be easy with no consequences. May could never get a better deal, no one could! What bargaining power does the UK have when the EU hold all the cards?
anti	The poor of England and Wales voted to turn on the elite by backing a campaign led by people equally elite and even more right wing.
anti	The poor will get poorer and the rich will get richer. Smh UK. Now trade deals get more expensive making food and recourses more expensive. The people who voted Brexit really only looked at how it would benefit them.
anti	The poorly educated...they don't realise they voted to be poorer.
anti	The pound will drop massively if we decide to leave.
anti	The pound will fall. Forget higher exports due to a low quid. Who outside Blighty wants Marmite? And what else is there to export? Imports will increase in costs though, causing inflation. Who will suffer the most? The ones with a tight budget already.Thanks Boris. Highly appreciated.
anti	The price of Brexit is the destruction of the United Kingdom.
anti	The price of a small parcel from Germany to GB will go up 7 EUR tomorrow. Thanks for nothing, Brexiters.
anti	The price will be paid by many younger generations who won't enjoy the benefits we had or they'll need to have loads of money to have some of those privileges.
anti	The pro-brext idiots just got bored of being down voted and unsubscribed.
anti	The problem here is that lots of Brexiteers are in full on denial. They seem to have the memory of tadpole when it comes to bad news about Brexit.
anti	The problem here is that we miss out on a lot by leaving, and the EU lose by us leaving. It's a lose-lose, and if you have to spend 3 hours defending a deal you made after some of your MPs left, It's not a good deal!
anti	The problem is Britain thinks they are more important than they really are.
anti	The problem is that Brexiters largely understand very little and what they do understand is distorted rubbish. Therefore hard Brexit sounds doable. The more you dig and find out how our economy has become tailored to the EU do you realise how destructive it‚Äôll be to leave so aggressively. It‚Äôll mean millions of jobs for several years.
anti	The problem is that all these people who voted for brexit, not thinking about all the consequences, are now being shocked that the consequences go beyond immigration and funding for the NHS. Not saying that everyone who was pro-brexit didn't anticipate all the consequences, but most of them didn't....
anti	"The problem is that everyone saw how Brexit was a bad idea... right after they voted ""yes""."
pro	The problem is that the remainers never will have a better story to tell.
pro	The problem is that we have several countries with very different economies, sharing the same currency. We saw in 2011 during the Euro crisis how much some of these countries struggled (PIGS).
pro	The problem is the EU leaders are not elected by the people and cannot be removed even by the MEP's. This is a huge problem. As the EU becomes more like a Communist - federal super state I really worry that all the things that made different parts of Europe great will all be watered down as every thing is rationed and every part of Europe becomes the same.
pro	The problem isn't Brexit, the problem is Remain politicians trying to derail Brexit.
anti	The problem we have is that the idiots who pushed for Brexit totally overlooked the fact we have a land border with the EU and an international treaty commitment not to have a hard border - duh!! Makes you wonder what else the numpties could have forgotten to think through
anti	The problem with Brexit is how it was won. Instead of it being properly thought through right at the start it was effectively hashed together with clearly little thought with what to do if the public actually voted to leave. It should have been clearly defined that IF people voted to leave then there would have been another referendum on how people wanted to leave, which would have also included an option to remain, because the reality the UK has found itself in is somewhat different to what people were sold at the time.
pro	The problem with Europe is the inflexibilty of the EU itself.
pro	The problem with a 2nd ref is that it COMPLETELY undermines the intelligence of those who voted Leave, which ironically, was the issue during the entire campaign. My ballot paper simply asked me if I wanted the UK to leave the EU, yes or no. It didn‚Äôt ask me if I wanted a deal or not. It was very simple and straightforward, and to suggest that Leavers were ‚Äútricked‚Äù and ‚Äúlied to‚Äù is deeply insulting. We knew EXACTLY what we voted for.
anti	The problem with idiot Brexiteers like this guy is that they think that this is a negotiation between equal parties. This is not a negotiation between equal parties. The EU has the ability to dictate the terms and there is nothing the UK can do. They can cut their losses and do without the UK very well. There is nothing that Britain produces that some other EU country doesn't produce.
anti	The problems we have in the UK are self-inflicted not by the EU. Leaving the EU will not alter the stupidity of our political class and their economic failures. The economic benefits of exit are probably marginal either way, and the only real benefit will be emotional for those who are strongly nationalist. Most of the arguments for and against are hysteria or lies.
anti	The process of leaving has turned into a sad display of vindictive amamosity towards people of different opinion, it's obvious that the UK has become a poorer place, morally, socially and culturally.
pro	The prodigal son may be the only sole survivor post the political and economical Titanic that is the European Union.
anti	The prospect of Britain running out of clean water within days of a no-deal Brexit reportedly convinced Michael Gove to back Theresa May‚Äôs deal.
pro	The purpose of the EU may well have originally been to counter that power, (though I doubt that to have been entirely the case), but, in any event, as any structure grows larger so it grows less accountable and more corruptible.
pro	The question now is does the E.U. want to show goodwill & still have a very close relationship with us as a staunch ally & trading partner post-Brexit OR do they want to simply be nasty & vindictive towards for having the temerity to leave the E.U.! From what we can see, these Brussels bureaucrats clearly want to adopt the latter option in also sending a strong signal to any other member country who may also consider leaving their highly autocratic & unaudited organization anytime in the future. They clearly hate democracy & the fact we had our referendum despite pretending otherwise - so when people can see how they are behaving like playground bullies, it is simply staggering that there are still many Brits who want us to retain our E.U. membership!
pro	"The question was ""is the UK a nation?"" The people answered...""Yes it is""."
pro	The quiet people of our country rise up against an arrogant, out-of-touch political class and a contemptuous Brussels eliteBy Daily Mail Comment
anti	The rational world looks on..and they are ashamed for many Brexiteers. I'm afraid to say, but the overs, the uneducated and bottom feeders of the UK (with a tiny sprinkling of those who should be brighter) did this.
pro	The reaction to seeing the union flag by that hateful bigoted old bint was priceless. She opened even more eyes to the authoritarian dreams of the EU. So thanks.
pro	The real face of the comunist EU.
pro	The real problem facing Eurotrolls in 'post-Brexit' Britain is the construction of a coherent sentence.
pro	The real purpose of the EU is to generate a multicultural SUPERSTATE, populated by `serfs' with no national identity or pride
pro	The reality of course is Brexit is far from complete, the crucial phase is only beginning now. And while I acknowledge there is a sense of Brexit fatigue, people will have to stay awake for most of this year.
anti	The really scary part is that once we are no longer protected by the EU we'll be left with a Tory government hell bent of dismantling our right, protections and social safety nets.
pro	The reason British people don't understand Brexit is because that's what the EU does best utter chaos and confusion.
anti	The reason it happened at 11pm is bc that is midnight in Europe. If we were pushing the EU around - it would have been midnight UK time - surely? We have taken back nothing - just made fools of ourselves and weakened the UK for 100 years.
anti	The reason it was not a great advance in democracy is that the Leave vote was not a vote for anything. It was against over-controlling laws, which were mostly misunderstood because of the misrepresentations of the Brexiteers. Let us find a way to improve our situation, not just pull everything down.
anti	The referendum result was the revenge of the retards. I have always said that not all people should have the right to vote.
anti	The referendum was a disaster for the country. The leave side was partially funded by large amounts of questionable money and manipulated by foreign interests. It was full of lies and deception and promised unattainable results. It was also a disaster as it was dreamed up to try to heal Tory divisions. All it revitalised was racism and exceptionalam and stupidity and the whole kingdom has been ruptured
anti	The regulations that come from the EU are good for UK citizens on the whole,such as workers rights and consumer rights
pro	The remainers are extremely disrespectful people!
pro	The remainers are going to feel really silly WHEN the tyranical EU implodes and Britain doesn't go down with their ship.
pro	The remainers are shocked that the government is taking up the advise from the people.
pro	The remainers should just move to a EU nation
pro	The research funding one is wrong, we give more money to the EU than we receive
anti	The rest of the EU has learned how to work together, while UK's hasn't. And it seems UK people have a blind eye towards global economics and politics.
anti	The rest of the world is now showing its 'I told you so' face
anti	The rest of the world must be wondering why the UK is celebrating its relegation to the 2nd Division.
pro	The result of the United Kingdom European Union Referendum of 2016 wont change!
anti	The result will be disastrous for the UK. The UK government has no plan for a post Brexit and none of the right wing fanatics who in influenced the vulnerable of the UK citizens had a clue.
pro	"The result would still be ""leave"" and by a bigger majority, now that the public have seen the tatics used by the EU."
anti	The result? You‚Äôll ‚Äòfeel‚Äô like you have more control and sovereignty, but it will be illusionary.
pro	The revolution has started : Let's continue with Denxit, Swexit and Nedxit.
anti	The rich will get richer
anti	The right to live and work anywhere. This has benefited me greatly.
anti	"The sad part is that the people who voted ""leave"" will never understand the negative effects of Brexit in their small, homogenous, insular worlds."
anti	"The sad thing is even when the economy has utterly collapsed a large section of the electorate will just blame it on ""fake news"" or some other rubbish. Just as they disbelieve in climate change, experts, and anything resembling reality."
anti	The sad thing is the debate up to the referendum will be dominated by the right wing media and the already very wealthy who have little to lose financially from an exit and simply want fewer immigrants. It'll be the ordinary worker who will suffer big time from this exit.
anti	The saddest part for me is that I don't think it is was people's hate towards the EU that ultimately tipped the scale towards Brexit, it was people's love for the NHS.
anti	The saddest time of my life. I am 70, I've lived a lifetime with peace in western Europe thanks to European integration. Look back over preceding decades, centuries to see how miraculous that is. The movement was based on the idea that peace happens when the parties have a vested economic interest in it, it has succeeded 100%. We should be at the heart of it, not skulking off-stage.
pro	The sadness of the speakers is delicious. Congrats on your freedom, UK!
anti	The same as what seems to me to be the view of a large majority of EU citizens. It's a dumb decision that will benefit noone in the end, and I hope the UK government will see reason and turn it around before it's too late.
pro	The same economists who forecast disaster if we voted leave just said the UK would be the fastest growing G7 economy.
pro	The same way the Russian sanction work. Buying from the dutch farmer via his African sub company... U think BMW and Audi stop selling cars in UK ? That's unreal. The companies will force eu to work with UK. Because you're statement works 2 ways. A tremendous amount of people would lose jobs if UK market will be closed. As for UK they go from a 500 million highly regulated market to a 7.5 billion free for all. That's a good deal
anti	The same way you Brits (and the rest of the world) laugh at Americans about electing Trump, rest assured that the rest of the world is laughing at you and Brexit. And we have been since June of 2016.
pro	The scaremongering hasn't worked....you'll see just like after the referendum....life will go on! The media and their buddies in the EU were pushing the scare stories of paying for visas......a clean WTO Brexit will be wonderful and save us 39 billion pounds!
anti	The scenario of Greek default, immigration crisis and BREXIT must appear to some Brexiters a gift from heaven
pro	The secret of change is to focus all your energy not on fighting the old but on building the new
pro	The side with the fewest seats still turn up and represent their constituents. All are represented in a true democracy.
pro	The simple fact is that upon leaving the EU we will be in an unbelievably strong position
anti	The single market is a beautiful thing. It's not too late to reconsider.
pro	The single most important thing you will do this week, don't make excuses on why you couldn't vote make the time, unless you are one of the brain washed stay campaigners, to you I say stay at home and do the UK a favour. VOTE LEAVE!!!!
pro	The small setback for the EU from a No Deal Brexit will be worth it in the long run for the EU instead of making concessions which poke holes into the EU27 borders and market.
pro	The snowflake remoaners are holding vigils hahaha!!!! I'm absolutely loving it. They are in complete meltdown. The sinking eu ship will sink with all hands within 5 year's.
anti	The so called 'unleashing' stuff could have all been done whilst in EU. Such deliberately misleading rubbish. We already had the power/sovereignty to do all that stuff, including manage immigration as part of EU. There was no leash.
anti	The so-called ‚Äúunregulated low skill migration‚Äù isn‚Äôt keeping wages down, it‚Äôs the Bosses looking at their profits and offering employment at low wages that‚Äôs keeping wages low. Stop pointing the finger of blame at those at the bottom, and instead point the finger of blame at those controlling the companies.
pro	The sooner the EU ends, the better
pro	The sooner we are out of this corrupt club the better. I hope their whole project goes down the toilet.
pro	The sooner we leave the better! !!
pro	The sooner we leave these drunken idiots the better for UK
pro	The sooner we're out the better.
anti	The state we are in regarding brexit is all down to the incompetent tory government.
pro	The strange thing is not that Britain is leaving EU - it's that we ever joined.
anti	The strange thing is that often Leavers are so proud of staying in UK for their holidays they don't even have passports.
anti	The stupidiest thing Britain has ever done, after picking Giesela Stuart as one of their politicians. Hopefully the negotiations with Britain will fail, so Britain might have a valuable lesson.
pro	The success of the future global economy will require flexibility, adaptability and control of its own destiny. Brexit gave us everything we needed.
pro	The tears and whining of Remainers has been beautiful today. You lost, get over it losers
pro	The territory of fascism creeps ever nearer. 'Brexit is completed.
pro	"The thing I find really sad about this whole leave v remain is, now that it's happened there are remainers who actually want the country to fail and fall into misery, just so then can turn around and say ""told you so"". They would somehow see that as a victory, that is beyond sad."
pro	The thing about paying into the EU budget, we no longer have MEPs, we have left. There is a continuing relationship but significantly different. We should only be paying a small amount into the budget to cover trade continuing currently etc. Not anything like the full payment.
anti	The thing is that no one is gonna protect them if some country goes to war with them
pro	The things the European emails were saying is the reason why we left. They don‚Äôt get it
anti	The thought is unbearable. Affecting me badly..Brexiters still have their eyes closed dreaming of sun lut uplands while we'll be isolated & left in some situation like a war zone
anti	The thought of leaving the EU is keeping me up at night and giving me palpitations. I'm not sure I'm hardy enough to cope with all of this. Please can't we stay in.
anti	The time has come to sit back, and watch Brexit crash and burn.
anti	The time spent on the two sides of the argument is pretty much representative of each side's argument strengh. From an economic standpoint, if you leave you will destroy your country, so there isn't much to say for Brexit.
pro	The toxic eu is a dictatorship that we voted to leave, thank the heavens
pro	The trade deal they can get with the United States will benefit the UK BIGGLEY!!! Well done Brits!!! And congratulations.
anti	The trade deals seem to be a problem. The border between Ireland and Northern Ireland is another sticky situation. The whole thing doesn't seem like it was well thought out.
pro	The trade unions used to exist to serve the working class. Now they're in favour of cheap foreign labour and being under the kosh of a corporate/political unelected entity.
anti	"The trend will continue to move in direction of ""a rethink"" as one by one the ludicrous promises made to the electorate get holes blown through them. The trend willbe reinforced as the UK sinks into prolonged stagnation and the EU economy builds up momentum. It's as if the British millstone has been removed from around the EUs neck and the clouds of negativity created by Brextremists and their Eurosceptic forebears dissipates and gives way to a sunlit upland. The European project will continue and once again the UK will repent having cut its self off from its neighbours. Of course things may not turn out that bad if the UK comes to its senses and stops behaving like a bull In a china shop in its Brexit negotiations. It needs to replace it's Brextremists with shmooztremists."
anti	The triumph of small minds liars and racists. So much to celebrate!
anti	The true stupidity of Brexit, it that it is obvious to even the meanest intelligence, that it unwinds a century of civilisation.
anti	The truth is that pulling up the drawbridge and quitting the EU will not enhance our national sovereignty
pro	The truth is there was never any intent on their part to honour the decision to leave. These are grade one A holes we are dealing with.
pro	The truth is we voted to leave so lets live in a democracy and doit and there is nothing you can say to us that we haven't heard so go on lets make Britain great again or are all you remainers traitors to democracy!!!!!
anti	The truth of the matter is if you voted to leave you essentially want to live the rest of your life just surviving and without any ability to build an international business and produce real wealth for yourselves. That or you are over 65 and are deluded by the illusions of nationality and sovereignty.
pro	The two richest countries in Europe arent(wisely) in the E.U.go figure that
anti	The two things guaranteed to enrage Brexiters and their super childish populism - logic and common sense.
anti	The two thirds of immigrants are from outside the EU and the government has a full control of the numbers. Why haven't they used their power to do something about it? Now we are leaving the EU and putting hundreds of thousands of jobs on the line.
anti	The ugly face of Brexit.. racism and xenophobia perceived as acceptable behaviour..
anti	The uk created this mess, not the eu.
pro	The uk government is the laughing stock , the uk people want out of a failed globalist rip-off project ; ]
pro	The uk had no power over the eu, it did as it liked , it leaked money like it was going out of fashion and was demanding control of member nations, none of that is good.
anti	The uk is a joke.
pro	The uk own a third of the world on our own we could do it again
anti	The uk will suffer a lot because of brexit
pro	The ultimate goal of the EU is the creation of The United States of Europe. Staying in the EU means the end of the UK, as it would be relegated to nothing more than a district council.
pro	The undemocratic nature of the EU political union is the clincher for me. Dictatorships never end well, and as a citizen of the country that founded parliamentary democracy, I resent out govt being handed over to an undemocratic foreign power. We do not need to be in a political union to trade with European countries, nor them with us.
anti	The uneducated, who naturally tend to have the poorest paid jobs, voted en masse to leave. We will have crashed out of the EU and entered a deep and long recession.
anti	The usual Brexiter delusion.
anti	The utter ignorance of Brexiteers is staggering. Even now.
anti	The vast majority of young people in the U.K. (Especially those living in the cities) did not want to leave the EU whereas the vast majority of the older generation did.A bit like middle American Trump voters/middle England Brexit voters.
anti	The victory of total idiocy over reason! Sad to attend such events without being able to stop them. Perhaps also in the United States ... I must feel what an educated democrat must have felt in Germany in the 1930s.
pro	The volume of propaganda and the attempts to keep Britain in the EU via the back door are all factors in producing a poll result which in itself is used as a propaganda item. Check out what just happened in Italy and it reminds us why we need to leave.
anti	The vote for Brexit is a vote against Europeans, against European culture and European values.
pro	The vote was OUT! Goodbye EU!
pro	The voters will never forgive you, if you don't deliver BREXIT.
anti	The voting system is flawed, and this is a perfect example of it. Simply voting 'yes' or 'no' is complete nonsense. People are completely misinformed and unaware of the legal conditions and the consequences accompanying a simple Yes or No.
anti	The war has not been won. A battle has been won. And democracy is the loser.Already looking forward to rubbing brexiteers noses in it when we finally win the war.
pro	The waters will be stormy in the near term, but with sound navigation, a bright future lies ahead.
pro	The way I see it, the more governments that exist, the better
pro	The way the EU is set up is incredible. If we stay in, we will ultimately lose our sovereignty and any meaningful democracy. Yes, we'll still get to vote in elections to make it feel like we're in a democracy, but we won't have any real influence over those who really govern us in Brussels.
pro	The way the EU works at this point is very undemocratic
pro	The way the younger generation have been brainwashed in school I can imagine we'll be back in it within 10 years.
pro	The weakness is clearly immigration.
anti	The whole Brexit is absolute waste of time and money (so far ¬£40bln) to appease people (majority of them racists) that can‚Äôt be appeased anyway.
anti	The whole Brexit saga is, in my view, one big, terrifying leap in the dark.
anti	The whole Brexit situation has really shown how bad politicians are at their job
anti	The whole Brexit situation has really shown how bad politicians are at their job. They can't even agree to agree talks about coming to an agreeable compromise.
pro	The whole EU will soon fall. That‚Äôs what I see watching from America. The EU sucks.
anti	The whole farcical debacle would be funny , if the whole fiasco wasn't so tragic .
anti	The whole leave campaign has been based on lies. What absolute charlatans. Why on earth would you trust the Garagistes?
anti	The whole of UK needs a rude awakening anyway
anti	The whole of the brexit mess is all planned all along, frustrate it confuse the voters so they want back in.
anti	The whole point in Brexit was to leave the Eu, now not only are we not leaving the Eu but we're losing right to have a say in the Eu. No matter how you look at this it's bad for Remainers and Leavers.
pro	The whole rotten corrupt system will soon collapse thank god we are out June 23rd our Independence Day
anti	The whole thing is just so unpatriotic. Trump and Putin are rejoicing. We've stuck a knife in the heart of the most peaceful and forward-thinking alliance in the world, in which we were a leading voice and power. We were winning as a nation, people wanted to join our society and way of life. It's the frightened ones that couldn't get their head around change so just wanted to shut the door that are unpatriotic and have let down the country. It's not much of a stretch to say the UK (led by the Tories) have done a pretty shameful act.
pro	The widespread British view of the backstop shows a deep distrust of EU institutions and their role in protecting the interests of member states and maintaining a level playing field.
anti	The withdrawal agreement is dead in the water and cannot be reopened. An extension of Article 50 is likely to be thwarted by the likes of Poland, potentially, and Spain if they don‚Äôt get their way over Gibraltar. Crashing out on March 29th would be obviously catastrophic economically. Worth noting that a large number of major businesses set up in the UK because it was in the EU. Many would clearly move out if the UK crashes out resulting in huge job losses.
anti	The words of a leaver shocked me thoroughly this morning! Blaming the consequences of their own vote on the EU! Leavers, wake up and realise that this is the reality of what you voted for. If we leave the EU we are no longer in a position to benefit from what they have to offer if we do not contribute. You can not have it both ways!
pro	The working class of this country should remember as long as we have open borders your wages will be suppressed the last 10 years has proved that
pro	The world is fed up with this extremely boring Brexit saga. Get it done and move on, please.
anti	The world is safer with the European Union. Assuming the EU stays together, I give it 20 years until Britain wants back in.
pro	The world outside Europe - The Real World would love to see you throw off the shackles of a moribund misplaced European experiment. You have so much to gain by taking back the helm of your own ship of destiny. Cast off the stiltifying straight-jacket of Brussel's control. Then you can get your house in order, contol your borders, decide who you want to live amongst you and start trading with The Commonwealth progressively again and put the GREAT back into Britain again. Other, commonsense nations will follow you, like Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway you could even reform EFTA again. Go on, You know you Want To.
anti	The world will roll over puny UK. You think the trade giants like the US and China will make better deals with you than the biggest trade block in the world : the European Union? Numbers count!
anti	The worlds gone crazy haha, we are one big meme
anti	The worry is that now that the EU doesn‚Äôt protect us any more, America will walk all over us. We will become the 52nd state (‚Äòisrael‚Äô is the 51st) and that will be disastrous.
anti	The worst aspect of #brexit is not economic, it is the empowerment of the dregs of society and the 'normalisation' of their rancid identity politics.
anti	The worst part is how incompetent and misinformed/deluded our own government is dealing with Brexit. They are clueless and are just riding on a wave of optimism and patriotism. It will and is crashing and burning and we are only a month into the Brexit process.
anti	The worst part of this is the complete lack of rational logic-based debate in politics, all replaced by vacuous slogans, lies and scaremongering. Brexit has taken on a cult-like status, to be dogmatically believed regardless of cost. Something like the flat earth society or creationism springs to mind... No basis in common sense or logical thought..
anti	The younger the individual, the more likely they voted Remain. It's time for Remainers to look around and determine if maybe their future lies on the continent. Berlin, Amsterdam, Barcelona and so many other cities big and small will welcome you. Brexit is going to have long-term negative consequences for Britain but the people who voted for it will be either dead or enjoying their retirement checks for it to make a difference to them. Come live in a country where the Murdoch media machine doesn't exist. You won't regret it.
anti	The youth of Spain are not against the E.U. They do not blame the E.U., but the Spanish government. You know nothing about Spain and continental Europe.
pro	The ‚Äúpeople‚Äù have already had their say and they chose to leave!
anti	Their economy will crash simultaneously with ours. Putin must be getting tired of celebrating.
anti	Their economy will suffer massively.
pro	Their loss not ours. Rule Britannia!
pro	Their not called refuges their called economic migrants. The people who are coming to places like Germany are going for the fact that they can just sit on befits and make kids. The real refuges go to the nearest country to them NOT to the uk.
anti	Theiridea of courtesy is constant threats. Out of EU Titanic.
anti	Then we should have it so, should we not? After all the Only thing Brexit will do is ... Make the Rich-Richer and the Poor-Poorer. All of Our Human Rights will be a Distant Memory as will Our Precious NHS and Our Infrastructure too.
anti	Theory shouldn‚Äôt really as that will backfire tremendously bad for the British economy. Most likely it will also bring with it a new referendum to Scottish independence as most Scotish seem to be pro EU.
anti	There are 3 million EU citizens living in the UK who are still qualified to apply, and may be sick of being discriminated against.
anti	There are 48% of us who voted against this shit
pro	There are 6.5 BILLION other people to do business with other than the E.U...
anti	There are SO many problems ministers should be getting on with right now - the climate emergency, our housing crisis and fixing Universal Credit, to name but a few. But trying to deliver May‚Äôs dangerous, blindfold #Brexit has brought the work of government to a standstill.
anti	There are aren't any Muslim EU countries
anti	There are brexiters complaining about¬† people coming from Kenya to our country on stolen EU passports is somehow the EU's fault!! Come on brexiters, get some sense of reality!
pro	There are many dangers Britain may yet face, but it will be all the better for facing them as a free, independent, and self-governing nation.
anti	There are many people who, for what ever reason, did not get the opportunity to vote and the vast majority of the people I know who voted leave, didn't fully understand the implications
anti	There are many people who, for what ever reason, did not get the opportunity to vote and the vast majority of the people I know who voted leave, didn't fully understand the implications.
pro	There are many potential positives, not to mention the fact that Brexit has really got government and business thinking about how the UK can boost exports and become more competitive.
pro	There are more risks staying in the EU (more bailouts, more immigration of UNSKILLED workers etc.)
anti	There are no benefits of leaving the EU without a deal.
anti	There are no good personal Brexit stories. And there won't be any
anti	There are no opportunities of Brexit, zilch, none, nothing, how can you expect any normal person to embrace a deluded fantasy?
anti	"There are over 3 million peoples who work, pay taxes and live in UK and you just ""forgot"" to ask them if they want brexit. They are EU citizens. Do you still think you won the referendum?"
anti	There are plenty of people who voted to stay in the EU who don‚Äôt have degrees. The problem with trying to articulate the reasons for voting leave is that there aren‚Äôt any, the leave campaign was solely based on meaninglessness slogans and emotion - not facts.
anti	There are so many similarities between Brexitors & Trump voters. Their anger can not be extinguished even when they get what they want.
anti	There are some really nasty people in the Tory party. And this guy is one of the nastiest!
anti	There are times when I fervently wish Britain would exit the EU because I would love to hear the Eurosceptics arguments when it finally dawned on them that the EU was not responsible for the UK's dire housing problem, its creaking NHS and lack of social mobility thanks to a two-tier education system that works against the poor.
pro	There are too many restrictions in EU law. The huge EU regulatory system limits the free trade agreements between the UK and other countries such as China, India and the United States, as well as the UK industry. After leaving the EU, the UK can avoid these regulations and better prepare for long-term economic benefits.
anti	There are uncountable benefits of being in the EU. One is the unprecedented level afforded by the freedom of movement rules for EU citizens, which over a million Brits are benefiting from right now.
anti	There are undiscovered Amazonian tribes who have done more to prepare for Brexit than we have.
anti	There are zero upsides to Brexit. No dividend. Only massive downsides, economic damage and other losses, alongside years of turmoil as we work to renegotiate 45 years' worth of trade agreements. It staggers me that people can be so ignorant and naive. I see there's now a propaganda campaign underway on social media, spreading egregious lies about the future of the EU, in preparation for a 2nd ref
anti	"There can be no ""healing process"" when people have had their futures stolen from them by liars and cheats."
anti	There can be no orderly exit because Brexit is fundamentally nuts. You can't apply ordered thinking to something which is actually insane
anti	There goes car manufacturing, fish and farm exports. I am sure those little Brexit towns that relied on these industries will be very happy with it. Their Happy Brexit day celebration in 2021 will surely be out of this world.
pro	There has been a total concerted effort by all areas of the media to savage the Brexiteers views. We have faced biased accounts and I am disheartened by some politicians who have no confidence in the British people to go it alone. Why do some people still need to take rules and orders from the EU? British politicians need to begin to think for themselves and not rely on unelected bureaucrats.
anti	There hasn't been any economic think tank who expects a prosperous outcome out of Brexit.
pro	There is a little benefit to staying in and Brussels has shown they don't give a fuck about compromises. Only sensible option if you actually want to help our country.
anti	There is a lot you can do as united but not lonely
pro	There is going to be a lot of trouble unless the Brexit we voted for is delivered. It was a BINARY choice, stay or leave. Not leave in name only. This will be the end of the Tories if the vinegar titted one is not careful and the LAST thing we want is comrade Steptoe running the show.
anti	There is no Armageddon after Brexit. Just more poverty and secession movement.s Another proof that humans are irrational.
anti	There is no `coming together' , I want to disassociate completely from Brexiteers and everything they represent.
anti	There is no country on the planet that has less right to complain about immigration then England. They literally invaded every continent on the planet
pro	There is no democracy in the EU. They openly admit it. And still people want to remain.
pro	There is no f**king EU money!!! It's taken from us each year and then half is returned to us with conditions attached to how it is spent. Oh, and we have to be grateful to them!
pro	There is no law that says we must pay 39 billion. We don't need Europe and it's time to leave
anti	There is no plan for making Brexit work. Brexit was a project that was weaponised by Boris johnson to become PM, now that he has finally succeeded, he's boxed himself in. His whole credibility now rests on making a success of what was always a wild gamble based on nothing but grandstanding, thin air, and the backing of one maverick economist (Minford) who nevertheless admitted that 'Brexit will decimate agriculture and manufacturing in the UK' and he said that as if it was a good thing.
pro	There is no price that is compared to freedom and independence. So Leave is better
anti	There is no question in my mind that a 'Brexit' would deal a significant blow to the E.U.'s strength and resilience at exactly the moment when the West is under attack from multiple directions.
pro	There is no reason why we cannot become Western version of Hong Kong or Singapore (I wonder where they learned their commercial expertise from?).
pro	There is no such thing as a ‚ÄúNo Deal‚Äù. It‚Äôs a Brexit Deal. It‚Äôs a democratic deal. It‚Äôs an independence deal. The No Deal is a EU con trick a Theresa May created scaremongering.
pro	There is not going to be another referendum. It is simply out of the question. We are leaving the EU and there is nothing anybody can do about it.
anti	There is nothing wrong - for the UK- in being in the EU ! It does us great economic good and little harm.
anti	There is one simple reason Brexit is going to be a disaster for the UK. And that is the fact that the EU has to punish the UK. If the UK does well out of Brexit, other members are going to think leaving is a good idea. Poland, France, Italy... Support for leaving the EU will rise. But if Brexit is disaster and the UK gets screwed, other countries will think twice about leaving. The UK is already going, so there's no reason for the EU to make the deal favorable to the UK. Its in the EU's interest to screw the UK. So they will.
pro	There is only one poll worth considering, the Referendum we had in 2016.
anti	There is only one sure fire-way to solve the crisis - that is to REMAIN!¬†This whole Brexit thing is completely and utterly ridiculous!
pro	There is only one way to get the change we need - and that is to vote to go!
anti	There is simply no reason to assume the that final phase of Brexit preparation will be governed by reason, measured calculation and an outbreak of common sense - none at all. The Brexit debacle was based on lies, tory in-fighting and deluded beliefs about Britains position in the world. The only thing May seems capable of is incompetence not that this disturbs the political outlook of those who believe in unicorns or greater banana freedoms.
anti	There isn‚Äôt much that‚Äôs funny about Brexit. At least, not funny ha-ha.
anti	There isn‚Äôt one single tangible benefit to #Brexit, other than to tax avoiders.
anti	There may be some benefits, but personally and individually, we will be worse off
anti	There might be a few problems missing from the article but those listed should be enough to make any sensible person consider wanting to and how to put a stop to this nonsense before things get really messy.
pro	There needs no debate , we had a referendum , we voted out , we cant get a decent deal so we must leave on WTO rules . Nothing further needs to be debated . Any other outcome is not honoring the democratic vote .
anti	There never should have been a referendum (Cameron only called it to squeak back into power
pro	There never should have been an EU to begin with; it was all a banker's scam and a globalists wet dream.
pro	There never was supposed to be a deal we voted out that‚Äôs democracy
anti	There really is nothing to celebrate.
pro	There seems to be little doubt that the overall British economy will be stronger after BREXIT, although there will naturally be momentary disruption.
pro	There seems to be some part of 'Independent Sovereign Nation' that the EU doesn't understand. Until they stop trying to treat us as some kind of semi-detached member, this is going nowhere.
pro	There should be no remoaners in government, they all need to be removed from office!
pro	There shouldn't be foreign people in the UK
pro	There used to be a big benefit in agreeing on a telecoms or utility directive in the EU, but nowadays there is not much to be gained. So being in, doesn't have that big benefits.
pro	There was NEVER any intention by the EU dictatorship to give the UK a deal as they don't want other countries to leave when they see the whole of the UK prosper outside of the Failing corrupt,unelected EU
anti	There was a former great nation now sanctioning itself in favor of a set of illusions never woven before in history.
pro	There was a result. And the result should be accepted.
pro	There wasn't the option of voting for a deal, it was simply stay in or leave the EU, those were the only 2 choices we were given, it's not rocket science so why all the fuss about some deal ?, Let's just leave and wing it.
anti	There will also be a simultaneous economic fallout to cope with
anti	There will be NO JOBS coming to the UK. So be prepared to be eating out of bins
anti	There will be NO JOBS coming to the UK. So be prepared to be eating out of bins. Boris Johnson is a YANK.
anti	There will be a lot of very dissatisfied brexiteers within 5 years once the reality hits their miserable life's that nothing has improved and they are just poorer which is even admitted by their own governments assessments. Happy brexit suckers
anti	There will be a tremendous brain drain. The Brexiters will get the reversal of net migration they wish for.
pro	There will be far more problems if we DON'T leave the EU.
pro	There will be little left of the EU in 20 years time.
anti	"There will be many more reasons not to vote Tory if a ""no deal"" is allowed. Supermarkets, the nuclear industry, hospitals and Pharmaceuticals, the vehicle and manufacturing Industries and shipping are all in panic mode. Even Finance, arguably the one area modern Britain leads the world, is opening up scores of facilities in 3 European capitals and Frankfurt."
pro	There will be no EU Dictatorship in the future watch we are number 1 domino. Thank you to everyone who has put the Great back into Britain.
pro	There will be no benefits in the short term, but in the long term, the UK will come out smelling like a rose.
anti	There will be no economic success.
pro	There will be no endless delay of respecting people's will. They did not vote for a dealed Brexit, but simply to get of of the EU. The parliament has had two years for the procedure. Now it's enough!
pro	There will be no recession if we leave the EU. We will be in charge of our own economy.
pro	There will be other countries, like America,that will make good deals with Great Britain after Brexit.
pro	There will likely be some pain involved, but in the end the British people will now have a much bigger say in what happens in their own country.
anti	There will not be any going back in the foreseeable future. Britain will have to obey the same way as Norway and Switzerland to get access to the singel market. All other thoughts are just wishful thinking.
anti	There's a deep gulf between the right wing hard brexiters in the tory party and reality.
pro	There's a healthy spin on this one Vox. All of the negatives about leaving the EU but none of the positives besides less immigrants? A lot of media is only presenting one side of the story here.
anti	There's a word for THIS. And the word is DELUSION!
anti	There's millions of us. We're regrouping. We remain proEuropean. The country will not unite. All you had to do was keep the Brexiteers to their campaign promises and there would have been no argument. But you fucked up with WTO.
pro	There's no confusion we voted out and all these remainers come back with is project fear over and over again, lets leave on WTO rules and prove them wrong. WTO OVER AND OUT.
pro	There's nothing wrong or racist with wanting our British sovereignty. I'm half black and voted leave.
pro	There's nothing wrong with Brexit, it is great for the UK.
pro	There's only one kind of brexit, the one that won the referendum, so get it done.leave means leave.
pro	There, now stop scaremongering and raise a glass to Brexit!
anti	There. Is. No. #Brexit. Opportunity‚Ä¶it is a mythic and made up as unicorns, magic beans , Hogwarts, Middle Earth or Liam Fox‚Äôs trade deals. And saying it in a Spectator Leader doesn‚Äôt make it any less fantastical.
anti	There. Is. No. Brexit.
pro	Therefore, I support Brexit. Europe is becoming weaker and weaker every next day. Under german dictatorship, Europe will end up in bin
pro	Theresa May is actually damaging the country. Typical Remainer.
pro	Theresa May is arrogant. The people has spoken and they want Brexit and not a deal. She wants the deal because she still wants to be with the European Union
anti	Theresa May seems to be on a suicide mission & she‚Äôs taking us with her... ü§¶üèº
pro	Theresa may was a useless home secretary and it continues
anti	There‚Äôs a connection between the Trump treason and the Brexit - I‚Äôll call that treason too. It‚Äôs Wikileaks and Russia‚Äôs use of Wikileaks to warp public opinion. I‚Äôve seen photos of Nigel Farage at the front door of that same embassy.
anti	There‚Äôs several facts. Leave lied, consistently. Leave is trying to shift blame. Leave can‚Äôt take responsibility. The EU didn‚Äôt vote for brexit. And if you want to talk about communication, please refer to the Express and get back to me.
pro	These EU bullies just trying to make life hard for the British, when will we just tell them to do one, hang on a minute....
pro	These EU leaders are just a bunch of bullies . Scared that others will follow the UK example and leave. They may be saying non, non, non. but their tune may change if we withhold the billions they want? What can they do - take us to a court that we are saying will no longer have jurisdiction over us? Stick with it Mrs May. There will be something that they have forgotten about that they need which may break their stance.
anti	These Pro-Brexit people have empire on the brain. Those days are gone.
anti	These are the kind of people who voted for Brexit. They do not represent 'the will of the British people' they represent the will of fascism and racial hatred.
anti	These are the sunny uplands brexiteers dream of. Why not enjoy them as part of the EU?
pro	These hundreds of regulations are a huge burden on small businesses and each one comes with threats of punishment by way of fines of thousands of pound
anti	These idiots will be sorry when the food price will be increasing and they cannot longer travel freely. Remember the rich will never have the problems
pro	These interviews are clearly to mess up the Brexit! It‚Äôs all lies!!!
pro	These member countries lost sovereignty and to me that's never a good thing.
anti	These old Brexiters don't have an economic clue and not that bothered either as they're all on pension. To them it's all about migrants. Unfortunately on day 1 of Brexit our French chums boot our customs men out from Calais allowing all the Sangate flotsam to come across the channel. Being soft in the head, we'll allow them to stay while we 'process' them.That means they're here forever - Dover becomes the new Sangate, little England putters on and slips down the economic rankings until departing the Top 10 economies a decade later. Brexiters all dead by that stage so they don't give a damn about the mess they've made.
pro	These ridiculous indy polls are just lapped up here,but as a proud brexiter and trump supporter,Ive gloated on here forever it seems,it will be magnificent when he is a two term president.Donald will probably offer Tommy political asylum where he will be free of persecution.
pro	These self elected Rats in the EU Will not listen to anyone .Why should they ?They are the Dictators of EU .No one is allowed to tell the EU Rats in Parliament what to do .So dont pay a penny walk away now .No more idle chit chat
anti	They all acting like we was gonna float off into space!
pro	They are afraid that will will be much more competitive. Which we can be now we have left .
pro	They are better off if they exit
pro	They are finally independent
pro	They are going for a second referendum to keep us captured in the spider's web for good!
pro	They are insisting on the backstop to prevent us leaving.
pro	They are just holding us to ransom,...and we are giving in to them because there is no one with the guts of Nigel Farage to tell them to shove their deal up where the sun don't shine,.....just leave and save the 39 BILLION pounds that we will have to pay, if we stay,....they are broke, and in a bad way, they will really miss this payment.... plus...we buy much more from them than they do from us.....don't listen to the doom spreaders ....they have been wrong so far so just leave.
pro	They are not immigrants they are migrants. Immigrants leave a society and join a different one adopting the new society as their own and obey it's laws. Migrants invade and attempt to replace a society. If British people believe their identity is worth preserving they should want sovereignty and vote leave. If you're fine with converting to Islam then vote stay.
pro	They are only Interested in our money as we are the second highest payers into the EU.xx
pro	They are only upset coz they are not gonna get all the money the British government sends them I can see other European country's going next when they realise how much money their country's could save
pro	They are out to make an example of the UK as a warning to any other countries who may also harbour a desire to leave
pro	They are petrified that more countries will leave once they see the U.K. doing well.
anti	They are singing Land of Hope and Glory over the road. Says it all - a delusional sense of national importance predominantly among the older, tabloid reading populace, has enabled a grasping billionaire elite to manipulate swathes of the electorate to bring us to this pass. Singing songs from a previous century, as if to bring back Empire (as opposed to selling us all down the river).
anti	They are truly fucked. The break up of the union is on its way and all because of the English voters, hoping to return to the old empire.
anti	They aren't foreigners, they are fellow Europeans.
anti	They better worry about Ireland
pro	They big problem is that the EU expanded too far, too soon. This is where the problems with immigration come into play. When it was a smaller union, the MS had similar GDP's. Now that several, relatively poor, Eastern European states have joined, of course there has been mass immigration.
anti	They can't even agree to agree talks about coming to an agreeable compromise.
anti	"They couldn't get any support for BREXIT until they framed it as an immigration issue (sound familiar?) The Southern Strategy: ""Convince the majority that someone is getting something that they feel entitled to and you can pick their pockets. Convince the majority that the person receiving a benefit is a person of color and they will empty their pockets for you"".Russia has capitalized on the majority's fear and disdain of people of color all over the world."
anti	They deserve nothing more than what they voted for. They should all lose their jobs that were created only because of EU
pro	They did NOT vote for a DEAL, they voted to LEAVE.
pro	They did it. I am definitely skeptical of the European Union so I'm not shedding a tear. I don't agree with how they are doing it but that's their business. People who were opposed to Brexit have nobody to blame but the opposition. The complete inability of opposition parties to unify instead of political grandstanding was hilarious. This decision was made by Labour, the Lib-Dems, and SNP as much as it was made by the Tories.
pro	They did the right thing
pro	They didn't tell you Brexit would be dropped into hibernation for years did they? Been like trying to squeeze a Brexit peg into a Remainers square hole since.
anti	They don't have staff to fill the shelves in my local supermakets already. Whole sections are being left empty. Where are the British workers leave.eu promised?
pro	They don't have to pay outrageous taxes to EU anymore, and take in hostile migrants, who want to use their women as incubators and mooch
pro	They don't have to pay outrageous taxes to EU anymore, and take in hostile migrants, who want to use their women as incubators and mooch.
pro	They finally got the message. Happy brexit day
pro	They get to control their own destiny regarding foreign policy currency and immigration
pro	They have all been our historic enemies at some point in time, and it looks like most of them still are.
pro	They have been in positions of power where they could have stood up for the British, but like all the other pro-EU parties just carried on.
pro	They have had 3.5 years. Do you seriously think Europe wants to lose that massive car industry trade. Try to be serious for once MSM instead of whipping up hysteria.
anti	They have spent 40 years blaming the EU for everything from unaffordable housing (which is not a nationwide issue in any other EU country) to overcrowded roads (which is not a nationwide issue in any other EU country). That isn‚Äôt going to stop. In fact, if anything, TBF, it will be funny to hear them go on (and on, and on...) blaming the EU for their own mess as the country continues to go down the pan.
pro	They have taken a demand to give up our 10% say in the EU and retrieve our 100% sovereignty over the UK, and managed to turn it into a ‚Äòdeal‚Äô which gives up both.
anti	They have voted for people to be worse off, they have voted for people to lose their jobs, to lose their homes, to struggle to pay their bills, to make raising their children harder
pro	They keep telling us what we can't have because we won't be in the club, then they tell us we've got to follow their rules even when out of the club. They want it all, tell them where to go Boris
anti	They know #Brexit will be a huge failure, but if the EU collapses they can then say we were right to leave anyway. They want the UK and the EU to fail. It will please their paymasters - Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump.
anti	They lied to the people when they said Brexit is easy. Since the result was very close ‚Äì 51.9 vs. 48.1% - I‚Äôm almost certain that enough people would vote differently today to stop this madness, now knowing some of the negative consequences
pro	They must back down and they will. They always do. We should have played hardball from the start. Once they know Hard Brexit is on the table, they will dance to a different tune.
pro	They need us more than we need them, spineless negotiation, just walk away and watch Italy and Greece take back their sovereignty too...
anti	They only care about the leavers, why? Remainers should have a voice too.
anti	They seem to think of this as vindication of their position when in reality it is an irrelevant surrogate for the Brexit benefits that don‚Äôt exist. If I ever see a tangible positive for Brexit, I‚Äôll acknowledge it.
pro	They shall leave. They are too ‚Äúempiristic‚Äù. They think that they are alone. Keep them alone. This is, when one doesn‚Äôt fit into a group.
pro	They should have thought of all this before they joined the shitty Eu
anti	They sing for their deal, not real Brexit. They are stealing the money of British people.
pro	They took their country back from the EU and we're taking ours back from the socialists in November!
pro	They used Britain for tax reasons now these big companies want out before inland revenue start asking questions.
anti	They voted Leave so they must want economic destruction and poverty.
pro	They voted the right way. We do NOT want to be part of this totally corrupt, EU Nazi dictatorship. Only Big Business wants to make it easy on themselves, and they are willing to kill off British democracy to get their way. We must fight these Vile EU Nazi lovers in our country.
pro	They voted to LEAVE the EU, so LEAVE. Its that simple.
anti	They voted to leave! Lmfaoooo
pro	They voted to remain so they could keep their boyfriends here, that's all.
anti	They want the benefits from the European Union, but they don't want to invest in the European Union.
anti	They watched our country install Trump we get to watch them do this. Both huge stupid moves.
anti	They were too frightened to let us have a second referendum because they knew they would lose hands down. Why leave our European friends?
anti	They will be happy until they have no jobs and no income. If they are pensioners and when the banks relocate to Frankfurt and then close, they won't get their pensions.
anti	They will never, ever take responsilbity for brexit being a failure. It'll be remainer saboteurs who didn't get behind Britain, or drunken Junker and the EUSSR refusing us a deal, or any other scapegoat. They will never accept that they are wrong. It's always going to be someone else's fault.
anti	They will pay a heavy price for listening to the lies that brought them to this.
anti	They will still be miserable hedge, pothole, noise complainers in the morning. Soon the deep realisation will set in, it wasn't the EU making their lives miserable. EU was propping up a country living a lie.
pro	They will struggle in the beginning as they get their sea legs, but just like when US declared its independence from Britain, so to Britain will succeed in their national freedom.
pro	They won't have to take in so many migrants once they leave. This is good for them.
anti	They won't take responsibility. Guess who they will blame....... the B foreigners. It will NEVER BE their fault.
anti	They wont have a chance without the rest of Europe ....
pro	They'll be fine, Switzerland isn't in is in the EU. Go ahead look up how good Switzerland is doing.
anti	They'll get exactly what they voted for twice. Not what they wanted, but what they voted for.
pro	They'll have to start raiding their piggy banks when we leave and they can't use us as a cash cow any more!
anti	They'll sit back and just let the UK screw itself over and then cave. It's worked so for them so far. They've got everything they've wanted to date and they know Johnson says one thing, swears to do it then caves. They know we've followed the emptiest of people.
anti	They're going to regret it.
pro	They're still trying to dictate to us , even though we're now out.
pro	They're still trying to kill Brexit and gave the country to the EU in an even worse arrangement than the one we voted to leve. It's just disgraceful, actual treason right under our noses
anti	They've got a plan for the UK and it doesn't include Europe or democracy.
pro	They've got their confrontation and conflict.
pro	They've had two years to prepare for a no deal ffs and they haven't done nothing !!!! What is the matter are they unable to do it or is it because they have no intention in leaving the EU !!!!
anti	They‚Äôll need more than luck.
pro	They‚Äôre trying to hold our country hostage! I say we call their bluff! #NoDeal time to walk away and protect our sovereignty!
anti	Thick as shit. Sorry but it's quite obvious these morons have no idea what they voted for
anti	Thick. Shame on the English
pro	Think big and leave the EU
anti	Think the U.K. going break up shame took few bigots to ruin a nation shame but hey that‚Äôs what those Brexiters deserve if that happens.
anti	Think we should vote again on brexit most people did not know what thay was voting
anti	This ! EU just got massively cheaper cars. Post-Brexit our cars selling into EU will be tariff-laden while Japanese ones will not !
pro	This #referendum is the patriots of the working class v big businesses and treasonous unhinged traitors! Which one are you? #VoteLeave
anti	This BREXIT deal was brokered and approved by England's very own United King-Dumb Boris Johnson. Looking forward to seeing Scotland break away so they can broker their own deal with the EU. FREEDOM...from The King-DUMB!!!
anti	This Brexit WANT TRUMP and his crime FRIENDS
anti	This Brexit shitshow is going to cause so much pain.
anti	This Hard Right Tory government can‚Äôt wait to Strip us of the Human Rights Act.. they are falling over themselves over the point of being able to do it.. Then they can get away with Murder... over 130‚Äô000 Sick and Disabled dead in the last 10 years, think of the number of us Disabled who will be a Target for them if they get rid of the human rights act....
pro	This Is England, Returned to a Sovereign Nation.
pro	This Is England, Returned to a Sovereign Nation. Maybe one day, Europe will change its behavior. TRUMP for British Prime Minister!!!
pro	This all boils down to the fact that the EU does not favour competition. It wants to ensure that there is none. This is proved by the fact that it wants to prevent its biggest export market having a successful economy by refusing a reasonable trade deal because that market might become too competitive. No country would ever demonstrate such stupidly, only an undemocratic bureaucracy unanswerable to its own people.
anti	"This all reminds me of that last scene in Finding Nemo, where the fish in plastic bags finally managed to get in the sea, but still trapped in their plastic bags. ""Now what?"""
pro	This and Trump in the same year. 2016 was a truly awesome year!
anti	This angers me because they didn't think about Ireland and the fact that a huge European border is in the middle of Ireland and this will probably cause conflict but they aren't even mentioning it
pro	This article sums up exactly how I feel. WE HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR MINDS! Stand firm and let's just get out if they wont give us a fair deal. Have courage and be brave. Believe in this great country.
pro	This brought a Prideful tear to my eyes. FREEDOM is ALL.
pro	This can go on forever. The eu bullies will not change their minds, they desperately don‚Äôt want us to leave and are doing all they can to prevent it. Just let us get out of this failing corrupt eu
anti	This circus reminds me the last scene of ‚ÄòFinding Nemo‚Äô, when all the fish were happily free from Darla (EU) but trapped in the plastic bags with NO DAMN CLUE of what to do next
anti	This comment is the text version of a small child holding a boot against their own head. You're going to be affected by the EU, but now you won't have any say in it. So push that boot harder, I guess.
pro	This confirms that the EU has a death wish. Let's hope the end comes soon.
pro	This country belongs to the crown,
anti	This country has improved out of all recognition since joining. It's laughable to say you can't see any advantage.
anti	This country is finished. Over.
anti	This country is going down the drain while the tories squabble like a bunch of school kids.
pro	This country is heading for great times, as soon as we cut off the leaches of Europe. Stop fearing my friend, look deeper about the EU, check out the killing rules of the Lisbon Treaty, we can‚Äôt even call ourselves a nation in 2020, that‚Äôs just the tip, it‚Äôs real - it‚Äôs true!
anti	This decision is a death blow to the poorest in the UK, unemployment will skyrocket now.
anti	This goof will only divide Britain more.
anti	This government is about to do what no British government has ever done in history, to destroy Britain! Demand Ref2. Stop Brexit!
pro	This guy who is out each day protesting for another vote to remain is renting a house a opposite Mogg at ¬£6,000 a month...who is paying the rent.????
anti	This has angered me. Why have they been so probrexit for the last 4 years and now they are pointing out what a load of bollocks it is? If they'd have joined us in criticism and fact checks prior, then we'd still be a significant country.
anti	This has been the biggest waste of time and money ever, the vote should never have taken place in the first place because it was based on a damaging lack of all the facts, we were all lied to.....everyone knows that a lot of leave voters are racist bigots who don't like johnnny foreigner coming over here and thats what we fought two world wars for blah blah blah, utter bullshit....then we have the argument that we don't want to get ruled by unelected people....so just like we get ruled by the banks and directors in charge who were not elected by the public, like your boss at work who was not elected by the public, like all of the police who were not elected by the people blah blah blah......we have an over inflated opinion of the UK and think we are so much better and powerful than we actually are and can easily stand on our own feet, really?? So where do we get most of our gas and electricity from?? where does over 80% of our supermarket food come from?? we produce hardly anything anymore except thousands of call centres and coffee shops.........
anti	This has got to stop. #Stopbrexit. #PeoplesVote #OptionToRemain. I have never felt more ashamed of being British.
anti	This has to STOP! In the event of #NoDeal, the surest thing to do is to withdraw #Article50. This must be a priority consideration for UK Parliament, who are bound to place our national security above all else.
anti	This has to be one of the dumbest decisions ever made.. How will the UK economy ever work without eu?
anti	This honestly makes me embarrassed to be British.
anti	"This i feel is going to bite them in the butt. No one in the Union is going to give them a helping hand i hope not. You need friendly helping neigbours. I now diffently Harry made the right move ""get the hell out"" $ of goods are going to sky rocket for bussiness owners. Alberta üá®üá¶ watch and learn!"
anti	This is Gibraltar who's people voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and are now forced to live under the yoke of the xenophobic little englander mobs rule.
anti	This is The Telegraph making stuff up. It's terrified it's readers are waking up to the fact that Brexit isn't working. It can't work !
pro	This is YOUR victory. For once, the little guy won.
pro	This is a biased and narrow view of us leaving the EU, why not report on the great foundation that us leaving will produce. I think you have got an incorrect name for your Channel, no way should you be reporting on 'Global' News!
pro	This is a big day for people who feel like they personally fought in WW2 despite being born in 1958.
pro	This is a choice of common sense, that it is not the intentions of Britain to be apart of an undemocratic Union.
pro	This is a club that we are told it is wonderful to belong too. I don't think so.
anti	This is a crazy joke! Fed up of Brexit what a mess!!! UK is a worldwide laughing emoji
pro	This is a glorious speech! I am so happy for the people of the United Kingdom! You're free again!
anti	This is a good man, he knows what he's talking about. Take his advise, vote IN!
pro	This is a good piece. I would go so far as to say that had the EU fanatics foiled brexit I would have supported an armed uprising and I am a Mr goody two shoes. Thankfully we have avoided that and the destruction of our democracy. God bless the UK the British people and dear old Nigel farage who's family were put through hell by the crazy remainders.
pro	This is a great day, Britain is an independent sovereign state once again, come what may and it might get a little rough we are free from the shackles of the EU. Free to run our own country.
pro	This is a great day. Hopefully Boris can do what Trump has done. No more pandering to these elite left traitors.
anti	This is a messy divorce!
pro	This is a moment to be brave, to reach out - not to hug the skirts of Nurse in Brussels, and refer all decisions to someone else.
pro	This is a momentus day. I have longed for this day for decades. I have been considered extreme or na√Øve or culpable of wishful thinking over the years as I foretold the UK exit from the EEC / EU one day and our rejection of the Euro. I am still considered all those things by some for anticipating the final collapse of the EU / USE one day. Mark my words, this is a great day for the Western world and the 21st century. This is the day when the 20th century is finally buried. The old certainties of European dominance, of bigger is better, of regulation over flexibility are gone. In the future nations will have to be fleeter of foot, educate their populations to adapt not adopt, be ready for the technology and natural changes that will shape our environment (both physically and culturally). The UK is back in business. The world is our oyster and the world is welcome to trade with us, engage with us, live with us and be our partners and friends. We welcome those who wish to have sanctuary here and who are willing to abide by our laws (and not import their own). We welcome those who wish to trade with us. We welcome those who wish to seek friendship and mutual assurance against those that would wish us ill. We will stand by our friends and guard against our enemies. We will help and assist those who find themselves in trouble, particularly those in the EU in the years to come as that crumbling edifice finally gives way. We will help as we did in the centuries gone by and we will gladly do so, for we know that to have a strong Europe is to have security for our islands. We do not wish to see an undemocratic, fractious and politically extreme Europe. God Save the Queen and long live the UK
pro	This is a perfect illustration of why BREXIT is so correct and necessary to begin with. Centralized, dictatorial, authoritarian, unaccountable, un-elected government from the outside.
pro	This is a sad day for remainers but a good day for democracy
anti	This is a sad day. It won‚Äôt look different tomorrow. It won‚Äôt even feel different. But like any death, GriefnLoss will cloud the eye and simultaneously harden and tear our hearts. Never forget this was put into place by nefarious immoral n self interested politicians
anti	This is a terrible day.
anti	This is a travesty for the average Brit. Watch what will happen. Prices will rise...jobs will get scarcer... it will be a disaster !
anti	This is a very very bad not good day for Britain
pro	This is a video made as part of the remain campaign..
anti	This is about immediacy, isn't it. People see immigrants in their town, but they only indirectly see the benefits. And the politicians and newspapers attribute blame - or credit - for their contribution.
pro	This is about loving being a part of Europe but hating being a part of the European Union.
anti	This is absolutely true, but after Brexit, anti-Corbynism and utter right wing bias on Question Time and the Today programmes it will be an uneasy alliance
anti	This is actually sad
pro	This is all done to force a second referendum.It's a massive deception. This is nothing new all political parties lie and cheat. No way will I be changing my OUT vote.
anti	This is almost criminal levels of incompetence. There is no mandate for this. What the fuck are we doing to ourselves?
pro	This is an absolute failure of democracy for the government failing to enforce the will of the people.
anti	"This is an example of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fix something that isn‚Äôt broken"""
anti	This is an example of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fix something that isn‚Äôt broken‚Äù
pro	This is an excellent summary and proves the Brexiteers correct. The EU are being unreasonable and arrogant. They are being stubborn and putting their politics ahead of reason and the nation's they purport to serve. If they want to play chicken then they will lose. We will drift towards no deal and they will be to blame.
anti	This is awful! Why do they do this?
anti	This is becoming more amusing by the day. I can't believe an entire country fell for this nonsense.
anti	This is disastrous!
anti	This is embarrassingly crap! This will be shown all over the world as us leaving Europe, OMG
pro	This is exactly what the EU dictators were afraid of. If England is successful with its Brexit, that could open the floodgates for others to follow. The EU is becoming an unwanted organization, that will soon dissolve in the dust bins of history...good riddance.
pro	This is first piece on video that has tapped into the real anger about British membership of the EU . People feel they are second class citizens in their own land and they do not like being ignored whilst mass migration is imposed upon them. They voted leave because they want at least the semblance of democracy back. Under the EU there is no democracy. If Brexit is sabotaged as seems likely by Theresa May that anger will transfer to social unrest or worse. Leave means leave that it.
anti	This is going to cost Britain SO many billions.
pro	This is going to save the UK. Congratulations.
pro	This is hilarious were leaving...accept it. Psychologically filling the gaps with negative connotation will not stop this great nation leaving the dictatorship.
anti	This is home, our home and Earth. We will stay!
pro	This is how democracy dies... with EU funded nobles overruling the people
anti	This is just a horrible decision. Scotland didn‚Äôt even vote for this and I won‚Äôt be surprised if they voted to be free from the UK and join as a member of the EU.
pro	This is just garbage, nothing in here makes me change my mind. The cold hard facts on the EUnion are there in black and white in the Constitution. Its antithetical to democratic principles. I still want nothing to do with them.
anti	This is just like when GERI HALLIWELL overestimated her valiability as a soloartist and left the Spice Girls
pro	This is just the start of the end of the EU. When other nations find out how well we have done in the future without the EU, they will leave too.
anti	This is like when Geri Halliwell overestimated her viability as a solo artist and left the spice girls.
anti	This is not just about politics. This will affect the lives of many people. Brits that have worked in the European Union will now be considered a foreigner. No more traveling across the borders and much more. Trade. Companies that have built a business somewhere in Europe. So much that will need to be changed. I do not think when the people voted they were fully informed of the complexity!!
anti	This is not the end. it is the beginning of the end.
anti	This is one of the things I find frustrating about the arguments for #Brexit. The #EU is so much more than just trade. It's social & cultural cooperation for peace & prosperity. I used to work on EU funded research. We're throwing it all away for no benefit. Brexit is pointless.
pro	This is our country, this is our people. We aren't gonna fall because we've got eachother. Be proud of our flag be proud of our name, we are the UK and we're going to shine once again
anti	"This is probably an insensitive thing to say but sadly its true ... most of the ppl that voted ""Leave"" were older ppl who probably won't be around in 20 years when we realize the full extent of the damage Brexit has caused the Britain ... the younger generation will have to pay the price of this stupid decision...instead of caring for their young older Brits chose to hate immigrants so much they screwed their younger generation out of mobility and jobs and and an open market .... Bravo!"
anti	This is ridiculous everything that happens in this bloody country country they blame the emigrants lol wtf the main problem is the Eastern European‚Äôs is sad really the black girl she said we take their job well they lazy to work lol
anti	This is ridiculous. Everyone know that Putin is behind this and probably Princess Meghan as well. They've got a plan for the UK and it doesn't include Europe or democracy.
pro	This is so exciting! YAY, and congratulation Brits!
anti	This is so funny worldwide everyone is laughing at England about this
anti	This is such a joke, Brexiteers scream about sovereignty and being ruled from Brussels. Yet they are quite willing to take us out of a Brussels based supranational organisation where we are one of the most powerful voices and benefit enormously, only to immediately subjugate us to the power & control of a Geneva based supranational organisation where we barely have a voice at all and will be forced to obey rules, regulations & conditions that make it much harder for our companies who will also face new tariffs & trade barriers.
pro	This is the Best thing that they ever did.. Britain has been dragged through the mud with all the integration of uneducated migrants and the Muslim invasion.
pro	This is the EU begging for a NO DEAL.
anti	This is the UK decay
anti	This is the beginning of the end. Feels so sad.
pro	"This is the effect of "" * illegal Muslim immigration * "" in the region without thinking on order of brainlessAngela Merkel . Believe or not BRITAIN done its job..And I must appreciate decision of people of Britain."
pro	This is the end of Political Correctness in the UK. We want a second referendum to really shove it the face of Remoaners!
anti	This is the end of the United Kingdom.
anti	This is the end. I'm moving.
pro	This is the greatest moment in modern British history.
pro	This is the greatest moment in the history of our great nation
pro	This is the greatest moment in the modern history of our great nation.
anti	This is the level of how smart some of the leave voters are.
anti	This is the moment for us to change - to fight for continued membership and then playing a more ACTIVE ROLE in shaping the future of the EU.
pro	This is the moment when we really begin to unite and level up.
pro	This is the only opportunity we will ever have to show that we care about self-rule.
anti	This is the perfect example of the tyranny of the (small) majority
anti	This is the perfect example of the tyranny of the (small) majority. You cannot drag 48% of a nation out of a union they wish to be a part of whilst at the same time promising to heal division. A dark day indeed.
anti	This is the problem of swinging the pendulum to the other extreme as a knee jerk reaction. Yes, Britain and Europe in general faced a huge immigration crisis in 2014-15. However the answer is not the other extreme where you take in 0 immigrants. Like anything else in real life, you need to find the right balance and moderate.
pro	This is the whole point of ‚Äúfunding‚Äù from the EU! Where did they get the money from in the first place? Would you deposit ¬£1000 in your bank to receive back ¬£800 and then say ‚Äú Oh thank you how wonderful you are‚Äù ? Not bloody likely is the answer, but this is exactly what we have done for 47 years! Incredible isn‚Äôt it?
pro	This is the will of the people, a great victory for direct democracy!
pro	This is the work of globalists. We must name them so that we can fight them.
anti	This is the worst trade negotiation since Star Wars: the phantom menace
anti	This is total lunacy. They just shot themselves on the foot. They will regret it.
pro	This is unbelievable. Controlling shareholders in public companies? What ARE they on? Suppose we then said that we want all our leccy companies to be owned by Britaish shareholders? And forced them to be so acquired? At rock bottom cost? This is so silly it must mark the end of the EU as a serious organisation
anti	This is utter madness! Why don't they stop it? Not ONE good thing is going to come out of Brexit! And please don't .mention 'sovereignty', we always had it!
pro	This is vitally important, knowing first hand the importance free movement had on my professional music career.
anti	This is what Brexit has done. It‚Äôs brought the racist twats out into the open. This poster was put up in a block of flats in Norwich. The dregs of society are emboldened by what was always a project by the right made popular by anti immigrant lies & propaganda from Blojo‚Äôs pals!
anti	This is what I don‚Äôt get about leavers... they make out that we give the EU money but don‚Äôt get the same amount back... have they never heard of a membership before? You don‚Äôt walk into the gym and pay for your membership and then expect them to pay you back do you? No. You pay for use of the services they provide and that‚Äôs how a membership works...
pro	This is what I said to my friend just after the vote. UK voted to exit the EU but we'll soon see that this vote does not count and UK will stay in EU anyway. It is the end of democracy so the beginning dictatorship.
pro	This is what I've been saying for weeks that the eu are taking the piss out of United Kingdom so why doesn't the queen get involved
anti	This is what full employment looks like???, minimum wage jobs and zero hour contracts!!!...Yet these people blame the EU???, this is squarely down to the intransigent tory government...
anti	This is what happens when you act without planning You will regret and back-paddle
anti	This is what nationalist populism does to a country.
pro	This is what people need to know. Out means out 221747 it‚Äôs a Petition for out!
pro	"This is what the EU were afraid of, can you imagine what the produces of 27 countries are going to say to those unelected beaurocrats in Brussels, yep, just as we thought,"" we still need to trade with the UK our livelihoods depend on it "" when will they ever learn ?"
pro	This is what the eu does... f... all...
anti	This is what they do in banana republics. It seems we are heading in that direction!
anti	This is where the delusions of Brexiters meets reality. The EU should just call Johnson's bluff.
pro	This is why I hated the remain campaign. They made liberal idiots hijack the idea EU and Europe are the same thing. The EU is a toxic cloud, every major European country has movements to leave. It is zero to do with being anti European.
anti	This is why I say exit brexit, get a real plan and I truly believe that the swing vote will go your way!
anti	This is why we shouldn't let old people vote
anti	"This isn't a fight. It's just self-harm. What do we get if we ""win""? I just don't see the benefit to all this."
anti	This isn't even close to a revolution! A revolution isn't lead by right wing elitists such as farage and boris
pro	This isn't what I voted for. Revolution please.
anti	This isn‚Äôt a celebration about leaving it‚Äôs a celebration of it finally being over.... now we can get screwed over
pro	This just means the stage is being set for the fulfilment of prophecy. Britain a protestant nation had to remove itself from the EU pack of catholic nations. The nations which will help usher in the Anti-christ are all catholic.... part of the original 10 nations which is a part of the Roman empire.
pro	This just shows how useless and pointless the parliament actually is, if as you say it is a forgone conclusion done deal by behind the scenes commities. The EU is a total sham of a democracy. It cheapens the idea of democracy. Its why we are leaving.
pro	This kind of reporting instigates trouble no matter what camp you are in.If remain had won we wouldn‚Äôt be having this conversation because the result would have been accepted.Why on earth remainers cannot accept a democratic vote doesn‚Äôt say much for our democracy
pro	This makes a no-deal/WTO Brexit even more likely. Bye bye EU üëãüëã
anti	This makes me feel so bad for my kids. In a few years they‚Äôll be in the job market, so many opportunities have been take away from them - they only have British passports. We‚Äôve become 2nd class citizens in Europe
pro	This man is right. we voted OUT, if they don't want a Deal, they do not get the money!
anti	This may come as a complete surprise to many #Brexit supporters, but the EU trade negotiator Michel Barnier will be looking after the interests of the 27 countries that are members of the EU. Strangely, there is no requirement for him to look after the interests of a non-member!
anti	This may come as a surprise to many Brexiteers but you were always going to have a worse off deal than the one you have with the EU now.
anti	This morning as I reached for my inhaler I'm very thankful I don't live in the UK. I'd be worried sick I'd not be able to get the right medication. Not being able to breathe can really affect your overall quality of life* #Brexit #RevokeA50
anti	This not going to end well...
pro	This open border does not allow us to check and control people
pro	This place we call home was not, and never will be a REGION OF EUROPE--it is a place called THE BRITISH ISLE
anti	This reflects the total failure of the UK to correctly prioritize education and training.
anti	This reminds me of a caged animal, afraid to come out when the door is opened
pro	This remoaner bilge is tiresome. It is a lie that there is a silent majority for remain, it is simply not true that those who didn't vote want to stay in the EU. We had a national vote, the turnout was excellent and the result conclusive. Non voters chose not to take part, we know nothing about their views. If remoaners insist on counting them it simply shrinks their share from 48% to 34%.
anti	This result doesn't change any of the facts: ‚Ä¢ Brexit is still a terrible idea ‚Ä¢ Johnson is still a liar ‚Ä¢ The EU still won't let us have our cake and eat it ‚Ä¢ The US will still drink our milkshake ‚Ä¢ Vote Leave still cheated and the Tories used similar tactics this time ‚Ä¢ The Tories will still primarily serve their rich donors
pro	This should have been done three years ago ,now we would be well down road an away from the EU dictatorship by now
anti	This so called UK Government should be dismissed for gross incompetence and misconduct...what an unbelievable State we have become!
anti	This sort of unreasonable thinking and angry behaviour makes me worried about the future. Trying to blame all problems on migrants when they have contributed so much to the U.K makes me feel sick.
pro	This time tomorrow our Great country will be on a new future that we control, govern and direct. There's been generations of people whilst under EU rule, who have not known or experienced how great the United Kingdom was and what we have to offer the World and what a fantastic position we are viewed from by other countries around the World, countries that are lining up to be part of our future. Yes we will have re-moaners saying next week why hasn't the Government changed anything and lets go back, but that's just part of this instant change culture that expect everything to be done at a click of a button. Things take time, great changes takes time. Happy Brexit Day :-)
pro	This video does not tell the full story. Immigration is a secondary factor to leave the EU. The primary one is making sure Britain remains a fee and independent country and does not become a province of a United Sates of Europe. This is the main reason we will be going and not return.
anti	This video is completely ridiculous. The Eu has more benefits and we should definitely stay
pro	This video proves how moronic remainers are. We need to leave the evil EU!!
anti	This vote FOR Brexit was TrumpTarded. Idiots for rialed up by stupid false racist propaganda and voted for a terrible decision w clear thinking people staying at home & not voting. They should have the core again. If Brexit wins carry on. If it gets overturned then drop it.
anti	This was a sad day
anti	This was a terrible decision and I think it would never pass if voted on again.
anti	This was always going to happen and was seen by all remainders. Only the blue passport gang would deny this was always on the cards.
anti	This was never going to work out. The people promoting Brexit all left after they won and left the pro EU people deal with the outcome. This referendum was dumb to start with. The EU has its issues, but breaking it up won‚Äôt fix it.
anti	This was not a political revolution. the leavers got absolutely nothing. they've admitted that this will not stop immigration, they've admitted that this will not save the NHS, they've given Boris Johnson the Prime Minister title - he's more right wing than Camron and will cut a lot more then him, they've divided divided the UK more then ever, Scotland is sure to leave. Oh and obviously the housing market will crash again.
anti	This was not democracy. The Brexit leaders are admitting they misled ppl Many ppl used vote as protest against Gvmt
pro	This was one of the proudest moments of my life. Britain woke up in time.
pro	This was the best birthday ever. for 9 years i had been shouting at the tv asking where was my referendum whenever the was governent on tv.
pro	This what we been saying all the time. We will be better of outside the EU. A lot of the other big Countries will not be.
pro	This whole Brexit charade tells us a couple of things... The EU is worse than we thought and wants to punish us for voting leave.
anti	This whole Brexit shambles has brought embarrassment and humiliation upon us Brits. I am deeply ashamed of my country, but immensely proud of being a Citizen of Europe (at least for the remaining 6 hours). But I'm sure we WILL be back!
anti	This whole Brexit was a conservative policy, so lets get another party in office who doesn't believe in it and save our economy. We can fix most Brexitiers problems. Enforce the WTD which will lead to lower cost homes, less Europeans coming as they won't be able to work anymore hours than other EU countries. Zero hour contracts will end as employers tie staff in, people will have social time so pubs and other social activities will grow including family time and so on. Yes, we will still pay ¬£8b a year, but if the Banks and the car industry take ¬£1 Trillion over to Berlin/EU as planned, it will take 125 years offset just that and not 50 years like Mogg says, just consider the tax and reinvestment of our money being moved across will stay in the EU.
anti	This whole brexit fiasco is already in chaos
anti	This whole brexit thing is like watching someone who decided to shoot themselves in the foot for no good reason endlessly debate whether they should seek medical attention or just keep on shooting and see if things get better.
anti	This whole referendum is a smoke screen. People should unite and live in peace. Nationalism through history caused only destruction. Vote stay and lets make the EU strong and prosperous!
pro	This will be SKI News with more Scaremongering or reporting on something that could go wrong if we leave this Corrupt EU..Don't listen to the scaremongering it's been happening for many years. Brexit will make the UK stronger..
anti	This will be a mess.
anti	This will be a significant road-marker on the historical decline of GB
pro	This will be the perfect year if Donald Trump gets elected, Hillary Clinton gets arrested, the European Union dissolves, and Scotland gets independence.
anti	This will be viewed as a huge victory. That each household has saved ‚Ç¨7 to travel, when brexit is still going to cost each household thousands each year! ü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏è
anti	This will cause instability in the UK and EU
anti	This will slowly lead to the collapse of the uk
pro	This year we had net immigration which equated to a city the size of Newcastle, next year it could be a city the size of Manchester and there is not a thing we can do about it so long as we are in the EU. No wonder the people using A&E increased by 14% in just one year and next year immigration will be even greater following the increase in the living wage which is a massive draw for those in Eastern and Southern Europe. Our hospitals cannot cope, our schools cannot cope, we do not have enough houses and eventually there will be not enough jobs. We must stop this madness and get out now and at least we can then decide who comes into our country and the numbers. At the moment we can do precisely nothing, whatever Cameron and Corbyn tell us.
anti	This. There are towns in the UK that are so poor they have had millions poured into them by EU development grants and Farmers who depend on EU subsidy to survive. Still they lobbied and voted BREXIT. Fucking idiots.
anti	Those that voted for it deserve to suffer for their ignorance and posturing.
pro	Those unelected overlords in Brussels are not happy you fine Brits took your country back and will try to punish you as a example. Stay strong my cousins across the pond, we back you all the way !
anti	Those who argue for Brexit are wrong, and that is because they have not been properly informed about the costs.
pro	Those who chose not to vote, have no right to complain about the consequences of their inaction
pro	Those who don't want us to leave are the immigrants who have not taken out British Citizenship such as, Romanians, Bulgarians, Polish & Muslims because they don't want to lay the costs of becoming a British Citizen!
anti	Those who look forward to Trump's second term, are the same type of individual excited about Brexit. I believe Putin destroyed two once great and respected nations weaponizing social media propaganda. It was highly effective.
anti	Those who saw the vote as a protest against poverty are now experiencing the thin end of the wedge of inflation from a falling pound
pro	Those who say No Deal is bad say it because they want the UK to give away it's best negotiation tool. Why? - because they want to reverse the democratic vote and to remain in the EU
anti	Those who voted for leave will cry the most in the future.
pro	Threaten the EU to make UK a tax Haven, you would soon get Company's moving over to the UK. Not my idea of business but to hell with the EU.
anti	Through commonly agreed EU standards, national Governments have achieved improvements to the quality of air, rivers and beaches. Good for Britain and good for Britons holidaying or living abroad!
pro	Throughout all Europe, we are more than proud of the Brits for having escaped the European tyranny.¬†Let's hope numerous nations will follow you up!
anti	"Tiddy ""...the UK will be the only country in the World to have voluntarily regressed and made itself poorer..."" Well, there is Venezuela..."
pro	Time for Britain to both Roar and for Britain to Bite Back There is a global stage and we can rule our waves again. Happy Independence
pro	Time for May to resign leading to a new election. Hopefully BREXIT supporters will win a majority in the new Parliament. BREXIT!
pro	Time for Remoaners to finally admit they never really liked the EU either, in fact they barely know a thing about it, they just hate Britain (taking their lead from the BBC).
anti	Time for some democracy. Let the people vote on the deal or to remain. Why are the Brexiters so afraid of another vote? Because they know that, having seen the facts, the people will not vote to be poorer. They will vote to remain. We are staying in the EU.
pro	Time for the European union to be history! once and for all! Europeans! Take your country's back NOW!!
anti	"Time to act to ""Take back control, Time to Vote Remain""!!!"
pro	Time to bring back the Empire.
pro	Time to front the bullies, take charge, and walk away
anti	Time to get the Irish passport then
pro	Time to learn to stand on your own two legs again, to relearn what it is to be an independent, sovereign nation, that gets to decide your own direction and future.
pro	Time to leave
pro	Time to leave people.
pro	Time to leave!
pro	Time to make Britain Great Again!!
pro	Time to regain our courage to make Great Britain great again
anti	Time to respect the will of the people......and stay in the EU.
anti	Time to save remain. We must not allow remain to be thwarted. Brexit is a lunatic idea with catastrophic consequences and must be prevented.
pro	Time to start stamping passports and reducing immigration, not to invoke article 50 to negotiate with people who have already said they will not negotiate. Better to negotiate from inside than outside. With regards to the forthcoming down votes, perhaps they should leave and go and live in the EU if they love it so much.
pro	Time to take our country back Let's go Red card to the eu Let's take our country back! auf veedetsen Angela Bye yo Borat We want our country back
pro	Time to tell the EU 'no decent Brexit deal, no ¬£39 billion'. We need to say it and mean it and show them the UK can make threats too.
pro	Time to walk away and give the EU the 'finger' they deserve.
pro	Time to walk away and start trading with the rest of the World ! WTO !!!!
pro	Time to walk away.... no deal is perfect
anti	Time will show us the truth of brexit. And it will not be pretty.
anti	Time will tell what the advantages of Brexit (if any) are.¬†All of the rhetoric by Farage and his Brexit Party misfits, will soon be shown to be a pack of lies.¬†Never mind, the English proletariat don't care, now they have their freedumb.
pro	"Time will tell, but if you do the research, you'll see that leaving was the best for Britain! Good job! Glad to see you regain your Independence and democracy - ""we the people"" have spoken!!"
anti	Tinged with regret, wishing that Brussles had only listened? Fabrication is your way isn't it? Brussels was never the problem. You were.
anti	To achieve very dodgy deals with the likes of the U.S. which will massively benefit the small section of the country as represented by ERG to the detriment of the majority of the population.
pro	To all fellow Brits, this is a day to celebrate. With special thanks to 17.4m and the ‚Å¶ @Telegraph ‚Å© who kept the battle alive for #BrexitDay. ‚Å¶
pro	To all the Project Fear scaremongers running around spreading fear of Britain starving the morning after Brexit.¬†India's got Britain's back. Punjab - the world's most fertile land of the five rivers, granary of the world, breadbasket of a billion people.¬†Bring on Brexit!
anti	To all the Remainers, I‚Äôm sorry too loose you from our big family, You are always welcome. To all the Brexiters. You are resented and pretty much hated by everyone in the 27 member states. You talk about Independence Day, and Freedom like you have fought off a occupying force. You have insulted every single country inside the EU, I own a Business that have suppliers and Customers all over the EU. If any of my suppliers or customers have acted like most Brexiters. I will cancel everything with that customer or Supplier. And Yes if you are wondering it is remarkable easy to tracking people‚Äôs online activity! Brexiters, Stay on your Island! You are seriously not welcome!
anti	To all the leavers, did you honestly think you could trust the brexiteers? Just look at them, most of them are abject cunts who think the poor should be killed off. IDS, Rees-Mogg, Farage. When was the last time you heard a leading brexiteer talk about poor people in anything other than disparaging language?
pro	To all the uniformed people making accusations that Britain cannot make up its mind what it wants, they did decide something clearly. It was the EU who roundly rejected it cos they are playing hardball. They voted with a majority for the Brady amendment which means the withdrawal agreement but with a unilateral exit mechanism four the backstop. A reasonable caveat in a post colonial world. EU said no as they have done for two years. What you are seeing now is not the UK being unable to make up it's mind what it wants. It is the UK being unable to accept the vassalage from the EU. History will judge this moment very differently to how most of you nitwits are reading it.
anti	"To all those Brexiters telling people to ""get over it"" and ""you lost"" when commenting on any post that refers negatively on Brexit... do you not see how these comments reflect so badly on yourself and see why the Remainers have such a problem with those that voted to leave the EU? The only logical reason I can see for you posting the way you are, is that you don't give two flying f**ks about the country you live in anyway, because in case you didn't notice, a struggling economy benefits very few and the poorest are always hit the hardest... so I have to conclude that your patriotic views can only be posturing, as flushing the country down the toilet is obviously anything but patriotic."
anti	To any friends from the EU reading this - I can assure you that a huge percentage of the UK population are sorry to leave the EU and don‚Äôt believe it is the best move for us. We are also embarrassed about those MEP muppets waving flags and behaving like children. Some of us hope to leave this God forsaken country as soon as possible and are working on that too¬†‚ù§Ô∏è
pro	To be a free nation, we have to leave the UN, it is corrupt and destructive to the west
anti	To be brutal, I'm 65 and I have fewer years left than those young people who should have the right to the kind of travel freedoms and opportunities as I had when I was younger. No way I'd deprive them of that.
pro	To be clear, you can't be #probrexit and not #ProBreakUp, the arguments are almost identical. It's time for Wangland to get a new flag.
anti	To be fair, the problems with Brexit do not really stem from the decision itself. It's the fact that it was so unexpected, so when you add incompetency and conflicting interests all of a sudden, it ends up like this. If it was a decision supported by an actual majority of population and politicians and was planned ahead, it would look different.
anti	To be honest I am looking forward to the bumbling #JohnsonTheLiar to have his interview with the attack dog #AndrewNeil. He shouldn't be on the @bbc he is very #rightwing very #probrexit not even slightly balanced Barclay Brother poodle #warmonger #climatechangedenier
anti	To be honest, I believe Charles de Gaulle was right, UK doesn‚Äôt belong to the continent! But now it would be disastrous to leave EU. For both sides. And let‚Äôs not forget, that if UK leaves EU, that would give to Scotland the chance to split out and abandon England and UK would be dismantled.
anti	To be honest, as much as I hate Brexit, it‚Äôs some pretty serious QC issues with the bikes and financial mismanagement (to put it generously) that have seen #Norton go under.
pro	To be honest... EU is worst that can happen to the world... massive left totalitarism. Yes to Brexit!
anti	To believe that Brexit will help solve some 'old' problems sounds incredibly naive. Brexit won't bring back industry, it won't lead to high pay, it won't solve the housing issues, it won't lead to investment in infrastructure or the NHS. If these things don't happen when you have a stable economy they are highly unlikely to happen with an unstable one.
anti	To call the EU a communist state proves you don't know what communism is. It's closer to an USA then it is to the USSR
pro	"To claim that Brexit is the fault of ""misinformed right wing"" politicians is twoddle. Plenty of the left in Britain wanted out and not because they were misinformed but because they were fed up of the twisted democracy in which the EU operates. It was the right decision and this video truly comes across as propaganda for the centrists and the left making the right out to be manipulative villains of the people."
anti	To hell with brexit.
pro	To hell with the EU and those who run it.
anti	To leave is a leap in the dark, all the Outers have is some vague promises that somehow it will be alright and everything will be hunky dory. The truth is that they haven't got a clue and their vanity is putting my, my family's and my country's financial and real security at risk.
anti	To leave the EU at this time in history would be a pathetic paranoid whimpering protest at thin air causing irreparable damage #voteremain
anti	To leave the EU would be the worst thing that could happen right now
anti	To leave would be ludicrous
anti	To leave would be the worst thing right now
pro	To me I am happy the UK are out and then everyone can get on with life and business.
pro	To me I am happy they are out and then everyone can get on with life and business.
pro	To remain in the dreadful elitist experiment called the EU is a race to the bottom for all honest hard working taxpayers as the elite will flood the nations with mi grants which in turn will break down our individual fantastic diverse countries and turn Europe into a mass melting pot which will then make the masses easier to control. And the rich will get richer. It stops now.
pro	To summarize, we get control back of our own country. We get to decide immigration, not Brussels. So potentially we can almost completely stop immigration, or use Australia's points based system. Get rid of tons of pointless laws on various products, which big business loved, but which tends to kill off smaller innovative startups. Decisions won't be made by non-democratically elected bureaucrats in Brussels. Not sending countless millions to the EU every week. A chain reaction. If other countries also have an EU referendum, they also may get to leave too. The EU may die as a result.
pro	To the EU, tick tock ! Well done Boris on a great speech.
pro	To the people crowing about how horrible this is that the UK is leaving the EU, I wonder where they were when the EU was taking the UK's money but giving them nothing in return.
pro	To those resentful of the result: Please Google European army. Please try and imagine where that could lead a few years from now with the wrong president(s) in Brussels. Please also bare in mind that you have no vote at all over who is president in Europe.
anti	Today Brexit... and tomorrow everyone will still be shopping in Lidl & Aldi.
anti	Today I have my identity as an #EUCitizen stolen by a bunch of rich, right-wing shysters and gullible idiots.
anti	Today I see many of the things I believe in (solidarity, cooperation, internationalism) abandoned to follow the empty rhetoric of the past (national interest, sovereignty). My optimism tells me that we must fight and we can revert #Brexit in the future but today is a day of grief
anti	Today I‚Äôm disappointed and sad. I‚Äôm scared for my generation‚Äôs future and generations to come. Scientists receive so little funding from the UK we are very dependent on EU sources and collaboration. I won‚Äôt be surprised if over the coming years the UK‚Äôs output of original research falls because people, both European and British, choose to move and work elsewhere. I will likely be one of these people when I finish my PhD, I can‚Äôt imagine staying here where my work is not valued and every day is a fight to stay funded. I‚Äôm also sad that people have managed to be persuaded by the at times less than savoury leave campaign. ‚ÄòX‚Äô amount of money won‚Äôt be diverted back in to the NHS. We‚Äôve seen enough money-based promises that the government fails to go through with to know that. It is going to be very costly to maintain a decent position within finance and trade with the rest of the world. Also, immigrants are just as responsible for this country‚Äôs successe. They have given so much and continue to do so. Mainly, as citizens of the world, how can we turn away from people who are just looking for a better life and block ourselves off from the outside world?
anti	Today a young person hoping to go to University may chose to study at any University within The European Union. The cost of studying here is ¬£9000 a year. The cost of studying in Holland, for example ( where lectures are given in English ) is ¬£1200 a year. Total cost for a 3 year course in Holland : ¬£3 600. Total cost for a 3 year course in The UK : ¬£27 000. Tell me that hundreds of thousands of young voters, your children, will be better off if we leave The European Union.
pro	Today is a day to put all the battles behind us. All the divisions behind us. For everyone to come together. Let us celebrate and make the best of our future as Great Britain
anti	Today is a glorious day were leaving the EU this is the start of the UK going right down hill from hear on, the poor will get poorer the rich will get richer supermarket prices will go up there will be more poverty. Good bye safe doing ok Britain. Hello dangerous Chaotic and poorer Britain.
pro	Today is a good day. A great day. I'll savour every drop of remoaner tear. Cry me a river.31.01.2020 #BrexitDay
anti	Today is a real tragedy for the nation. I so sincerely hope they suffer as much as the rest of the less affluent population is going to suffer in the fallout after they have manipulated them for their own political ambition. Alas, I fear they won't give a damn because they have so much money in the bank they would not know what hardship feels like. You are too polite in calling them despicable :-).
anti	Today is a sad day. Brexit is what happens when a false sense of superiority combines with a false sense of victimhood. We should be reaching out to our European friends rather than walking away from them. It is better to be internationalist rather than isolationist.
anti	Today is a sad day. The UK has been a bit of a second home for me for years now. I lived in Edinburgh when the referendum happened. I've come to London to see theatre and to make theatre again and again while the Brexit date was pushed back again and again. Today feels unreal.
anti	Today is polling day. Vote for hope over fear, and because we need to build bridges, not burn them. #VoteRemain.
pro	Today is the UK's last day of being in EU.Our time has come
anti	Today is the beginning of UK self destruction
anti	Today marks the start of a new error in Britain‚Äôs history
anti	Today some British bank announced it was moving 190BLN of assets out of the UK to Ireland, because of Brexit.
anti	"Today we leave the EU - one of the world's biggest and most successful single markets. We start losing the freedom to live, study or work in Europe. We exit rules which cleaned our beaches, made our living standards better, stopped us working long hours, defined better rest periods and delivered over 50 years of peace, stability and prosperity. The media told us about ""mad EU rules"" that, in reality, our British MEP's voted on and accepted. They told us about blue passports which we could've had all along. They told us about the ""uncontrolled migration"" which, in reality, was allowed because our own government didn't apply EU migration rules properly. In charge, Boris Johnson - the man who lost a quarter of a million buying a water cannon. The gate is open and the horse has bolted. Good luck everyone."
pro	Today we throw off the shackles of tyranny and claim our country back.
anti	"Today's Financial Times front page ""Javid set to miss surplus target as finances head for ¬£12bn black hole"". More austerity or tax rises, or both? #r4today I reckon this #Brexit thing was not a wise idea."
anti	Today's the day! Britain is #StrongerIn - so #VoteRemain. If we vote to leave, there's no going back. Don't risk it
anti	Today, 100% of the population has been fucked over by 26% of the population at the behest of 1% of the population. Fuck Brexit.
anti	Today, I am disgusted to be British ... I resent what I thought was a minority in this country, ignorant people, but it seems fear tactics from the likes of Farage and Johnson have convinced people to ruin a future that doesn‚Äôt belong to them. As a teenager living in London, my future, and my friends‚Äô future, has been taken away from us and tossed into disarray by people who are completely alien from the things they are scared of. Immigration was never the problem, money was never going to go into the NHS, and we‚Äôre less ‚Äúfree‚Äù than we ever were with the financial and political crash that is happening. And all we can do as the progressive and inclusive youth of Britain is watch our elders destroy what little we had to build on. Seeing idiots like Farage call for ‚Äúindependence day‚Äù as the pound plummets makes me think that we were in a better place before we let bigots decide our future. I don‚Äôt know what to do, I sit here in awe of the place I am no longer proud to live in, surrounded by people I am no longer proud to be associated with. Fear has changed this country forever. I hope whoever voted leave is happy with the turmoil they‚Äôve sent us into.
pro	Today, the U.K. is the most bad ass region on the planet - a model for the rest of the world.
anti	Together we are stronger.
anti	Together we stand. Divided we fall - Pink Floyd, 1979.
anti	Together we stand. Divided we fall. Weakens the world, if you really leave.
anti	Tomorrow I wake up a year older and no longer an EU citizen. Worst birthday ever.
pro	Tomorrow dawns a New Day for all of Great Britain.
anti	Tomorrow morning I'll wake up a European Citizen with rights to work, live and travel across borders. But I'll go to bed with that stolen from me.
pro	Tomorrow night at 11pm the U.K. leaves the European Union...the doomsayers will be disappointed...I remain confident that the U.K. will do well as an independent sovereign state..
pro	Tomorrow we will see all the pollsters coming out with their predictions and Osborne continuing his lying with Cameron close behind. PLEASE REMEMBER If the UK remains in then political union and the demise of the UK as a country will be inevitable VOTE LEAVE to save your children's and your children's children's future from a despotic dictatorship lead by the unelected prolegariat based in Brussels
anti	Tomorrow, Britain needs to stand tall and #VoteRemain to protect the NHS, schools, workers rights and the economy. #EUref
anti	Tomorrow, we regroup and reunite to begin the fight to rejoin the EU.
anti	Tonight Brexiteers will creep down stairs and steal the dreams, hopes and wishes of future generations #BrexitEve
anti	Tonight I am stripped of my European citizenship against my wishes... tonight I am ashamed to be British and proud to be European and I always will be
anti	Tonight in a couple of hours I will no longer be a European, I will lose the right to work freely anywhere in Europ√©
pro	Tonight magic has happened. All remainers have been turned into leavers. Happy Brexit everybody.
pro	Tonight the silent majority celebrate - we have kept our powder dry for 3 years now, whilst every insult has been hurled at us by the so called elites, champagne socialists and the establishment traitors.
pro	Tonight we have left the EU - an extraordinary turning point in the life of this country. Let us come together now to make the most of all the opportunities Brexit will bring - and let‚Äôs unleash the potential of the whole UK.
pro	Tonight we have left the EU and will start a bright new chapter in the UK's history
pro	Tonight we have left the EU and will start a bright new chapter in the UK's history.
anti	Tonight's prayer - that my kids may get to see the UK returning to the European family
anti	Tonight, as the cold descends, there are people sleeping and dying on the streets of our cities in unprecedented numbers. While hateful, solipsistic narcissists drive the country ever onwards towards the needless catastrophe Brexit. Great God in Heaven, that makes me angry.
anti	Too bad Scotland‚Äôs vote wasn‚Äôt counted. I pray Northern Ireland‚Äôs border will be peaceful still.
pro	Too many Remainers' stupid analogies !! ‚ò∫üòäüòÄüòÅüòÇ
anti	Took some stuff to the local tailor today for repair. She‚Äôs Austrian, with a British Husband. Runs a small business in the Town and does great work. Chatting about #BrexitDay and she said yesterday a customer told her to ‚Äògo back to her own country.‚Äô This is what Brexit enables.
anti	Tories against Brexit
anti	Tories cut public funding, the EU increases public funding. Idiots vote to leave because of public funding cutd
anti	Tories talks about the people's choice yet the only leavers they are listening to are the rich, upper class, prejudice pricks who have never worked a day in their life
anti	Total waste of time and money! For a deal that will be worse than we have right now!!!!
anti	Totally agree that we ought to be doing more to train UK people to do these jobs. That doesn‚Äôt mean Brexit is a good idea though - especially a ‚Äòhard‚Äô or ‚Äòno deal‚Äô Brexit.
pro	Totally biased video for the stay campaign.....................Brexit is the only way to go,and go before we lose everything,which is what will happen if we stay...
anti	Totally depressing result, a sad day for Britain, the EU and future generations.....
pro	Tough luck Remainers, you have held this country back for almost four years now with your petty antics and blockades. It's our time to shine now and gain our rightful place on the world's economic and political stage. The sleep lion is about to roar.
pro	Trade is precisely about sovereignty. Follow my rules, and you can sell into my market. Don't and you can't. Only a fool would then decide to follow rules set by others, have disputes resolved by someone else's court or agree to any deal that comes with such constraints attached. May was such a fool, Boris isn't.
anti	Trade is vitally important, but also has Johnson got anything to say about social issues? Is it a UK objective to retain reciprocal healthcare arrangements for UK citizens who move to the EU after the transition period? Is it the UK‚Äôs intention to continue uprating with inflation the pensions of those citizens?
pro	Translate: You are one of those who loves Europe but loathes the glorious fascist EU and who refuses to recognise that our powerful and mighty EU will triumph over your puny democracy! Feel our EU jackboot in your face, vote-lover!
pro	"Translation: ""The world never existed before the EU, and without it photosynthesis will cease and all volcanoes will erupt. It's simply impossible for a country to exist and not be a part of it."""
pro	Treason May all her actions make sense if you think on the premise she was out to sabotage Brexit
pro	Treason May is trying her level best to sell out UK and sink Brexit. If Brexit gets postponed beyond 29th March, it will be a stab in the back of Brexiters and death of democracy.
pro	Trending now and forever more: #leavetheeufast
anti	"True - it is not about ""believing the EU above the UK"" it iabout beliving in the UK as part of the EU. No different from Yorkshore as part of England or Wales as part of the UK. If you feel different you have no right to argue at all about further power to the devolved assemblies or their total independance from the UK"
anti	"True stories: Leaver told me that he voted Brexit because he wanted his South African x-wife out of the country. Another one because she hated her Egyptian x-husband. ... and an EU national voted leave because her husband is Caribbean .. when I said what that means she said loudly ""I told you my husband is Caribbean !!"" .. go figure. Bottom line NONE of the above mentioned people have any clue or idea of what they voted for."
anti	True to the best, wise from our worst, for the UK there is no retreating from the EU, the world, the future.
anti	True. As a Californian I can say, with certainty: The only thing worse than an uninformed legislator making law is an uninformed citizen making law. Majority rule becomes mob rule (it's also how our legislature often ducks responsibility)
pro	True. The European Union is like a giant toilet pull where Muslims come to take super liquidy diareah shits. And you fuckers are stuck in this giant toilet bowl until you find a way out.
anti	"Truly extraordinary - 34.9% believe it would be ""good for Britain' to leave the EU with no alternative arrangements in place. That the Vote Leave campaign has been able to persuade such a significant portion of the electorate that having substantially all our very extensive cooperation agreements with our nearest neighbours, close allies and largest trading partners simply fall away would be positive is simply baffling. So self-evidently ridiculous."
pro	Truly inspirational. If he walks the walk as good as he talks the talk Boris is destined to become one of the UK‚Äôs best PMs we‚Äôve had since Maggie. I don‚Äôt think Barnier knows what he‚Äôs dealing with.
anti	Truly speaking the referendum was a scam, but Brits are too proud to admit it.?No wonder why so many people were tricked into voting leave.
anti	Trump and Brexit are part of the same right-populist resurgence that has been going on all around the developed world.
anti	Trump and Brexit; two of the worst ideas to have ever befallen English speaking voters. Both arriving out of the blue at the same moment in history like a sorcerer‚Äòs curse. Witch hunt indeed!
pro	Trump loves the UK more than May loves the UK. At least someone says it clearly.
anti	Trumpism and Brexit were rich man's revolution with populist mascarade at the cost of poor and old generation left-behinders. who thought that Donald Trump, Farage or Rees-Mogg care about them.
pro	Trust Thatcher's Guru and Vote OUT ! OUT ! OUT ! on the 23rd ! Make it OUR Independence Day !!!
pro	Truth is Interpol EU Nato UN: none of it makes you safe from a terrorist attack. #brussels Thoughts with families and emergency services
anti	"Try being Irish and watching what's going on. England is now fondly referred to here as our ""old enemy"" but our bond and cultural similarities have never been stronger in recent years. The Queen visited in 2011 and the relationship went from strength to strength. We are now (as it was throughout history) referred to as the ""Irish problem"" when speaking about the backstop. But the truth is we have always been aware of the English upper class arrogance and watching from here has been very frustrating. We are now directly going to be affected by the arrogance of the ""Britannia rules the waves"" mentality and we had no say. Thankful that Europe has had our back and hopeful that they will still have it once this goes completely pear shaped if certain people have their way."
anti	Trying to blackmail everybody to accept May's deal. Pretty obvious why it's being done.
pro	Trying to reform the EU is like trying to reform Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union. The EU is rotten from its core. It is a totalitarian bureaucratic dictatorship.
anti	Trying to see the positive in Brexit. All I‚Äôve got so far is that whenever anything shit happens because of it we get to shout ‚ÄúSUCK IT UP. YOU WANTED THIS‚Äù at Brexiteers.
anti	Turns out Brexit did not bring more security and stability. Who knew! Opportunity for a recession is still a big selling point I guess...?
anti	Two vanished comments in this thread already. How come we remainers get pelted with abuse by the brexiteers,but when i call them idiot potato-headed thugs i get deleted. They can‚Äôt take what they deal out to others. Cowardly Brexiteers. The UK hasn‚Äôt been so divided since the civil war.
pro	"Two words to the EU Commission and the first one starts with the letter ""F""!"
pro	Two years of project fear. Don‚Äôt let them win. This is what people need to know. Out means out 221747 it‚Äôs a Petition for out!
pro	Two years. of government and wrangling over deal or no deal , this government has wasted thousands of taxpayers money also waisted time, because they couldn't come up with a decision , the decision was Made at the beginning by the democratic referendum result, no deal . What a disgrace .
anti	Ty. That's perfectly honest Ahh...you forgot the Russia Report ! Where's the fucking Russia Report, Boris ?
anti	Typical anti-EU propaganda.
pro	Typical unelected Remaniac who wants to use every undemocratic deceit and cheat to subvert democracy. In the short term they may succeed but in a few years the political parties across Europe will be anti-EU. Even Germany.
anti	Tyrants! And take away American money, defence and protection, it will all fall apart!
pro	U have Ireland. If Britain want to trade with EU, they can just walk to Ireland to trade. They're not that far away from EU. It's just right next door. No big deal. I say it's a smart move. They can do what they want and trade.
anti	U.K IS DOOMED............leave while you still can,the place is finished.
pro	U.K. Independence Day should be a national holiday.
pro	U.K. was a lot way better before they joined the EU globalist
pro	UK IS BETTER OF ON IS OWN.. THANK YOU BRITAIN for leading by example .. u guys are going to be ok.. next make GOD a priority and the ppl of God..
pro	UK OUT OF EU!
anti	"UK PM Boris Johnson tells ""juvenile anti-Americans"" to ""grow up and get a grip"", as he sets out his vision for increased UK-US trade post-Brexit, adding ""the NHS is not on the table"" during negotiations"
pro	UK SHOULD LEAVE and Germany should do so too. I respect French culture, but France has no taste for politic and economy. That's why France tends to make united organizations like OECD, EU. „Éª„Éª almost forgot, German mates, you should never vote for Merkel
pro	UK US trade deal sounds good to me.
anti	UK and EU are already bullied by the US because of dollar and power. Further, Most of the American companies are called upon on the senate and questioned, US spies on allies. And they are threatening to the EU and Britain not give 5G to Huawei. Clearly shows where this is going. It's so funny when they talk about sovereignty.
anti	UK based suppliers - lead-time increase from 5 days to 4-6 weeks due to custom capacity shortages
pro	UK before EU: The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Rolling Stones, Yes, Led Zepplin, Jethro Tull, Genesis, The Kinks, ... UK in EU: One Direction Why did they wait so long to get out?
anti	UK came into EU with lots of misgivings and is now leaving it with even more misgivings!

pro	UK finally leaves the EU
pro	UK finally leaves the EU...wow that was almost as difficult as closing an AT&T account.
pro	UK get out of EU . Eu already said that was the only deal that u will get . U take it or u leave
anti	UK government keep rejecting calls for a second referendum. The best we can hope for at the minute is that the EU keep rejecting May‚Äôs ‚Äúrequirements‚Äù so that we end up in a political limbo. Worst thing is if May just throws her toys out of the pram, builds a wall separating NI and ROI and thus voiding the Good Friday Agreement. And we don‚Äôt want that. We still love you Ireland.
pro	UK grow a set and just leave NO DEAL WHATSOEVER What is the EU gonna do, attack you?
anti	UK had immigrants before EU , and migration will cintinue even after EU!Congratulations!
pro	UK has 460.000 sq miles of seas. No wonder EU is panicking about being kicked out. They should not be allowed to use even a fishing rod in our waters having plundered freely for 48 years imo. 100 of 120 coastal constituencies voted leave.
anti	UK has always been my favourite place to go. For over a decade now. But I think it's about time to say bye to my favourite country and take my money elsewhere. Good luck to you all!
anti	UK has full control over it's money, they did not need Brexit. They had full control already.
anti	UK has left the EU team, running away like cowards from shaping the future of our continent.
pro	UK has left the poor county EU now the Brits can enjoy with no head aches from bailing other countries from their misrible problems, thanks UK for being smart
pro	UK has left the poor county EU now the Brits can enjoy with no head aches from bailing other countries from there misrible problems, thanks UK for being smart
pro	UK has left the tyranny of Brussels, Happy Brexit Day!
anti	UK has no leverage over EU or the US. Definitely getting the short end on both fronts. Everyday brexit seems stupider and stupider
pro	UK imports to the EU are MUCH greater than imports. They are more reliant on us, so lets get out and decide our own future and also make the gravy that is needed.
pro	UK is LEAVING!! The end
anti	UK is a fool to leave
anti	UK is about to learn an important lesson - what happens when you give power to poets and historians.

pro	UK is getting ready to surrender its sovereignty and be governed by UNELECTED and UNACCOUNTABLE WTO bureaucrauts from Switzerland!
anti	UK is not leaving the EU ( still need to put to the budget for this year. Still need to follow EU regulations till end of the year ). What UK do they just leave from EU parliament and they do not have representative there. That‚Äôs it !
anti	UK is now the laughing stock of Europe
anti	UK is part of the European Union. Looking at the past decades at the level of fundamental values, the European Union has achieved peace, democracy and respect for human rights in a large and growing part of the continent of Europe. The UK‚Äôs secession would weaken this transformative achievement. Overall, the evidence supports a common-sense view that British interests are best served by continuing membership of the EU.
anti	UK is suddenly looking like a banana republic
pro	UK is the country that needs less from EU and was the most visioned country to live and work
pro	UK is the richest and strongest ¬†member of EU. We are a world power. ¬†It's better for UK to form it's own union with the Commonwealth states. UK with Australia and NZ. We can then have better control of immigration, trade and money. A much better alternative than trash EU!
pro	UK is too big, needs no one. Uk gonna make huge deals with the world, make a lot of money
pro	UK just got away from Future Northern ISIS...
anti	UK leavers must realise that they have walked away from 400 millions customers. Nothing can replace that, absolutely nothing. All that will happen is UK will have to adhere to CE quality control on all imports or UK get no access. It will be an EU red line.

pro	UK must be free of EU to regulate itself and trade around the globe
anti	UK need Eu more than Eu need UK
pro	UK needs to get out of EU and take back control. Needs a shrink and a long long time to heal.
pro	UK needs to leave the EU - everything will be the same. Trade/Travel/etc EXCEPT UK will better control its boarders! UK get your sovereignty back! It is most important, without that YOU DO NOT HAVE A COUNTRY!
pro	UK never fully embraced the EU anyway. ¬†Didn't switch to the Euro and many other things.
pro	UK out of the EU is a good thing, for Germany at least and most members, UK is too much a special snow flake so let them rely on the banking sector. Nothing can go wrong.
anti	UK politicians will always blame the EU, but themselves. Brexiteers would blame anyone, but themselves. Start taking responsibility for the mess you have made out of UK and the world. There is still time to stop it
pro	UK saved themselves at the end from ethnic genocide good job. Now send all the freeloaders from ME and Africa back.
anti	"UK seems to be wanting to revive the Empire days. not gonna happen. so what's now - isolated, spent to the outmost when it comes to ""being United Kingdom"" and with only friend Trump, who is a Laughing stock of the entire world?"
anti	UK shooting themselves in the foot like the US then claims victory :D lol rich
anti	UK should do new votings...will BREXIT be accepted by the people again?? I am not sure....
pro	UK should leave, they did great before EU crapheads.
pro	UK should now become fully independent and be the light in this dark world and the powerhouse economy of the world through proper manufacturing and business deals and NOT Through Banking and Speculation Trades.All the Best for the Uk.
anti	UK should stay in the EU, they need to grow and become a super-power once again. EU is not a Super-power without Britain.
anti	UK should've stayed. All those who wish ill for europeans are happy about you leaving. The Russians, the Arabs, the Chinese... wrong move. Now you're isolated and alone. What's it worth?
anti	UK stands at the crossroads - either cancel Brexit or ending up as puppet of Putin and Trump
anti	UK told by EU council that Brexit won‚Äôt work. What a fucking surprise
anti	UK trying to kick everyone but Europe still allows them free movement
anti	UK voted itself to irrelevance today. Or to put it more accurately... England. Scotland, Northern Ireland, and maybe even Gibraltar, will likely leave her soon.
anti	UK want to get out from EU and expect EU give them a better deal?? That's a bunch of non-sense expectation. If EU gives UK better deal, then more and more country will bail out, basically, kill themselves
pro	UK wants to leave EU because UK does not like the ways Brussel telling UK what to do.
pro	UK was always a great country don‚Äôt let it down now when it really needs his ppl u gotta be reasonable and except changes EU was greatfull to have UK on their side not the opposite UK is the greatest country on the world after USA so they have to start being that country
pro	UK was fine before EU and they will be fine after, just hope EU won't try to make things harder for UK in the future.. You know that those unelected bureaucrats at EU are worried that UK will be successful and that other European country will follow Britain's lead.
anti	UK was one of the countries I wanted to work as a researcher in the future. Now that is out of the EU, I'll have to focus on other countries. UK has just lost a bunch of important future workers with high GPD.
pro	UK was the second highest net contributor to the EU's budget after Germany
pro	UK will NOT regret it, no one has ever regretted more freedom and liberty.
anti	UK will be weaker at all levels , Political and Economic
anti	UK will fall hard
anti	UK will regret this. The EU is bigger than you and your economy depends heavily on the EU. What if they decide not to deal with you, what happens to your citizens. Has Johnson (Trump in disguise) thought of this?
anti	UK will still be in europe an island cant move.
pro	UK will take back evrything that belongs to UK
anti	UK's fighting among themselves, EU carries on, plans, makes business, signs trade deals etc. Well done Brextremists üëç
pro	UK, GET OUT NOW!!!!!!
pro	UK, get out now before they flood you with forced migration
pro	UK, how about LEAVE NOW? :D You voted, please act immediately!
anti	UK: I'm going to jump of this ship soon. I'm the best swimmer in the world, I won't even get wet, I don't like anybody on this ship and it will sink soon anyway. EU: we don't want you to jump but it's up to you. UK: and we want you to beg us to stay, a life jacket and free access to this ship without having to comply to the ship's rules. EU: actually you still owe us money so you won't get anything unless you pay. We created this ship together and we still think it's more safe than anything we had before but it's up to you. 3 years later: UK: OK, you had lots of chances to negotiate with me but you were not reasonable, I'm going to actually jump off ... and mark my words; if anything bad happens to me I'm going to blame YOU !
anti	UKs greatest import WAS cheap labour when they needed it

pro	USA and UK together against leftism, Post modernism and globalism.

pro	Uk keep on going and Bye bye Bureocrats Globalists!
anti	Uk should remain in EU
anti	Uk will fall again
pro	Unbelievable discussion... The chance for those in ‚Äòpower‚Äô to give ‚Äòpower‚Äô to the people is now. The Brexit vote goes to the heart of that. People voted to be given control over their laws, borders and money. So let‚Äôs stop talking about it and deliver it.
anti	Unbelievable that Brexiters think the EU can threaten the EU with not paying the ¬£39bn... it means nothing to the EU.
pro	Unbelievable welcomed sound.thank you Nigel,Boris & democracy.
anti	Unbelievable, just as unbelievable anything to do with brexit has been. This nonsense must end soon, brexit has failed on all counts.
anti	Under May‚Äôs plan, the size of the UK economy would be 3.9% smaller after 15 years, compared with staying in the EU, assuming some trade frictions and net zero inflow of EU migrants, according to an analysis by the UK Treasury.
anti	Under any scenario, the UK‚Äôs exit from the European Union will leave the country worse off.
pro	Understand this remaining fool. The economy was way down the list of reasons we voted to leave. Understand this remaining fool. It still is. Control of our borders, our laws and our lives came long before any financial risk
pro	Unelected bureaucrats making it difficult to leave their Union
anti	Unfair! I was a remainer living in a leave area.
anti	Unfortunately England has more than their fair share of bigots and morons.
anti	Unfortunately I think for a lot of Out people they feel like they have no control or ability to affect their lot and the Out campaign has done a good job selling the magic bean that is leaving the EU could be. If we leave I fear they will just be left holding the beans whilst the country becomes further divided.
anti	Unfortunately it will happen and it will be most unpleasant. An orgy of blitz inspired chauvinism and anti european sentiment.
anti	Unfortunately my passport renewal time is here and this #probrexit offering has arrived today üò¢ #Brexit #StillEuropean #ScotlandIsOpen #ScotlandLovesEU üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø üá™üá∫
pro	Unfortunately the media and all the luvvies were remoaners it will be their pathetic little stance ! Doesn‚Äôt change the fact we‚Äôre out the world hasn‚Äôt imploded and the interest rates are held in anticipation of an upturn in the economy !
anti	Unfortunately, more and more people in the EU are voicing joy about the UK leaving. It's a sad state of affairs, totally on the head of reckless Brexiteers. Maybe to should be taken to court for treason.
pro	Unfortunately, the EU Commission is not concerned with actual people or countries. They are there for 'The Project'. They've brought Europe the glories of the CAP and the Euro; who knows what they'll do next. But we can be sure it own't be logical or sensible.
anti	Unhappy Independence Day for us 48% that knows this is one big mistake Brexit. Celebrate today you regret it later
pro	United Europe turned into a dictatorship. The leave vote was a great decision. Britain is once again democratic.
pro	United Europe turned into a dictatorship. The leave vote was a great decision. Britain is once again democratic. Let's be clear it is not the voters that forced Britain to leave the EU, it was EU that forced the voters
pro	United Europe turned into a dictatorship. The leave vote was a great decision. Britain is once again democratic. Let's be clear it is not the voters that forced Britain to leave the EU, it was EU that forced the voters.
anti	United Ireland and an Independent Scotland now, leave England and Wales to their own self created destruction #ourdaywillcome
anti	United Kingdom is not so United :)
anti	United States of Europe is a good idea in the long term, don't know why people are so afraid of it.
anti	United we are strong, apart we fall apart
anti	United we are,better we are,no brexit..
anti	United we stand, divided we fall. This now applies to the world. The end is near? The world had better unite or it is all over folks.
anti	United we stand, separate we fail. It is always easy to leave the boat when it smells ashes but leaving is weak and selfish.
anti	United you stand. Divided you go extinct.
anti	United you stand. Divided you go extinct. Humans will never unite, so extinction it is. Just a matter of time. Mark my words.
anti	Unless the British government changes its stance on Brexit sharpish I don't imagine that the uk as we know it will exist in ten years. If Theresa May wants to be remembered as the PM who destroyed the UK then she should keep to her present course. If that's not how she'd like us to think of her in our dotage then a new approach would be wise.
anti	Unless the EU collapses in the next crisis the UK shot themselves in the face.
anti	Unless you are a Farage or Rees Mog, and have plenty of cash riding on the outcome, the results are a disaster.
pro	Unlike you, I, in my very early 30's, deplored the attempts to join the Common Market and in particular, Mr Heath's lies about no loss of sovereignty when he took us in without consulting us. I seized the opportunity to vote to leave in 1975, but was outvoted. Everything I feared then, over the next 40 years happened, though even I had not foreseen the madness of the common currency. I have to say I did foresee all the other ghastly things that have happened like the corruption and the profligacy, like the ECJ and the toothless parliament. Thank God we are now out.
anti	Unlucky üá¨üáß
pro	Unraveling of the EU wouldn't lead to the dissolution of the EU. It'll become something like the Eurzone, a club of nations where there's no rules other than the whims of the German Chancellor
anti	Until last week, we were full members. We are still in transition. You chose vassalage, supposedly well aware of what that would entail, and now you‚Äôre complaining! Brexilogic.
anti	Until the government solidify a position of what post EU Britain will be and what they are going to change their are no pros that are in anyway measurable or even realistic at this stage.
pro	Up n at em!! Wonderful morning here, lovely bath this morning, soaked in those left wing remainer tears! #NeverCorbyn #BackBoris #ProBrexit #goodbyecultofcorbyn
pro	Up until we joined this federalist-inclined, supra-national superstate, we controlled our own destiny and made peace and war in Europe according to what policy best furthered our interests.
anti	Urgh, what a shit show from our government. If it helps i'm not merely saying sorry, i'm trying to convince my family in preparation for any kind of democratic process that might reverse the damage i contributed to.
pro	Us Americans are so happy for Britain!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!!! FREEDOM IS YOURS!
anti	Use your brain - vote Remain .
anti	Use your brain and vote Remain fellow UK citizens! Bremain 2016
anti	Usual empty rhetoric. We all know the Tories have nothing to offer this country, just vampires sucking the life out of it. Go back to your (not very) special place in hell traitors.
anti	Utter rubbish
pro	VOTE BREXIT let us have our FREEDOM and DEMOCRACY back from the (EUSSR).
anti	VOTE IN
pro	VOTE LEAVE ! DODGY DAVE CANNOT BE TRUSTED , BRITISH PEOPLE NEED TO TAKE CONTROL ! WE CANNOT TRUST A MAN THAT LIES AND HAS GIVEN FALSE PROMISES OVER AND OVER AGAIN.......

pro	VOTE TO EXIT
pro	VOTED TO LEAVE THE EU - NOT STAY INSIDE IT
pro	Verhofstadt..is right on some points.[i am leaver]
anti	Vernon Dursley would vote #Brexit , do you really want to be on the same side as him
pro	Very biased anti Breit propaganda: disgusting!
anti	Very few of the people who voted for Brexit will realise the cost of Brexit. Once it becomes impossible to deny things have got worse, their media will find a non-Brexit scapegoat. A news outlet whose demographic is strongly Brexit isn't going to tell their readers Brexit (and therefore their own action) ¬†is the cause of their problems. The readers won't accept it, they'll just switch to someone with a different story that doesn't make them feel bad.
anti	Very few people understood what they were voting for
pro	Very happy about it. And not just because it gets us out of the EU, but also cause the radical progressives and socialists got crushed in the election.
pro	Very happy for the UK! But I hope you're ready to fight, cuz now they're gonna tear Scotland out of the UK.
pro	Very happy for them !!
pro	Very interesting to see that many who regret our departure from the EU are still posting furiously. Listen chaps, you‚Äôre talking to the air now; since the election you have been politically castrated. We have left the EU and any subsequent negotiations with the EU will be conducted without your influence. We know you expect, and indeed secretly hope, that this all ends in tears, but frankly we do not believe you, and even if there are problems we regard our national independence to be of greater importance. Goodbye and good riddance.
pro	Very powerful article. Remoaners should read it and be ashamed. But they probably won't. We ordinary British already
pro	Very proud to finally have the Prime Minister we‚Äôve been waiting for!!
anti	Very sad indeed. One day we will return EU
anti	Very sad indeed. One day we will return EU.
anti	Very sad indeed. One day we will return EU.!
anti	Very sad, I hope we can all strive forward and that England does not become a poor country as it was before we joined the European union I have made some great friends from Europe
pro	Very well done Prime Minister,the people are behind you
pro	Victory after over 40 years of battling for self-government!
pro	Victory for Freedom! As I have been asking for years, we must now have the same referendum in France and EU countries.
pro	Viva La Brexit

pro	Vote Leave people,This is the battle of Britain,we must win this or there was no point in the 100,000s of lives lost fighting to keep us free from another regime which wanted to rule us.VOTE LEAVE.
pro	Vote Leave to get outr country back and to stop Disgustin Dave and Cleieless Giddeon back in power.
pro	Vote Leave!
pro	Vote Leave! Get out while you still can
pro	Vote Leave. Everything they are saying is lies used to manipulate you through usage of the mainstream media.
anti	Vote Leave.. For a return to dirty beaches and polluted rivers , erosion of workers rights oh but we wil get our empire back
pro	Vote OUT of the EU.
pro	Vote OUT this country is well over crouded, pisses me right off, there isnt any room for us home birds anymore, all jobs are taken we need out, they dont pay for the NHS where as we have to pay to go abroad, its discusting STOP LETTING OTHERS IN
anti	Vote Remain For all our sakes.
anti	Vote Remain today for more jobs, money, trade and to keep our border in Calais, not have it back in Dover #StrongerIn #VoteRemain
anti	Vote for #hope; Vote for #love; Vote for #unity #VoteRemain #StrongerIn
pro	Vote for Brexit and freedom.
pro	Vote for Brexit, or F√ºhrer Merkel will rule the island!
pro	Vote for leaving EU enough is enough.....British future is doomed if we stay
anti	Vote for my deal and then we'll open the magic box.....Is that it??? #Brexit
anti	Vote in! Leaving would be an act of economic self-harm, the main arguments for Brexit are jokes and exaggerations.
pro	Vote is closed. The full time result is up. Remainers 0 Brexit 1. Losers what you trying to change. You lost the match. You dont like it then go away.
pro	Vote leave and save our wonderful country before the EU completely dismantle her !
pro	Vote leave and take back your democracy.
anti	Vote leave is not been honest with the public people could lose their jobs some company make go if UK exit I bet is the poor people going to suffer politicians don't tell the truth they do what's best for them
pro	Vote leave mainly because Cadbury moved factory to Poland 2011 with EU grant. Ford Transit moved to Turkey 2013 with EU grant. Jaguar Land Rover has recently agreed to build a new plant in Slovakia with EU grant, owned by Tata, the same company who have trashed our steel works and emptied the workers pension funds. Peugeot closed its Ryton (was Rootes Group) plant and moved production to Slovakia with EU grant. British Army's new Ajax fighting vehicles to be built in SPAIN using SWEDISH steel at the request of the EU to support jobs in Spain with EU grant, rather than Wales. Dyson gone to Malaysia, with an EU loan. Crown Closures, Bournemouth (Was METAL BOX), gone to Poland with EU grant, once employed 1,200. M&S manufacturing gone to far east with EU loan. Hornby models gone. In fact all toys and models now gone from UK along with the patents all with with EU grants. Gillette gone to eastern Europe with EU grant. Texas Instruments Greenock gone to Germany with EU grant. Indesit at Bodelwyddan Wales gone with EU grant. Sekisui Alveo said production at its Merthyr Tydfil Industrial Park foam plant will relocate production to Roermond in the Netherlands, with EU funding. Hoover Merthyr factory moved out of UK to Czech Republic and the Far East by Italian company Candy with EU backing. ICI integration into Holland‚Äôs AkzoNobel with EU bank loan and within days of the merger, several factories in the UK, were closed, eliminating 3,500 jobs Boots sold to Italians Stefano Pessina who have based their HQ in Switzerland to avoid tax to the tune of ¬£80 million a year, using an EU loan for the purchase. JDS Uniphase run by two Dutch men, bought up companies in the UK with ¬£20 million in EU 'regeneration' grants, created a pollution nightmare and just closed it all down leaving 1,200 out of work and an environmental clean-up paid for by the UK tax-payer. They also raided the pension fund and drained it dry. UK airports are owned by a Spanish company. Scottish Power is owned by a Spanish company. Most London buses are run by Spanish and German companies. The Hinkley Point C nuclear power station to be built by French company EDF, part owned by the French government, using cheap Chinese steel that has catastrophically failed in other nuclear installations. Now EDF say the costs will be double or more and it will be very late even if it does come online. Swindon was once our producer of rail locomotives and rolling stock. Not any more, it's Bombardier in Derby and due to their losses in the aviation market, that could see the end of the British railways manufacturing altogether even though Bombardier had EU grants to keep Derby going which they diverted to their loss-making aviation side in Canada. 39% of British invention patents have been passed to foreign companies, many of them in the EU The Mini cars that Cameron stood in front of as an example of British engineering, are built by BMW mostly in Holland and Austria. His campaign bus was made in Germany even though we have Plaxton, Optare, Bluebird, Dennis etc., in the UK. The bicycle for the Greens was made in the far east, not by Raleigh UK but then they are probably going to move to the Netherlands too as they have said recently. Anyone who thinks the EU is good for British industry or any other business simply hasn't paid attention to what has been systematically asset-stripped from the UK. Name me one major technology company still running in the UK, I used to contract out to many, then the work just dried up as they were sold off to companies from France, Germany, Holland, Belgium, etc., and now we don't even teach electronic technology for technicians any more, due to EU regulations. I haven't detailed our non-existent fishing industry the EU paid to destroy, nor the farmers being paid NOT to produce food they could sell for more than they get paid to do nothing, don't even go there. I haven't mentioned what it costs us to be asset-stripped like this, nor have I mentioned immigration, nor the risk to our security if control of our armed forces is passed to Brussels or Germany. Find something that's gone the other way, I've looked and I just can't. If you think the EU is a good idea, 1/ You haven't read the party manifesto of The European Peoples' Party. 2/ You haven't had to deal with EU petty bureaucracy tearing your business down. 3/ You don't think it matters.
pro	Vote out
pro	Vote stay if you hate your country.
anti	Vote stay, don't let the white man run your life.
pro	Vote to LEAVE the EU.
pro	Vote to leave is like vote for freedom
pro	Vote to leave is like vote for freedom ;) HOPE BRITISH PEOPLE WILL DECIDE FOR FREEDOM!!!
anti	Vote to stay in the EU!
pro	Vote ukip and make britain great again.
pro	Voted leave, no regrets. Economic instability was expected, media is overhyping it.
pro	Voted to leave. Not some half assed deal. Free of all EU institutions, our laws, our ¬£, our borders, our waters.
anti	Voting for Brexit is like voting for TRUMP.
anti	Voting for Brexit was the second worst voter decision in history.
anti	Voting remain because the EU brought better human rights is like voting for Labour because it brought the NHS.
pro	Voting remain won't even maintain the weird status quo we have at the moment which is the result of brushing all sorts of dreadful issues and decisions under the rug until we have voted. Anyone who votes remain will watch a horror unfold as Europe shafts us before falling apart.
anti	Voting remain, it's pretty like that if with leave, Scotland will want independence in order to be in the EU. This will result in a constant Tory government as Scotland's vote for Labour is vital in preventing the Conservatives (as can be seen in the last election). Being from the North, that idea terrifies me
anti	Voting requires adequate information, a good grasp of the facts and basic common sense.brexit was based on poor and unreliable information, lack of knowledge, denial of facts and the results defied all common sense.
anti	Voting to leave just because of immigration is a really dumb thing to do, you have to look at the others ways, at economic reasons it would be better to stay in the EU, since many migrants pay more taxes than british people.
pro	Voting to leave the EU to protect British workers and our NHS, Stop TTIP, Regain our sovereignty and self determination.
anti	Voting to leave the EU was foolhardy
pro	Voting to leave, voting for a United Kingdom, voting for self government, voting for a say in the laws and policies my government brings in, voting for no taxation without representation, voting for accountability for laws brought in, voting for control of the borders to keep out foreign criminals and terrorists, voting to control the numbers of economic migrants to the UK, voting for self determination, voting for my country, voting for liberty, voting for our laws, voting for the right not to be ruled by foreigners.
pro	Voting to remain in the EU is like chickens voting for KFC.
anti	Voting to stay in. We are stronger in Europe - not just economically. The EU is an amazing thing - all these countries who've fought each other - working together. I'm proud to be English & I'm proud to be part of the EU too.
anti	Voting to stay, not least because it makes the most sense politically, economically and otherwise, but also because the leave campaign seems to be pointing a lot of fingers without really offering solutions. It's important to know what you stand for, not just what you stand against. Many British ties to European have been renegotiated anyway, so a large part of problems those in favour of Brexit seem to point out will be resolved through that. Much of the rest of their problems are issues like UK nationals living abroad 'draining' health care resources, which, to me, doesn't really have too much to do with whether or not Britain is part of the EU.
pro	Vox You didn't mention the Eu also controls the 60% of laws and wish to have more power. The right to be governed by the people you elect is what England voted for.
pro	W.T.O is the best and only way for the uk that‚Äôs what we voted for
pro	WAVE those flags high Brits! Congratulations FREEDOM RINGS!
pro	WE ARE BRITISH It will be harder for Britain .We will have to make do a lot . But we need a kick ,we sold of all our industries and allowed the rich to sit back in comfort . Its time to think ahead and long term planning just as Germany did .Stop being run by accountants looking at a single years profit . Its time to look after the people and work for a better future

pro	WOOP WOOP!!
pro	"WOW--Where did all the LEADERS and INFLUENCERS GO---As LEAVING THE EU caused our TITLED COMMENTATORS to desert the UK, because now we REAL BREXIT BRITONS will have no one to show and demonstrate our superior mental agility and knowledge.---Ah -almost forgot--there is still the matter of stopping a certain EU tyrant called Martin Selmayr --who ( allegedly ) had a Grand father who was jailed for war crimes, this Mr Selmayr as given himself the top job by the side of Mr Juncker as 2IC to the EU executive.---He is a NOTED ANGLOPHOBE-- a man with no liking of Great Britain or America--no doubt fully due to the good flogging the war time Allies gave to the arrogant NATIONAL ""Socialist"" hierarchy of Hitlers German war machine.--Some Memories take a long time to disappear, and no doubt Britain's past success's will be a hard bit for Herr Selmayr, and many other EU officials, to swallow."

pro	WTO Australia style is fine for UK
pro	WTO is the way to go
pro	WTO, the way to go!¬†No foreign power making 70% of our laws.¬†No undemocratic Empire.¬†Nobody telling us who can live here.¬†No British blood spilt on whatever Imperialist adventure the Grande Armee Morgherini embarks on.¬†I humbly suggest other captive nations examine the implications of their own predicament.
pro	Wait until the US signs a trade deal with Britain. It'll make the EU look like a two bit flea market. And best part is we won't tell you how to run your country.
anti	Wait, so are people actually stupid enough to believe that the Conservatives are going to bring economic justice northern England? Hahaha yeah whatever you say, buddy
anti	Wait... Brits were celebrating driving their economy off a cliff?
pro	Waiting for definitive Brexit...
anti	Waiting for the news about starvation
anti	Wake up to reality, Corbyn hasnt done ANYTHING to stop Brexit during the referendum campaign and anything now to try to avoid it or reverse it. he is a backless man with not leadership skills, whi changes his ideas like the wind and who dosent represent us remainers...HE AS GUILTY AS THE TORIES FOR bREXIT ...I say this and I am a Labour supporter
anti	Waking up this morning, it is heartbreaking to see my news feed is full of thoroughly dejected people. Most of these are young, intelligent and passionate, individuals who were determined to support integration, tolerance and compassion. Yet, our futures have been governed by the votes of narrow-minded older generations who now will sit back and see our bright futures dimmed. I am embarrassed and disappointed that our country has been manipulated by the xenophobic, racist and above all incorrect facts that have been spread. Nigel Farage stated that leaving the EU is a victory for the ordinary, decent people ‚Äì today I am proud to be exceptionally indecent.
anti	Wales &Scotland DO NOT WANT BREXIT and much of N.Ireland if wasn't for the Ulster loyalist to the crown. REVOTE have another REFERENDUM!! The first was like 2016 USA presidential election where nearly 25% or more didn't vote LAZY thinking the crazy impossible would never get selected.
anti	Wales voted for Brexit. WTF were they thinking?
pro	Walk away
pro	Walk away now!!!
pro	Walk away, pay NOTHING. What can Barnier or the EU do about it? Nothing but weep. Absolutely sick oft these EU nasties, Everything that has happened over the past few weeks demonstrates that we are right to just GET OUT.
anti	Wankers voted to leave
anti	Want a no deal to happen so Britain learns they are not the centre of the universe.
anti	Wanted to move to the UK? Good! Don't you know all immigrants are useless eastern european muslims? /s Seriously, this fucking referendum. I wanted to come to the UK to study at Oxford (dream of mine), I am now scared of all the Xenophobia. Fuck this :(
pro	Watch the EU begin to crumble now.
pro	Watch us go from strength to strength without the shackles
anti	Watched the news yesterday and they interviewed some people in in pro Brexit areas as to what their thoughts wereAlmost all responses involved either:Happy we won't be oppressed by Euro law anymoreHappy we won't send Brussels money anymoreYet none of them could actually explain what laws oppressed them (and yes they really used the term oppressed) or how knew much money the UK got from Europe.The most telling bit was when it was pointed out that one of the big subsidized projects in Cornwall would no longer get money from the European grant the response was: Well then our government will just have to fund that.I honestly cannot wait for the boomer generation to no longer be part of the electorate.
anti	Watching in horror from Canada, I just feel sorry for all the decent people of Britain. All 48% of ‚Äòem.
anti	Watching the #BrexitCelebration last night I was overwhelmingly saddened by how ugly the UK has become and I am deeply worried by how much worse it will now become

pro	We Leavers are not interested in what Adonis thinks or wants, he‚Äôs a bit late we had the Referendum in 2016 and this is just an excuse to stop Brexit. Well, if you spit in the face of 17.4 million voters who won the Referendum don‚Äôt be surprised when there is a monumental backlash. BEWARE WHAT YOU DO.

pro	We all know the EU make the rules and the EU break the rules ..
anti	We already are a sovereign country, which is why we can make the decision to leave in the first place. All this decision has done is make the UK the laughing stock of the world.
pro	We already decided to leave. So leave without deal. We heard a lot of scaremongering. We voted to leave.
anti	We already had a People's Vote. I voted for remain and lost. I respect the result. Politicians should do the same.

anti	We already have the best trade deal we‚Äôre ever going to have with the EU, and we now know we‚Äôre walking away from that in March next year.
pro	We already know they don't care about us, they just want to keep us under thier thumb so they can drain us dry. We must leave asap without a deal, keep our money and regain everything we've lost.
pro	We already voted out so no deal it is. This is so biased against democracy it‚Äôs laughable
anti	We always said - long before the idea of Brexit took shape - that it is in our interests to have a united, strong, and most importantly independent European Union
pro	We are 100% better off outside the EU. I am sure Boris will get the best deal he can, but we can help ourselves by buying British and supporting our own farmers and producers.
pro	We are a beacon of hope to people right across Europe who are trapped in the EU and hate it.
anti	We are a laughing stock with no real leaders.
pro	We are a power house without the EU. More powerful than the EU. The EU makes nation states weaker
anti	We are all going to die if we leave the eu.
pro	We are an independent country once again
anti	We are being ignored as are the majority of people . Brexit is not the will of the people.
pro	We are better off without each other and the EU can run free with it's huge north/south divide and mass youth unemployment.
pro	We are bogged down with the rest of the world, most of them don‚Äôt like English people,so it‚Äôs time to leave
anti	We are cancelling Brexit, get over it.
anti	We are doomed
anti	We are encouraging people negatively affected by Brexit to come together and demand that our voice is heard by Westminster to prevent constitutional carnage and the removal of our rights.
pro	We are fed up with being disdained and ignored over the issues about which we feel strongly
pro	We are finally Free! Free at last!
pro	We are finally leaving the EU we should be celebrating
anti	We are free..... More like we are fucked
anti	We are fucked! We must have a second referendum
pro	We are fully aware that mass immigration by incompatible people is the EU's covert plan to destroy our way of life & Christianity prior to the end goal - World Government.
pro	We are going to be an independent self governing nation again. You would do well to try it also.
anti	We are going to end up with no deal, they'll (Johnson's gang) just call it something else and blame everyone but themselves
anti	We are gone from the EU. now we are going to get no help with the coroner virus thx brexit we are all dead

anti	We are leaving EU soon, Crap
pro	We are leaving because its the most sensible thing to do
anti	"We are leaving the civilised world why? Because Britain has become a ""scaredy cat"" it seems a huge number of our people are scared of foreigners and don't seem confident in themselves to compete with them so have picked up their toys and ""run'd away""What has become of our once great nation that we don't want to join in but want to hide by ourselves in the corner making snide remarks about others"
pro	We are leaving the sinking EU.
pro	We are not Europeans and we don't feel European, end of!

anti	We are not leaving the #EU. We are being forced out. Against our will. By a cabal of right wing ideologues, kleptocrats, swindlers, con artists, shills, fraudsters, criminals, liars, mobsters, and snake-oil salesmen.
anti	We are not on our own - there are millions of us - we are the majority of the country - and every political party except the Tories (who are solely responsible for this mayhem) and DUP (who have taken a bung) (and a very small group of myopic Labour MPs) want to stop Brexit so take courage and get organised to save our country from Tory perfidy and mendacity
pro	We are now our own country again and the the Queens English is the spokken tongue hear!
pro	We are now out - so WE determine what WE want to accept...or not accept. & to all Returners (formally know as Remainers), you can stop taking the EU's side now - we are out...gone...& not going back!!!
pro	We are one of the main financial contributors to the EU
anti	We are one of them (and we design and build exhibitions all over the EU, buy one product from Belgium supplier, sell it to UK, France, Spain... and work a fair bit in Germany. Economic ‚Äòbumps‚Äô are secondary to sovereignty. We recover from the former, never from the latter.
pro	We are out of Schengen, we are out of he Euro and come 29th march 2019 we are out of the Eu ... Once we are out, if the people are ever so stupid as to vote back in we would have to give up the pound. and harmonise our taxes to the Eu , the end aim is total and complete Political union . Where we are may not be totally perfect but the other direction to leaving on 29th March 2019 is one I never want to go down.
pro	We are out!!!
pro	We are right to LEAVE, enough is ENOUGH, we've been shafted from pillar to post by Europe, forced to take in unreasonable numbers of people, being told what we can and can't do etc.
pro	We are right with you Boris, only Politician we can rely on at present to deliver what we wanted, the rest are a bloody disgrace to public service. They have failed, failed and failed again.
anti	We are so fucked.
pro	We are so happy that the Will of the British People prevailed and Brexit was done!!
anti	We are still Europeans they cant take that from us sad day
pro	We are still apart of NATO. GCHQ, Mi5 and Mi6 are not useless. Lock down our boarders, deal with internal threats and continue giving information to shengan. Keep calm and Leave the EU.
pro	We are still leaving the rotten EU and there is nothing you remainers can do about it!
anti	We are the in and a major contributor. But certain things need to change to make things better for all. But we need to stay in or else we will loose out big time.
anti	We are to face a risk of a cliff edge, in particular for trade.
pro	We are ‚Äòtaking back control‚Äô
anti	We aren't out yet my friend,and i hope to god we can yet remain. I voted to stay.
pro	We as a country that can do so much.... make it a good place for business to flourish, good well paid jobs will follow and then we can sit back and watch the eu scratch around for what's left..... good riddance to the eurocrats.
pro	We as one in a year will be a force to be reconstructed to the power of what we were never released to be.now WE CAN SAY WITH PRIDE ONCE AGAIN WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER..‚Ä¶
pro	We awake to a free, independent country. Well done everyone!
anti	We came, we saw, we marched. Such love, unity and sunshine. Magical day.#PeoplesVote¬†#BetterTogether¬†#StopBrexit
pro	We can all begin our own personalt Brexit right now with our individual spending preferences. Boycott EU goods and services. You know it makes sense.
anti	We can destroy Brexit by a thousand cuts. Strengthen ties with the EU as individuals, parties, groups and companies - let's bypass the UK government as much as possible.
pro	We can do without a lying self-serving MP representing local constituents. Bring back Julian Brazier - a true Brexit supporter.
pro	We can leave without a deal and pay nothing - what can the EU do about it - they will be bankrupt without our cash within weeks,
pro	We can only hope now that Britain will be great.
pro	We can sue the EU for our ¬£60 Billion in assets and money under International Law and we would win.
anti	We can't now stop #Brexit. The UK has left the EU. But, every single person who cares about our country should be supporting the government getting the best possible deal with the EU before the end of the transition period. Anyone who disagrees with this is not a true patriot!
pro	We can't trust the EU, we have never been able to trust the EU, They have no respect for the UK, So please stop refering to them as our freinds. The Ink is hardley dry on the W.A.and they are already gonig back on what they have agreed. As they have already broken the agreement we are fee to walk away.
pro	We cannot fight from within, we tried that for many years and got nowhere. Germany and France hold too much power for us to do anything.
pro	We cannot surrender our destiny to the unelected of Europe.
anti	We can‚Äôt vote our way out of this. We are, always will be European.
anti	We champion freedom - but Brexit will mean the next generation is less free to live, work and love across Europe.
pro	We control the money! Yippee!
pro	We did not even have a chance to join the EU, they just made us and now we have to pay millions
anti	We did not make any promises other than brexit will be a disaster in about 3-10 years that any GCSE student of modern global business studies will likely tell you why..
pro	We did quite well before we joined the EU with the Commonwealth. We never did like to be dictated to and that‚Äôs what the EU is, a dictatorship.
anti	We did what, goodbye Britain the final death knell has sounded
pro	We didn't 'enjoy the benefits of membership'.¬† That's why we left.
pro	We didn't loose Europe , we fought tooth and nail to get out
pro	We didn't loose Europe , we fought tooth and nail to get out.
pro	We didn't vote for a deal, we voted to LEAVE,
pro	We didn't vote for deals we voted out so NO deal OUT, Eu sinister club is falling in more ways than one, it will be gone soon.
pro	We didn't vote for deals we voted out so NO deal OUT.
pro	We didn't vote to do deals we voted to leave the sooner we leave the sooner we get back to full employment
anti	We didn‚Äôt transfer our powers to Brussels. We carried our powers to Brussels, and used them there, for the good of all Europe, for nearly half a century. Now this era of contribution has come needlessly to an end. I‚Äôm angry. And heartbroken.
pro	We do NOT want continued instructions off the EU. We do NOT want level playing fields as that takes away the benefits of being a FREE and independent COUNTRY again. We can sustain a few blips after we gain our freedom in Dec 2020. It is NOT our responsibility to pay in yet more money into the EU to save Germany, Italy and Greece from recession and the EU from possible collapse.
pro	We do not need to stay close to the EU. Why would we want to do that after all these years of wanting to LEAVE. As a Back Bencher you have very little to say that any one would want to hear. You replacement has now been selected. It is time to nip home and start packing.
pro	We do not owe or trust the Merchants of greed, this is not about the British brexit they fear, but the aspirations of the rest of Europe, to free itself of a morally corrupt, and anti democratic EU.
pro	We do not want or need a second vote, no matter what the 'Economist' says! We voted OUT!
anti	We don't need Extra Time. About time we blew the whistle for Full Time and cancelled the disastrous fiasco that is Brexit
pro	We don't need a deal! We must LEAVE without a deal as said. Simple there is no other option.
pro	We don't need a trade deal with the EU we can be also more competitive without one. The EU needs a trade deal as it's worth ¬£80 billion to them but only about half that to us so when they speak of level playing field the need to look at the deficit on us caused by them.
anti	We don't need food.We can eat fresh brexit.?
pro	We don't need the EU.
pro	We don't need the EU. We can trade with China. And get out of NATO too while we are at it
anti	We don't need to leave the EU to fix our problems.
anti	We don't technically have to leave as the referendum wasn't legally binding. The government could just go for a soft brexit where they remain in the European Economic Area or just ignore the brexit and hope that the deciding 2% changed their minds.
anti	We don't want Brexit.This will destroy the england.
pro	We don't want a backstop, we don't want an agreement, we just want out. We want out immediately.
pro	We don't want a bloody deal just get us out
pro	We don't want an United Europe, under EU leadership the common man and women in all EU nation states are tired of unelected regulation. The only benefit is the visa free travel, but that also allows radicalized individuals to travel throughout Europe under the radar, it's what led to the Rotherham rapes here in the UK, The issues in Koln, Sweden becoming the rape Capitol of Europe. This vote was half to do with immigration reform and half to do with us in the middle classes being tired of being ruled by an unelected bureaucracy in Brussels where they can't even properly police the area around Brussels and have caused massive debts to be accumulated by private banks that hurt the EuroZone economically. This is a needed change, it's time to tear down the EU and rebuild the country's inside the EU to be self-sufficient while partnering with other European countries in order to maintain true stability for the common man.
pro	We don't want out... we want out out!!! EU has cancer... get out before it spreads to the UK!
pro	We don't want the Euro (‚Ç¨) thats why we quit. We like our Pound(¬£).¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£
anti	We don't want to leave the EU Your only judging us stop it
pro	We dont like STRANGERS in our local england do we tubs?,this is a local country for local people!
anti	We don‚Äôt need to leave the EU to control immigration, Mrs May!
pro	We don‚Äôt want more European integration and that‚Äôs exactly the course the EU is hell bent upon. Indeed it has to integrate further to protect the Euro and we didn‚Äôt want to join the Euro
pro	We don‚Äôt want the EU
pro	We don‚Äôt want to rejoin because nobody wants to be in a federal Europe.
pro	We eat our fish and EU eats theirs. BTW, EU catch more fish in UK waters that UK catch in EU waters
pro	We fought a war to defend our borders. We lost the war, when we joined the former EEC, which was the brainchild of the Nazis.
pro	We fought a war with you for independence Britain Nobody understands its importance better than America Vote #Brexit #VoteLeave üá¨üáß
pro	We get what we voted for and no billions go to the EU !
pro	We got out just in time
pro	We grow build and prosper for ourselves again :) A brighter future ;)
pro	We had a BREXIT in 1776. Things worked out pretty well not having a foreign power lord over us and taxing us.
pro	We had a vote no deal bye bye EU adi√≥s amigos üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
pro	"We had an empire before the ""EU"" came into the picture."
pro	We had the people's vote - called Brexit
pro	We had the people's vote - called Brexit.
pro	We hand over ¬£55 Million every day to be told how to behave! There is nothing about this EU that attracts.
pro	We have NO chance of a new style government whilst we are members.. LEAVE and then take control of our political elite .. The ones we can vote IN or OUT at elections‚Ä¶ But if we remain than bad government is what we will get forever. VOTE LEAVE
pro	We have a government that will make a success of Brexit. It's also the first one in many decades that I haven't completely despised.
pro	We have a massive trade deficit with the EU...we spend billions more importing than we export to the EU. If we refuse to give the ¬£39 billion, and withdraw our trade...the EU will implode and come back cap in hand begging for trade deals...this isn¬øt rocket science.
anti	We have already seen a huge drop in investment in the UK - and Brexit hasn't even started yet.
anti	We have already seen a huge drop in investment in the UK - and Brexit hasn't even started yet. If our MPs don't let the people vote on #Brexit they will be held responsible for ignoring warnings from business leaders like Tom Enders.
pro	We have already voted for brexit what is this man talking about ?
anti	We have an agreement with the Faroe Islands! What a mess. Britain seems intent on committing economic suicide but at least the migrants will stop coming when it all hits the fan, and it will hit the fan.
pro	We have become a sovereign country again after 47 years of deception by our political class, may that pave the way for freedom & justice for all, even those who opposed it, many thanks to those who stood up to the abuse, your efforts have been rewarded!
pro	We have been absolutely overrun with EU migrants, more so than any other EU member state, and we're told how wonderful this is without any exceptions and only a swivel-eyed racist would believe otherwise.
pro	We have been giving money to poor areas but via the EU after they take a massive cut. It is our money always has been. Fed up of hearing about EU funded projects. There is no such thing in this country. We are net contributors.
pro	We have been lied to endlessly by our very own political class about the economic benefits of remaining a part of the disastrous EU project.
pro	We have broke free from a dictatorship . Our Brexit vote might even bring the whole EU project down. It's not just about money. We are a great country .All the Remain voters are all arrogant big heads ,who talk down to people. I know people like you who i go to school with .These people never fight the system ,they think they are clever.But never clever enough to realise they are being controlled by the elite.
pro	We have contributed a great deal to Europe in many ways and yet this is what they think of us. Doesn't this suggest we were wrong to join such a club of corrupt politicians and states continuously taking from us?
pro	We have finally taken our country back from the EU after 47 years. I love Britain, Europe and the European people, but strongly oppose the neoliberal and toxic EU: it is a dictatorship. Now let‚Äôs put the ‚ÄòGreat‚Äô back into Britain!
pro	We have left. They are in no position to demand anything.
anti	We have lost our freedoms and we always were independent. You‚Äôve stolen the opportunities and rights of the young generation that you yourself were happy to throw away.
anti	We have lost our freedoms and we always were independent. You‚Äôve stolen the opportunities and rights of the young generation that you yourself were happy to throw away. Well done!
pro	We have many negotiating tools in our box, including our fishing waters, banking and security industries and of course consumer purchasing power.
anti	We have more influence in the EU than out of it. Stop Brexit now.
pro	We have never had any real influence in the EU....another political mirage foisted on the UK public
anti	We have one year to stop Brexit happening.
pro	We have paid in over 100 billion pounds over and above what we have got back. What is our supposed benefit for this one way traffic. Now we will have a vote at last.
pro	We have regulations and taxes and tariffs that are meant to benefit other EU countries and don‚Äôt benefit us.
pro	We have seen hundreds of thousands of people each year migrate from Eastern Europe to attach themselves to the UK welfare nipple.
anti	We have simply lost all influence in European decisions and made ourselves vulnerable to US bullying, which has started already. We will continue to comply with EU regulations but have no say whatsoever.
pro	We have to VOTE LEAVE for freedom and Democracy away from the Euro Project Dictatorship
anti	We have to keep eu togheter if we want to ever to be great again
anti	We have to stay in the eu
pro	We have tried enough. time to walk away. If anyone is looking clarity tell them no deal.
pro	We have won a peaceful revolution. We have defeated the europhile globalist, protectionist authoritarians and ensured the future of our country for generations to come is one of sovereign democracy. Thankyou fellow Brexiteers , Thankyou Farage, Thankyou Boris. It‚Äôs down to you, all heroes.
pro	We have won a peaceful revolution. We have defeated the europhile globalist, protectionist authoritarians both in the UK and in the global elite and ensured the future of our country for generations to come is one of sovereign democracy. Thankyou fellow Brexiteers , Thankyou Farage, Thankyou Boris. It‚Äôs down to you, all heroes.
pro	We have won the war. We have now entered the post-strife peace negotiations.
anti	We haven't left yet !!! I found your video Premature, Perhaps you should wait for the 2 years Negotiation period to be completed before bragging about Brexit , currently, not a single EU law has been replaced as result I m not surprised you believe Brexit fears have not materialized
pro	We hold the cards despite what the remainers keep telling you.
pro	We hope it works out for them. But if it does not, there will always be a seat kept for them at the table
pro	We import a similar amount to our exports to the US so if the US were to make good on this threat to its friend and partner it would damage both economies. Basically the US is saying that it will treat us badly if we seek to regain our independence. With friends like that who needs enemies? Personally I am happy to pay whatever it takes to regain independence.
anti	We import lots of our food from France, Spain and Italy.
anti	We import most of our cars from France, Germany and Italy.
anti	We import most of our oil and coal and much of our gas. How will we have enough electricity to run the freezer, or even the lights?
pro	We in UK have delivered our verdict on leaving the EU and we do not need to be asked again...
pro	We in the USA look forward to a great trade deal with you. Congratulations and #HappyBrexit
pro	We joined a common market and now left behind the EU which has morphed into something we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to be part of. Freedom starts from today; our own rules and we can trade internationally.
pro	We joined an economic union back in the 70s, and by the end of the 90s this union had become a political one, which a court and parliament that made ours no long supreme or sovereign. How people can want to preserve this baffles me- I'm willing to accept a few potential years of economic recession if it means self governance. 800 years ago we created the magna carta, and nearly 400 years ago we fought a civil war over the unelected creating laws for the people. The European union in its current state of federalism makes both of these events irrelevant.
pro	We joined it under the guise of it being a trading bloc and that's categorically not what it is now
pro	We joined the Common Market because in the 70s the UK was a basket case. Since then the economy shifted from industrial to financial. That makes us a net customer, whereas France and Germany are net producers. While in theory France could punish us with high export tariffs, it's unlikely that they will. Global trade has become much easier in the last thirty years, and the idea of a trade block, while perhaps appropriate in the 60s, is now rather old hat. As a customer able to shop elsewhere, we have an advantage.
pro	We just don't want to be part of this federation that has assumed more and more powers over time, without any votes or say so of the citizens.
pro	We just want to be citizens of our own countries - not EU citizens.
pro	We knew exactly what we were doing when we voted to leave, we understand the meaning of the verb ‚Äòto leave‚Äô, and what they are thinking of serving up is absolutely nothing like leaving‚Äù #brexit
pro	We knew exactly what we were voting for. We were asked if we wanted to leave the EU and we said yes.
pro	We leave in March, if we don't have a withdrawal agreement in place or a trade agreement so be it. That can be done outside of the EU.
pro	We leave in March. No problem
pro	We leave regardless because we have a destiny outside vanilla Europe. They stand in our way at their peril.
pro	We leaving about time the dirty scummy twats
pro	We left I'm so happy now just hurry up with the process
pro	We left the EU In control of our armed forces and intelligence services
pro	We left the EU because we want to control our own borders, laws, keep our nation sovereign. We've always been the pariahs of Europe and it's natural for us to forge our own individual destiny.
pro	We left yayyyyyy
anti	We left........ We‚Äôre going to collapse
pro	We liberated europe a long time ago and since then we have poured billions into their economy , its now time to liberate the UK .
pro	We like visiting Europe but we despise the EU. Anti-EU is NOT anti-Europe. Britain is a sovereign nation. THIS is a good day!
anti	We like you, Brits, but you make it difficult, considering the mess you put us all into... still, we like you. Think this thoroughly, please.
pro	We live in a period where buying British has gone , but now we are independent it gives us hope . Hope that British businesses will once again be successful and steadfast
anti	We live in a time to rip down borders and nationalism. We're humans and shouldn't be defined by the piece of land we live on
anti	We live in a time to rip down borders and nationalism. We're humans and shouldn't be defined by the piece of land we live on,. Very backward way of thinking.
pro	We look forward to doing business with a FREE and INDEPENDENT Britain
pro	We love the people of Europe, we just don't want to be ruled by their crooks. We already have enough of our own to deal with. And we will deal with them: our house - our rules.
pro	We made our decision to Leave.
pro	We make decisions for the best interests
pro	We make more medicines in the UK than the whole EU, including France.
anti	We may be strong economically, but so is Chipping Norton, and no one would suggest they could survive as an independent entity. We are tiny and the sooner we let go of this vision of Britain as the heart of Empire renamed Commonwealth the better.
anti	We must NEVER give up! Rejoiners unite! Let's be defiant and organise.
pro	We must have a deal that inflicts maximum damage to the EU.........Lets make them suffer!
pro	We must leave EU immediately, I don‚Äôt want refugees to flow into our country.
pro	We must leave the EU i don't want to deal with Article 13.
pro	We must leave the EU.
anti	We must not underestimate the power of the Daily Mail, the Express or the Sun. For decades, they have fuelled intense hatred of the EU among their uneducated readers. The announcement of a second referendum will be like a red rag to a bull to them - they will launch a ferocious campaign with roaring headlines such as ‚ÄôNOW the remoaners want to steal the people‚Äôs referendum‚Äô. The gullible readers, even those who are already suffering from inflation and job losses, will vote leave again.
anti	We must respond to Brexit with more than yelling
anti	We must stay in the EU. Employers benefit from free movement, and the ability to move capital and jobs around the trading block (offshoring is a brilliant way to increase competitiveness).
pro	We must win this referendum we must vote LEAVE! We will never get another chance
pro	We need Brexit to happen.
anti	We need MPs who do their job and distantiate themselves from the nonsense that the people really want Brexit. #Brexit is a crime. There is no mandate when you win 52% on lies, stolen private data, social media high-tech and big foreign money.
pro	We need a Prime Minister like President Trump who will take us out of the EU now!!
pro	We need a foreign central government to rule over us or else we will regress derp derp
pro	We need a general election to get the traitors out so that we can finally get the Brexit 17.4 million people voted for.
anti	We need a second referendum. The younger generation should get a vote on Brexit because it affects them just as much
pro	We need a strong leader who can fight Eurocorruption and cares about people and country, like Nancy Pelosi!
pro	We need democracy to preserve our freedoms, but we should focus a lot more on the essential freedoms, otherwise even with democratic votes, you might end in a dictatorship. Exhibit A is Germany in the 1930s
pro	We need people to be positive about Brexit, instead of the constant negativity and scaremongeri.
anti	We need people to come to the UK and live here for the economy to work by closing the UK off to the EU by not allowing free movement of labour this will mean more jobs in the UK? Wrong we need these people for their labour and it is wrong to assume they all are unskilled. Leaving the EU will be our biggest mistake and will cost the economy another recession and heavily impact the majority of UK citizens over the next ten years.
anti	We need the EU because our governments are often irresponsible.
anti	We need the EU otherwise we are a tiny little island on our own. Just start a new EU and ditch all the nuisance countries (France). The others will follow.
anti	We need the EU, especially for the future, without it we‚Äôre going to have a hard time as single nations in an ever more competitive world.
anti	We need to #StopBrexit.
pro	We need to LEAVE - just as stated in the referendum. WTO not this deceitful deal that Olly EU and May cooked up to keep us tied into the crumbling, discredited EU.
pro	We need to dump them NOW, whilst they're in panic mode, so we can destroy their evil empire before they destroy us and Europe!
anti	We need to end the Brexit madness
pro	We need to get off the sinking EU ship as soon as possible.
pro	We need to get out as soon as possible, their true colours are emerging?.
pro	We need to get the hated EU out of the UK now by whatever means necessary.
pro	We need to get the remainers to take pride in their country. Only if they take pride in their homes will they end up with homes to be proud of. Only if they believe in themselves will they have the chance to achieve great things.
pro	We need to hang in there and face the EU down.¬† No blinking until we leave and then lots of flag-waving!
pro	We need to know and understand what's coming next after Brexit¬†( with OR without a deal ) - this is what WILL happen.¬†The EU has recognised that our country is a threat to their Superstate¬†project once again.¬†It seems that in every century their efforts to unify and rule the whole of Europe¬†is dashed by the interfering actions of the British¬†- Napoleon (19th Century), Hitler ( 20th Century ) EU Commission ( 21st Century). They will now need to crush us entirely because leaving us alone, to thrive, to prosper, to grow in power and influence, to become an economic competitor right on their doorstep simply cannot be allowed. Remember - Brexit is not just about Britain taking back control, it's also about the EU LOSING control.
pro	We need to leave ASAP, I as many others did not vote to be controlled by Brussels. The ridiculous amount of money given to the EU every day will help our country recover especially the NHS. Now the EU is allowing the Calais migrants to use their human¬†rights to have their cases heard here so they will all head our way the same as when they drop going to the first country. Genuine Refugees fleeing horrific war zones are in genuine need of help but economic migrants are not. We need to take action and fast track our British Bill of Rights now instead of the summer. The small print though still will allow migrants to exercise their human rights. This should not be allowed in the uk once the British bill is in place. We need leaders to be strong with an iron will and lead us out of the EU I will then once more be proud to be British and no longer afraid for our future.
pro	We need to leave before the Euro collapses and possibly the EU with it.
pro	We need to leave but they wont let us !
pro	We need to leave now and govern ourselves. This is the way that we have succeeded so well in the past
pro	We need to leave on WTO terms. just out of general principal.. the EU need to learn their lesson.
anti	We need to make sure that all Brits go home after Brexit. Good bye EHIC, good bye sunshine. Hello social assitance crash.
anti	We need to pull together not just for a Peoples Vote but to stop Brexit completely and then work so that this does not happen again. The UK badly needs healing.
pro	We need to regain control of our laws and borders.
pro	We need to rule our own country! We need to create a more stable immigration system and we need to put British tax payers money into Britain not the EU where it is used to bail out every other country but our own!
pro	We need to slash foreign aid, the amount of money we send overseas is an absolute joke.
pro	We need to walk away with no deal
pro	We need to walk.
anti	We need to work together. Not split up. The brexit was a horrible idea
anti	We need to work together. Not split up. The brexit was a horrible idea.
anti	We need unskilled labours. Our workforce is skilled enough as it is. Besides that if we leave 100,000s of our own citizens will have to return to our country many of which can't work. They are elderly and will put further strain on our health care.(which is one of the largest employers of migrants because UK citizens don't want to be nurses) So the NHS may crumble if we choose to leave the EU.
pro	We never lost Europe we are leaving the EU i thank Cameron at least he did give the people a voice The EU has hyjacked the word EUROPE thank god we voted Leave
pro	We never lost Europe we got rid of Europe lol it all went right you've talked to politicians all right remainers where's the leavers and Cameron was a snob who didn't think working class would get rid of eu well thank god we did and him as well why did he roll his sleeves up at rallies he's never done a hard day's work in his life
pro	We never voted for UNION in the first place...thats why this is an anti-climax...we voted to be in a common trading market...NOTHING MORE
pro	We never voted for a deal,democracy must prevail. If not We will be finished as a sovereign nation.
pro	We never voted to be ruled by a third party.
pro	We never were the resistance. The People voted and only remainers wanted to resist. It‚Äôs time to stop arguing and get on with it. Peace
pro	We not need a Brexit we need a Euexit (The EU must go) !
pro	We now have a country where we can vote out the people who are acting on our behalf in matters politic. Don‚Äôt like the direction of travel? You can use your vote. The people under EU rule don‚Äôt have that option. They are subject to the whims of appointed managers with a diaphanous veneer of democracy. None of us are involved in the negotitions, nor know how the result will play out. The one thing that is true is that the UK is now more democratic and whichever party forms the government they are no longer constrained by EU dictatorship.
anti	We now know Brexit was rigged by Cambridge Analytica and the Russians.
pro	We only ever voted to join the common market anyway, not what is now the EU. No wonder we want out.
pro	We ordinary souls that do not have huge wealth to shelter us and our children want Brexit.
pro	We owe Europe under ten million pounds, THEY owe us BILLIONS for the cost of Liberating them during WW2.
anti	We owe the money... if we don't pay it our international reputation and creditworthiness goes down the tube...
pro	We owe them NOTHING!!!
pro	We owe them nothing but there will be plenty on here no doubt saying we do. How anyone can agree to giving away 39bn of hard earned taxpayers money when you look all around and see how much we need that money ourselves is beyond me. I don't even think we should pay it if we get a deal. Who in their right mind pays someone just so they can sell us their stuff? Because our exports are more outside the EU than in it. But no doubt we will because our politicians are so weak, it won't effect them but get ready for another 10yrs of austerity to pay for it
anti	We pay a lot of money to the EU in fees. For that we get right of access to western Europe and right to travel, work and live where we choose. Europe is 'Our Country' and is at peace. We get the single market and the customs union which means free trade in many countries all around the world. Its great value. We will lose all this at the end of transition and cannot replace the lost trade. Shame.
pro	We ran the country well enough before BLAIR signed our country over to the EU the people didnt sign it over . Therefore we do not belong to it which means they have no hold over us. So we would like to leave piecefully & be left to bring our country back up to being GREAT BRITAIN again . We would like all the intruders to go back to there own countrys & fight for it not leave it to others to fight for it for them...
pro	We really don't care any more, just get us out of this monstrosity now
pro	We really must put most of our efforts into negotiating trade deals with the rest of the World. The bureaucratic EU will drone on and on, for month after month, with little or no progress being made.
pro	We really should just leave. Mrs May, get a backbone and tell the EU what to do!
anti	We remainers must now aim for Britain to do well ‚Äì and the EU even better
pro	We right behind you Boris. power to the people . @JamesLarkhill @BorisJohnson you are the Man
pro	We rule Britannia again! üá¨üáß
pro	We see young people wandering on streets with no jobs. Skill them and employ them. Do not make excuses to remain in the EU
anti	We shall be no more independent, less global, and with a very uncertain future.
anti	We should be fixing our problems instead of leaving the EU.
anti	We should be shouting to stop Brexit
pro	We should celebrate our escape from this badly thought out EU project. It was not what we signed up for all those years ago. I for one will end my dry January with drink or 2.
pro	We should celebrate our new freedom
anti	We should do what they say. We are going to need to stay on good terms so when the Brexit disaster fails like we said it would we can march Farage to the EU parliament to get down on his hands and knees and beg Juncker to let us back in and admit he was wrong and we might have a chance of being accepted back in.
pro	We should do what trump said. Sue the EU . The macron led agenda against the UK is also against EU rules. Sooner we leave the better. That is why nearly all leave voters just want out now.
pro	We should have never joined the EEC/EU in the first place (in my view).
anti	We should have only allowed people who can tie their own shoelaces to vote. If we had that there‚Äôd be no Brexit!
anti	We should have to prepare for the referendum for not to leave EU
pro	We should insist that the EU follow our rules
pro	We should just leave then start to make deals
pro	We should leave the EU and form a new trading block with the nations of the commonwealth. I'm not afraid of leaving the EU in the slightest. If they need us they can come knocking cap in hand. That's the way it will be not the other way round.
pro	We should leave the EU. I just hope that when we do, this government does get stricter on immigration and has an Aussie style points system. But knowing the tories they won't because their big business chums, LOVE immigration. If we leave the EU, France and Finland should follow suit.
pro	We should leave. The EU is worthless as is. Governs with back to its citizens, and not because it‚Äôs leading them. EU has other interests in mind which are not those of it‚Äôs citizens or Europe.
pro	We should listen to the very people that never listened to us, well sorry but our day has come and you can do what you made us do over the decades, sit back and take it.
pro	We should not negotiate with the EU until after we leave. There is no point.
anti	We should of stayed in the EU.
anti	We should remain with the EU, however some adjustments could and should be made especially to benefits and housing of immigrants.
pro	We should stop buying German/French cars and buy Japanese or Korean ones and exchange French wines for GB/US/Australian/ Sth. American wines. The UK is a MASSIVE market and they need our pounds. Time for Made In UK stickers on all products to give consumers more information on the choices they make in the supermarket. I for one would pay a little bit extra just to stick two fingers up at the EU.
pro	We shouldn't have become so dependent on EU systems IN THE FIRST PLACE ! Time to develop our own system and infrastructure with some of the 39 Billion saved if no deal !!
pro	We simply must leave on WTO terms...Europe is in a federalistic mess.
anti	We start the campaign to remain now. More people now want in than out
pro	We still have every chance of winning this. Vote leave!
pro	We support Brexit but that does not make us bad guys
pro	We support Brexit here in the US. ¬†Many of us here in the US have English roots. ¬†It's your sovereign nation and you should have a say in who you let in.
pro	We survived before we went into the Common Market...we will survive after we leave the EU...all we need is the chance.
pro	We the British people are very happy to be leaving the parasitic, EU(SSR) dictatorship,
pro	We the people don‚Äôt want it saving we want full Eu membership cancelled as that‚Äôs what we voted for via David Cameron‚Äôs big Eu vote speech !! GET ON WITH IT
anti	We think the best thing that could happen would be a revote on the Brexit... It's weakening the English economy.
pro	We thrived for thousands of years and became a world power because the EU wasn't around to lead us by the nose.
pro	We tried to get better agreements and more freedom before however we got given nothing.
pro	We understand Brexit means some pain. But it will be less painfull than the failure of the EU project when it goes down the pan ...which it will ......is! We just won't be there picking up the bill ....Germany will.
pro	We voted LEAVE. We wait to see whether the government will betray us or honour the democratic vote and get us out of the EU entirely
pro	We voted Leave. We can't just say we fancy staying now ‚Äì it's not that simple.
pro	We voted OUT to get rid of those parasites,
pro	We voted Out not for some dodgy deal that ties us to that decrepit, totalitarian state
pro	We voted brexit so you need to accept that and get behind the country. Anybody would think remainers would want the country to fail the way they have acted sine we voted to leave.
pro	We voted brexit, and haven‚Äôt got it. This country is supposed to be a democracy. clearly NOT.
pro	We voted for Brexit so let us the British people shout,
pro	We voted for Brexit. It must be delivered.
pro	We voted for a nation state model of government - not to be part of an ever expanding continental dictatorship
pro	We voted for democracy - which is disappearing fast all over Europe!
anti	We voted for sanction to be put onto us, that is what brexit is.
pro	We voted leave and we won, that‚Äôs democracy.
pro	We voted leave because the politicians of the EU we're meant to represent us & instead they dictate us. No deal will is our better option than remaining with those who demand things. Someone who demands things from others is not an ally
pro	We voted leave so get on with it
pro	We voted not to go in. The French said no several times. Glad that we are out. We will have more money to spend 0n our Cointry and its people. Well done.
pro	We voted out it‚Äôs out end of go UKIP
pro	We voted out let‚Äôs wave üëã goodbye now eu no deal and we keep our 39 billion pounds
pro	We voted out, its a simple equation.
pro	We voted please accept it we are out.
pro	We voted to LEAVE because we wanted to LEAVE
pro	We voted to LEAVE. The only way we can respect that decision to LEAVE is by going WTO but remoaner MPs are doing everything possible to destroy democracy and Brexit and want to stop us ever having a sensible deal [which is NOT treason May's deal written by her EU masters] and leave or go WTO. The only thing that will please this lot will be ''remain''. They want to destroy democracy for good in our country.
pro	We voted to Leave, not for a deal.
pro	We voted to Leave. No Customs Union. No adherence to EU laws. Control of our own borders. This is No Deal Brexit.
pro	We voted to leave e.u with no deal despite the economy downturn. You say to a brit who has nothing you will lose out he will vote leave.
pro	We voted to leave no deal is better than this deal
anti	We voted to leave the EU based on a tissue of lies promulgated by the serial liar and serial incompetent Johnson.The reason for his lying had nothing to do with the EU and everything to do with his ambition to become PM. Well the got his wish and now is payback time because he is entirely clueless as to what to do next. The country has been destroyed purely because of his personal ambition.
pro	We voted to leave the EU, nobody voted for a deal.
pro	We voted to leave without a deal.
pro	We voted to leave, not a deal, let's leave and focus on this nations strengths
pro	We voted to leave, now respect that!
pro	We voted to leave. We must leave. No customs union. No single market. No staying in this undemocratic corrupt disgrace. Leave with no deal. Pay nothing. Take our chances.
pro	We voted voted to leave! ..Now just do it!...
pro	We want Out!
pro	We want a NO deal Brexit. If Brexit is scrapped there will be the biggest protest Britain has ever seen.
pro	We want a clean, brutal, no ties, no deal break!!!! Listen dipshit, there is NO benefit to the UK being the EU.
pro	We want freedom from the EU!
anti	We want more time with EU
pro	We want no deal, I'm sure Britain will become Great Britain again , withought your greed and reform. NO DEAL, thank you and good bye.
anti	We want our pubs back!! Bring the taxes down, who sets the taxes I bet it's them European
pro	We want our pubs back!! Bring the taxes down, who sets the taxes I bet it's them European we want beer will can afford!! We want our pubs back!!!!
pro	We want out
pro	We want out of the EU cause we want our military back
pro	We want out. I and everyone I know id happy to leave under no deal. Lets just get it done. Stop screwing around. We survived the Germans twice we can do it again.
pro	We want to govern ourselves - it's simple!
pro	We want to leave because we are sick of paying for poor unstable countries and paying more than we get back to the EU and giving immigrants the red carpet when some of of soldiers are struggling to get by and we want our country back and I'm very angry with how they are trying to blackmail us by making us pay 50 billion to leave how about you ask those parasites you let swarm into your country pay that fee.
pro	We want to make our own laws, control our own borders, choose our own trading partners
pro	We want what we voted for. Out of the EU. Nothing else you can deal with us if you want but on our terms. Simple.
anti	We wanted the UK to stay in
anti	"We were Global Britain. Then @conservatives turned into UKIP. Now we're a Global Laughing Stock. From our friends in the US: ""The problem with holding out for a perfect Brexit plan is that you can‚Äôt fix stupid."" #BrexitShambles"
anti	We were all talking about it in school and we all wanted to remain... But we can't vote so you cares... I do , it's my future
pro	We were asked to vote, we voted LEAVE, thats it. The only remaining question is whether the government will honour the vote or betray the people.
pro	We were fed up by being ruled by the EU now where out at last no more paying u lot our uk money. ü§£üëçüëçüëç
anti	"We were often described in past times as the ""Sick Man of Europe"". Well, we‚Äôre going to be even sicker if commonsense does not prevail."
anti	We were told the Iraq War was a bold risk worth taking. It was a lie.
pro	We will also be able to say that all our laws are made in our Parliament, by directly elected representatives, rather than having to incorporate laws made overseas in Brussels.
pro	We will be 38 Billion pounds better off for a start. We are taking our Country backüëç
pro	We will be able to take proper control of our boarders to keep out health and economic migrants, along with the bogus refugees.
anti	We will be back inside 20 years. Too late for an old man like me, but our young people will one day enjoy the benefits of being an EU citizen again.
pro	We will be great again that‚Äôs why we are called GREAT BRITAIN
anti	We will be important fruit and veg from Israel and other countries increasing the miles they travel and damaging many smaller farms in Europe
anti	We will be weaker. We will be poorer.
pro	We will decide ourselves no longer will we have to tow the line!

anti	We will have to take whatever deal the EU is prepared to give us.
anti	We will leave against the will of the people
pro	We will leave the EU get used to it; Brexit Forever
pro	We will never again willingly be mastered by another FOREIGN POWER, we will never again be forcefully subjected to any foreign designed laws, we will never again agree to open borders to unwanted hordes of hostile immigrants and refugee's
anti	We will never get behind brexit because we know who is behind Brexit, and we want nothing to do with it.
pro	We will now have true democracy once again
pro	We will now have true democracy once again.
pro	We will now have true democracy once again. We will be able to take proper control of our boarders to keep out health and economic migrants, along with the bogus refugees.
pro	We will now have true democracy once again. We will be able to take proper control of our boarders to keep out health and economic migrants, along with the bogus refugees. We will also be able to negotiate trade deals with the rest of the free world, without the stranglehold dictats of the EU beurocrats. Because the changes will be gradual, most people won't notice much difference for quite a while. But once the country finds it's new freedoms, I think we will see things change for the better.
pro	We will prosper because we can select who comes here now and not be dictated to by the EU we have to take these unwanted that are swamping Europe and we all know what type of these 'unwanted' are.
anti	We will regret leaving
anti	We will rejoin and it will be great!
pro	We will so better off no more EU taking our money no more forcing us to take their Muslims refugees.
anti	We will then celebrate entering into a transition phase where we have to abide by EU law without any say and presently not having any trade agreements with even one of the 10 largest economies in the world. Laughing stock
pro	We won Mr. Stark.
pro	We won the battle of Britain without USA we turned Hitler away. he cancelled the take over of Britain we did that one little fxxxxxg island we don't need USA we don't need eu but they seem by all accounts to need us
pro	We won the vote to leave fair an square.
anti	We won‚Äôt be able to export them and over 40% of our exports go to the EU. We do rather need them to buy!
anti	We would likely be at a considerable diplomatic disadvantage because the EU would inevitably look after its own interests and any terms offered would benefit the EU first.
pro	We'll all be better off for it
anti	We'll be the 51st state of the United States when Boris Johnson will shift job from Prime Minister to Governor or the British Isles, 85% of land designated for Trump's new golf developments, 5% for concentration camps, and thos lucky enough to be all camped up in Jaywick waving little union jack flags to the melifluous sounds of Farage
anti	We'll end rejoining in 10-15 year's time and your legacy will subside into dust and you will become an irrelevance...enjoy the limelight whilst you still have it.
pro	We'll get around to teaching remoaners how to get their heads out of their arses.
pro	We'll have our cake and eat it , the eu dictatorship is now irrelevant
pro	We're FREEEEEEEEEES AND OUT YIPPPIII
anti	We're Out! We're out of our minds!
pro	We're all Brexiters now. I hope the Remoaners get on board with reality and play a constructive role. Stop living in fantasy world where there will be no Brexit. The people have spoken and we need to get on board and make Brexit a success.
anti	We're all gonna die. Woohoo
anti	We're all so fucked it's not even vaguely amusing.
anti	We're better together. We're kinder together. We work better together. We love and live together. Let's #VoteRemain
anti	We're finished as a country unless we ignore the referendum result, that's the reality. I don't really care whether that defies democracy, the fact it we're better off in. Our elected MPs must act to keep us in. However if we actually do leave then I and many others will leave this country for good
anti	We're heading into a new dark age and it may be way longer this time.
pro	We're leaving a political union not the blinking continent!! We are still European just not members of a bloated unelected self serving political union‚Ä¶
pro	We're leaving, even if we have to bring back the noose for traitors. Wimp.
anti	We're letting xenophobic fear-mongering morons ruin not only our futures, but the futures of so many innocent people who relied on us.
pro	We're not isolated from the world. The world knocks on our door.
pro	We're not leaving Europe, we are leaving the European Union
pro	We're not out yet until the Prime Minister invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, why pay 20 billion pounds a year and get less then 10 billion back, the country is being dragged down in the gutter. Thank you for your coverage, hope we do a trade deal with the USA our true partners. Socialism is the new word for slavery.
anti	We're not self sufficient enough that's why. We import alot of food from abroad. Import alot of manufactured goods.
pro	We're not the first to vote to leave or last, Greenland left back in the early 80s
pro	We're out!!!! We did it!!! üá¨üáßüá¨üáßüá¨üáß
pro	We're out, and we're staying out. ;)
pro	We're taking back control!
pro	We've been browbeaten by the Eurofanatics for 40 years but now they are getting a taste of their own medicine they don't like it.
pro	We've done it, lads. We've escaped this lunacy. #GotBrexitDone
anti	We've got Irish (North & South) ancestry & my Sister was hoping we could apply for Irish citizenship (I doubt it), if the shambolic mess goes through.
pro	We've got free trade deals with most of the world though? The UK has one of the freest economies in the world and that's down to government policy, not the EU.
anti	"We've had a year of ""will of the people"" ""accept the result"" ""Get over it"" ""the people have spoken"" - yes we have and we say no to Brexit"
pro	We've had one and we don't need another, get us out, it's simple but we have the wrong people in charge and the choice is poor.
pro	We've voted and sposed to be leaving...are we, we still have to fight for freedom
anti	We, the British people, have shot ourselves in the foot
anti	We, the British people, have shot ourselves in the foot.
pro	Welcome back to the club of free nations Britain. We missed you.
anti	Welcome to BoZo's Brexit Britain.
anti	Welcome to Brexit Britain. And it's about to get a whole lot worse. Shame on anyone who voted for this.
anti	Welcome to Brexit Britain... You did not liked the beaurocratic EU you can enjoy corrupt UK politicians, without scrutiny
anti	Welcome to England, (Scotland and co. soon to go) the land of clever little tax free zones, rampant poverty, not very much to sell and not very much money to buy.
anti	Welcome to the New Era of following EU rules without having any say in making them
pro	Welcome to the UK from Europe and good bye to EU membership
anti	Welcome to the United States of Great Britain. Enjoy your watered down employee protection laws, lower standards of food safety and, of course, a completely privatised health care system (or, at the very least, a health care system that has been portioned off to for-profit private companies with minimal oversight - much like those efficient privatised rail franchises). Greatest own-goal in modern history. Have fun with that.
anti	Welcome to the dehumanisation of Britain
pro	Welcome to the independence club EU is a globalist organization that seeks to destroy every ounce of national sovereignty and freedom it sees. It's downfall should be swift
anti	Welcome to the stone age! Woohoo!
anti	Well Boris this is another fine mess you've got us into. Pleased with yourself?
anti	Well Brexiters keep harping back to WWII. They will enjoy the rationing of food etc. Gives them the Dunkirk spirit.
anti	Well Done Boris Johnson.üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò§ü§¨ UK will suffer and regret this! Edit: Guys it‚Äôs my opinionüôÑüò≤üò≤üò≤
pro	Well Done Prime Minister Mr Boris Johnson, Nigel Fararge, The Brexitees, And The Unity Of The British People. A Victory For Real Democracy.
pro	Well Done now The British flag can be flown and be proud of a great country
anti	Well I hope all the brexiters will be happy, esp the old, i hope they like the cold and hunger.
anti	Well I think it's a terrible idea, but...bring it on. I will take my skills abroad, live amongst a less insular culture for a while. When the impoverished UK is desperate for people to come back within 5-10 years, house prices would hopefully have come crashing down somewhere to near a level I can afford. If, not, I'll stay away. Win-win either way for me.
pro	Well I'm not Russian and I'm a real person of this country! I would be happy to leave with no deal and take the risk.
anti	Well I'm not from the UK, so my opinion doesn't matter. Personally, I think they would have been better off in the EU, but they voted to leave, so that's their decision.
anti	Well IMO (I'm not British) , It's dumb to let 51% decide decades of country future, that's first of all. At least 3/4 of the country should agree with these kind of decisions. For seconds, mostly older generation voted to leave and younger wants to stay.. So it is not that elders are right or wrong, but in saying how the future is shaped I think the ones who should have more voice are the people who will be in that future let's say ~5-15 years from referendum. And a lot of campaign let's get out was - we will get all the benefits and 0 consequences, mayyybe slight discomfort, but nah, EU will fall before our feet.. And that was complete BS. But the people who know no better still believed that. So the second referendum is the way to go IMO - with all the facts everyone has now, the truth about negotiations, and what may or may not happen after Brexit is more clear, the people should have the last say - is that what they wanted, or the campaign leave was such a BS that it's better to stay than go through?
anti	Well Johnson won‚Äôt be broke at the end of this, but I‚Äôm not so confident for the rest of us.
anti	Well UK is setting up barriers to trade with the world. So basically its like gravity, you minimize trade you earn less money
anti	Well a majority of the People now wish to #Remain in the EU...but in Parl ideologues & party hacks are denying the option to test it, being more interested in imposing their will on the Ppl than the true maj Will of the Ppl.
anti	Well anywhere Britain wants to go dealing EU is there already so !
anti	Well at least we won't have to worry about straight bananas any more - we probably won't be able to buy bananas after December!
pro	Well done @BorisJohnson , will go down in history as one of the greatest PM's üëçüëèüçª
pro	Well done Boris the sense of freedom is overwhelming I cannot wait for the future and the prosperity that will Come. Brexit got done
pro	Well done Boris you delivered this far, now show your EU counterparts that you mean business. If they do not wish to negotiate in good faith, tell them to do one, and go no deal!
pro	Well done Boris!
pro	Well done Boris, The People's Prime Minister
pro	Well done Boris, it's the first time I voted Conservative and it won't be the last. Keep the faith!
pro	Well done Boris.
pro	Well done Brexitparty. Without you we would be stuffed.
anti	Well done Brexiturds yet another triumph for stupidity
pro	Well done Britain !!!!!¬† great outcome for a great future !!!!!!¬†¬† Now we need just to wait for Trump's victory in Nov
pro	Well done Britain we will prosper Good to see the commonwealth coming back together too. God save our queen
pro	Well done Britain we will prosper Good to see the commonwealth coming back together too. God save our queen üòçüòò
pro	Well done Britain we will prosper. Good to see the commonwealth coming back together too. God save our queen
pro	Well done Britain! It's a great day for democracy!Hope we leave next, Greetings from Ireland
pro	Well done England! YOU ARE FREE !!! Congratulations !!! Now my Poland must leave the German union! Long live free England! Long live Poland!
pro	Well done I like him. No messing Boris we want a clean break not any more extensions or being tied to the EU. You need to keep your promises if you want to be elected next time üíï
pro	Well done Leavers, we got our country back, now it‚Äôs up to us
pro	Well done Nigel Farage, the man that started this whole movement to escape the failing EU, thank you.
pro	Well done SIR NIGEL FARAGE. So happy to see the traitors and snowflakes sob and cry their eyes out. I hope they weep for 3.5 years + interest.
pro	Well done UK 1st is nationalism & safety.....economic development is just a 2nd thing..... Protect your country & Culture.....
pro	Well done UK finally free of the EUSSR!
pro	Well done UK free of EUSSR
pro	Well done UK! Love from Australia. May this be the reemergence of a new Commonwealth. UK, Australia, New Zealand and India
anti	Well done UK, you have made the EU weaker, but only the EU but also yourselves and in doing so you have made Russia, China, and the US stronger.
pro	Well done UK. You still have the bulldog spirit, sense of fair play and love of freedom. As an Irishman I admire you all.
anti	Well done to Sweden..remain is the only way forward
pro	Well even though as a Greek I know there was some British people who we're teasing Greece's economic situation and such as well as everyone else which totally wrong and disgustingly racist in all views but. I support Britain.
pro	Well he's right I do support #Brexit
anti	Well hey, on the bright side at least this shows that the US isn't the only country inhabited by far too many people with so much space between the ears they probably suffer weather patterns.
anti	Well in fairness. I hope our political/economic turmoil acts as a lesson to the rest of the Europe. A lesson in what not to do.
anti	Well it's an impressive act of shooting oneself into the own foot on an epic scale.
pro	Well it's finally about time. The people of U.K. have been waiting for this for a long long time
pro	Well it's finally about time. The people of U.K. have been waiting for this for a long long time.
anti	Well my future is now officially fucked. Good job voters, not thinking about our generation. Good job.
pro	Well obviously German citizens don't consider the UK a part of Europe for a while now. When traveling last year I had a smartass Passport control agent laugh at me when I referred to England as Europe. So good riddance to the EU and more power to you, get on with it. You will enhance your strengths, and conttol your own destiny.
anti	Well of course he is. #Brexiters are so high on their #Brexit cr*p they'd cheer a deranged clown if it insulted #EU... Oh look - they just did. When will they actually get back to looking after their voters (most of whom DO NOT NOW WANT BREXIT)???
pro	Well over 2 years of prevaricating and now they want to delay. Being booted out of office is not enough. There needs to be some sort of retribution, starting with imprisonment
pro	Well said. All of Britain should realize their freedom is at stake. The mask is off of the beast. Tell the EU no. Tell them to go to hell. Live free or die!!!!!!!!!!!!
anti	Well since we 'have all the cards' as the brexiters kept telling us, I expect the EU to fold completely in the face or our overwhelming advantages and give us everything we want........right?
anti	Well technically all old (65+) people voted leave which is so stupid they get to vote because they wont feel the consequences as much us younger people ALSO northern Ireland and Scotland voted to stay but England voted to leave so If Brexit does happen Scotland and northern Ireland will make a vote to leave GB and Join E
anti	Well that idiot will bring the UK to the brink that much is sure
anti	Well that was a nice simple process
anti	Well the UK dug this grave, so now they have to get nice and comfy in it
anti	Well the average British citizen already fucked themselves over when they voted in favor of Brexit. Reap as ye shall sow, fuckwits.
anti	Well the brits are fckd
anti	Well the deal is shady but leaving EU seems like a fool's errand!
anti	Well the fucknuts have won. Enjoy the shit storm that follows.
pro	Well then tell the EU to take a Run and Jump and Let's have a no Deal.
pro	Well there‚Äôs a surprise, Lammas stoking up the fires with nothing but lies. Simply twisting the facts to suit his narrative. No mention of Boris saying most will be better than the EU‚Äôs. Why would we still take rules from the EU now we‚Äôve left? You‚Äôre ridiculous.
pro	Well this is a surprise. I thought itv were better than this. Brexit is about improving life
anti	Well this might go badly,or perhaps extremely badly.
anti	Well those who voted for this shitstorm can fuck off to the back of the food queues.
anti	Well to say that‚Äôs inconvenient seems like an understatement
anti	Well welcome to the start of everyone becoming poor
pro	Well you did it! Big Boris you absolute legend.
anti	Well, Brexit is turning out great. üòÇ
anti	Well, Brexit was never about supporting and helping UK citizens anyway.
anti	Well, I can only agree with you Simon.Well, I can only agree with you. But maybe the better idea would have been to fight Brexit when it was still possible?
pro	Well, I think it's safe to say that Europe is slowly dying.
pro	Well, Switzerland have been doing quite well without the EU!
anti	Well, a lot of people have now become a lot better informed and they realise Brexit is going to be extremely painful, both economically and socially, and they want it stopped!
anti	Well, for a start, I would guess that having a divided country is not a good opportunity to change the current system...
pro	Well, here we are. Time to move on as a country and look at other issues
anti	Well, hold on. It hasn't gone through yet, and won't for several years, and there's many a slip between cup and lip. Boris might get run over by a bus!!!!
pro	Well, if europe and the euro are so fucking amazing you don't need to worry about anything now do you?! Kid
anti	Well, it is crystal clear Brexit is impossible to execute, let's cancel the whole thing and get back to our lives.
anti	Well, it's time to vote on the #EUref now remember the immortal words of Londo Mollari and DON'T GIVE AWAY THE HOMEWORLD #VoteRemain
anti	Well, just leave then! Who needs your arrogant, backwards-minded, soon-to-be-broke asses anyway? But don't expect any special treatment, once you're out!
anti	Well, me and my partner who is English have moved to Germany now, so do what you want. We don't have to wait months to see a doctor for 5 minutes and aren't under threat from heroin addicts in the street anymore, despite open borders and 1 million refugees.
pro	Well, personally, I am delighted that I can have a possibility of handing a sovereign state over to my children as is their birthright
pro	Well, well, well......?????? Hahahahaha - what will the remoaners say now!!!?????
anti	Well... I am from Croatia and this brings tears to my eyes... Very sad day
pro	Well........ May might not get what she wants! But carry on and us leavers will get the WTO deal that WE want!!
anti	Well: ten months later, and Brexit has turned into a bumbling mess. Here's hoping Britain will be able to hold another referendum and stop the incoming hard exit on March 28th.
anti	Welp you guys finally did it. It took you four long years, but you did it. Now take off your pants and bend over, cause you're about to get economically *fucked*
anti	Welsh farmers are now bleating about losing EU farming subsidies and there will be tariffs on their lamb etc.Yet these very same farmers voted to leave the EU. They will soon regret that choice.Much more worrying is the loss of most of our car manufacturing-Airbus,chunks of finance,big sections of Pharmaceutical

pro	Were British once again...not Europeans...at last
anti	We‚Äôll need a VISA to go to Europe. Driving licenses won‚Äôt be valid. End of the roaming charges for using our phone‚Äôs abroad. All of this means that Brexit is impacting on the lives of people. it‚Äôs just becoming on huge, gigantic mess.
pro	We‚Äôll never rejoin after all the benefits of Brexit are realised, the EU is hanging on by its fingernails anyway and difficult to see it surviving for many more years - it needs total reform but the people with the power to allow that are unelected and too deeply ingrained in the corruption!
anti	We‚Äôll see what a sort of ‚Äú Fantastic , Robust Economy ‚Äú UK hides in his pocket !
anti	We‚Äôre alienating all of our closest trading partners, which is an extremely poor economic decision. The creation of a hard border in Northern Ireland could cause a resurgence of violence, but at the same time internal borders within the country are a bad idea as it would likely lead to the break up of the union, and if you have noticed how much of a shitshow Brexit has been for our economy so far imagine what Scotland leaving the UK would be like. Not to mention how shit this will be for businesses in Gibraltar. Free trade is a beneficial thing for everyone economically. I might decide I want to live and work abroad later in life, brexit would make this difficult. Skilled workers from the EU are very helpful to the economy and the NHS. The UK can no longer be a base for companies wishing to access European markets easily, which could cause them to relocate causing unemployment. The EU has an incentive to make this a disastrous decision for the UK to set an example to other member states considering leaving. In order to keep business we may have to ditch the higher European standards and accept lower standards of products from places like the USA, which could be bad for the health and quality of life of the general population as well as the environment. Also the Trump has said that the NHS would be on the table for a trade deal, which if agreed to by our politicians, who aren‚Äôt very well trusted at the moment could lead to the devaluation of healthcare as a basic human right. But hey at least we get blue passports.
anti	We‚Äôre fucked here in the UK.
pro	We‚Äôre leaving!!! Yes!!!! Bottle of champagne on 31/01
pro	We‚Äôre no longer leavers or remainers, we‚Äôre now optimists or pessimists
pro	We‚Äôre not going to be aligning with eussr rules, that‚Äôs not on the negotiating table, it‚Äôs not even an issue of red lines ‚Äì it is not even in the negotiating room, that‚Äôs Britain !
pro	We‚Äôre out !!!! We‚Äôre out !!!!! Time for the UK to sail onto a bright future .
pro	We‚Äôre still European. We‚Äôre just no longer subjects of the EU monster.
anti	We‚Äôre still not happy about Brexit but at least one good thing is that the NHS will be receiving ¬£350 million a week from now on
anti	We‚Äôre stronger together though
pro	We‚Äôve been here before with various German leaders threatening our Country . Ms Merkel thinks ‚ÄòBritain will need to look into the abyss before a deal is done at five to midnight‚Äô. Love her, hate her, or hate her some more, I despise this woman. These comments come from a Chancellor who single handedly, without so much as a care for any of the peoples, or Governments, of Europe, gave the green light back in 2015 for millions, yes, millions of migrants to swarm across Europe, unchecked, uncontrolled and unwanted, a situation which continues to this very day.
pro	We‚Äôve escaped the asylum, I can‚Äôt tell you how good it feels. Straight jackets off, face masks off, we can breathe again
anti	We‚Äôve had years of freedom of movement to do just that, but Brexit will change those opportunities.
pro	We‚Äôve lived with it both ways [inside and outside the EU] and I think a lot of people were fed up with these regulations and being ruled by people we didn‚Äôt know
pro	We‚Äôve lived with it both ways [inside and outside the EU] and I think a lot of people were fed up with these regulations and being ruled by people we didn‚Äôt know. People wanted to take back control.

anti	What Brexit? Englexit! Scotland and Wales will stay in the EU and the UK will implode ... Good luck !
anti	"What I find especially amazing is how many in the UK don't seem to¬†care, or don't think it'll matter. There seems to be this widespread notion that ""it'll all be ok in the end"". As if the adults are going to come back into the room and sort things out. As if the rest of the world will set up some kind of safety net to bail the country out from the consequences of its own actions.

anti	What I still to this day don't understand is how Europe is and became the enemy. It just does not make sense.
pro	What I voted for 43 years ago and 2.5 years ago to GET OUT!!
pro	What I would like to know is where is the Billions if not Trillions of pounds going to come from if we stay in the EU, we will need lots more Hospitals, Schools, and houses to cope with the millions of immigrants that are hell bent on coming to Britain plus the money for Doctors , Nurses and Teachers and billions of pounds per week for there Benefits, it is a lose, lose situation for the British People so VOTE TO LEAVE>

pro	What a beautiful day, perhaps only topped by Nov 8th!
pro	What a beautiful moment. Congrats to all the Brits who never gave up.
anti	What a bloody mess! All fueled by xenophobic, paranoid imbeciles like Mogg, Trump and Farage.
anti	What a bloody stupid idea Brexit is!
pro	What a breath of fresh air to have a leader with some backbone unlike the weak and feeble Theresa May who grovelled and capitulated at every turn, while looking like a scared rabbit in the headlights.
pro	What a bunch of salty c*nts ... üòÇ They're sure going to miss our cash. The gravy train is OVER, guys !!!
anti	What a daft announcement. Sure, I‚Äôm a remainer, I hate the idea of brexit and think it‚Äôs going to throw our economy back 50 years, but I‚Äôm quite relaxed about actual brexit day and I‚Äôm sure most of my kind are as well. Nobody s going to riot about brexit, at least nobody on the remain side. But what we all should be wary about is what comes after that as the pain starts to set in and brexit voters realise that they have been had by brexiteers lies. That‚Äôs when the 5hit will hit the fan not on brexit day.
pro	What a despicable woman. We voted OUT DO NOT GO AGAINST WHAT WE VOTED FOR
anti	What a disaster, no winners here now.
anti	What a disgrace. Leaving the EU for incredibly futile reasons that wont' be fixed anyways. This will be seen as the mistake of the century.
pro	What a fantastic, uplifting speech from @BorisJohnson ! Finally we have a government pushing for the UK, instead of the deafening whines of those who‚Äôd rather see us fail. #Brexit
pro	What a feeling - woken up to no longer having to follow those pesky EU laws! FREEDOOOOOOOM
pro	What a filthy old fart this guy is!!.....Kick the evil, corrupt, controlling EU out of all OUR Countries now!!......Please share!
anti	"What a fucking embarrassment, the EU were so graceful, telling us how we'll be missed etc and then Nigel fucking Farage stands up and basically shouts ""fuck you"""
anti	What a fucking national embarrassment these people are. It's as if they rounded up some football fans and put them in suits. Shameful. The UK is not these clowns. Sorry Europe.
pro	What a great #Brexitday
pro	What a great day for Britain. I lived there for 2 years back in the Blair era and I was hoping they would make the right choice. Now is the time to finalise everything.
pro	What a great day for Democracy, Freedom and our right to self determination as a nation.
pro	What a great leader the UK now has in Boris Johnson. So excited for our friends to have the freedom that come with Brexit!
anti	What a great moment ‚Ä¶ for Farage. He can now receive even more millions from his wealthy paymasters.
pro	What a great night that was. Stayed up most of the night to watch it
anti	What a joke, there isn/t a good Brexit
pro	What a lame headline. The UK did fine long before the corruption of the EU. They voted to leave and did. GLOBALIST news can stop the left media agenda anytime now.
pro	What a load of absolute s***e!!!!! I have never once been asked to contribute to these new polls nor do I know anyone who has. I doubt anyone in the north of England (as per usual) has even been asked. WE ARE LEAVING FACT!! Why don't BBC put in the news the secret signing by the Queen herself. This cannot and will not be reversed. Get over it & tow the line tories and remoaners you've lost. FACT!
pro	What a load of nonsense! The British voted to exit the EU. So exit! With NO DEAL. If the EU want to make that uncomfortable then UK knows who their friends are....good and strong reason to leave them in the firdt place

pro	"What a load of rubbish ""the peoples vote"" whatever that means, The People Voted and if your democracy means anything at all , Respect them"
anti	What a load of shoemakers. Poor people who voted leave had been convinced by lying scumbags like Rees Mogg and Boris Johnson that leaving would make them better off.
pro	What a load of windbags we had a vote it was leave if we have to vote again we will have to vote every year then when it was never right for these remainers
pro	What a misleading video. Free trade doesn't require political integration; the video makes it look as if the UK is cutting off all trade by leaving. Also, incredibly, left out was the refugee crisis, as if the only migrants coming to the UK were European immigrants looking for work. Shame on Vox
pro	What a rubbish documentary. Eveyone is anti-brexit? Hardly balanced!
anti	What a sad, sad day for the country
anti	What a sad, sad day. #NotMyBrexit #NotInMyName #LookAfterOurStar
anti	What a shame, I would like to see an united Europe, as an union of nations, our economies, our armies, our people united, but all the countries having their own culture, language, and roots.
anti	What a shame. We as Brits should be embarrassed‚Ä¶
anti	What a shower of shit out politicians are. These are crazy times; I wouldn't hold my breath for any sort of inquiry into this mess anytime soon.
pro	What a strange sense of cowardice that comes across from most of the commenters on here. Instead of embracing their new sense of self determination they whine like little children being forced to leave their house for the first time, full of fear and self doubt. The EU is a corrupt monster. I don‚Äôt know how any country puts up with it. Time to grow a pair and head off into the world. Independence comes with risk, but also great freedom.
anti	What a terrible situation.
anti	What a total embarrassment! Not in my name and not in Scotland's name! Showing a total lack of respect and behaving in a very infantile manner. This is cringe worthy.
pro	What a trooper you are Nigel.Thankyou.
anti	What a waste of UK time money and energy Brexit is
anti	What a waste to get rid of all the benefits of the EU.
pro	What about UK's share of EU community property? We must have paid a huge chunk towards those shiny new EU buildings we keep seeing in EU news reports.
anti	What about a referendum of rejoining the EU? it will save the democracy and also can save the UK. The referendum was not about never join the EU again. Leave then rejoin one day after. IMO: Referendum of join the EU. if its fall then leave with withdraw agreement. It its not fall, then start renegotiate with the current agreements between the EU and UK. It then would be a one day technical Brexit(or even one week) followed an empowered rejoin agreement from people by referendum.
pro	What about all the children of Europe who can‚Äôt get work because of the single currency. Don‚Äôt we owe it to them to end the madness of the EU and it‚Äôs dysfunctional currency which is destroying Europe.
anti	What about the 16..18 years old - they weren't allowed to vote, even though it'll affect them more than anyone
anti	What about the gained opportunity? All your companies that benefit hugely from restrictions on other countries that UK pushed trought (as one of the strongest members of EU). What about all the inteligence that can study in UK and then helps the economy...
anti	What an absolute disgrace
pro	What an absolute disgrace. The UK public voted to leave the EU THREE years ago. We should be out. I thought the UK was a democracy...
anti	What an absolute shambles this has become. ...We didn‚Äôt vote to leave, end of story just get on with it
anti	What an infinitely sad, painful and unnecessary goodbye to our British friends. Europe will miss you dearly, I will miss you dearly.
pro	What annoys me is how remainers try to pretend that leave had a lot of financial backing and support. Leave won because of UKIP boots on the ground and because the people wanted out. We also won because Cameron didn‚Äôt stay neutral and remain ran such a negative campaign.¬†The British people will not react well to a Brexit Betryal.
anti	What brexit rewards?
anti	What can I say, a lot of Brits are dumb.
pro	What could be better than a Europe full of individual and proud nations. The EU has effectively destroyed this.
anti	What did Britain say to its trade partners? ‚ÄúSee EU later.
pro	What did anyone really expect? The EU is basically modeled on the Sicilian Mafia, the Commorah. Capo di tutti Capi is Merkel. They negotiate nothing, apart from other people¬øs ruin. They have inherited the same arrogant swagger once initiated by an Austrian with a dodgy moustache and who also attempted to humiliate Britain.
anti	What do Brexiteers think of the decline of the pound?
anti	What do we want? Stop Brexit.
anti	What does it mean? it means 48% of the population must go ahead with something they don't want. This kind of Democracy is broken
anti	What ever small merit there might be in leaving the EU has been wasted by short sighted, ill conceived, jingoistic pig headedness. We will be worse off and have less influence in the world.
anti	What frustrates me about this referendum is whatever decision 75 yr old Brenda makes, young people will be left to deal with #VoteRemain
pro	What gets seldom said is that this is actually the best thing that could happen to the EU. The UK never belonged there. It was thwarting, sabotaging and leading the EU the wrong way. No, the agent of transatlantic dominion has been removed. That's good.
anti	What good could come from the Brexit
anti	What had the election of Trump and Brexit in common? The Mercer family, Cambridge Analytica, all with ties to Russia and Putin. Putin's plan to bring the Western world to its knees is working just fine.
anti	What happen if Uk get attack by Russian No Help
pro	What happened to it being enshrined in law that we leave on the 29th, it proves how much of a farce these politicians are
pro	What happened with Brexit was people taking back control.
pro	What has Dave got lined up next - invite Angela Merkel over to say she will invade us if we #VoteLeave?
pro	What has EU really done for us? Nothing‚Ä¶ Its enough now.
pro	What if Britain gets rid of all the outsiders and begins to flourish again? It's people will return.
anti	What is going to be of this ex wonderful country with Boris and Farage leading?
pro	What is the fuss? UK gets back control of its borders and trade. Don't see what wrong with that.
anti	What is the point with this referendum??? We all want to stay in the EU
anti	What most voters still don't realize is that the brexit referendum was basically a choice between the U.K. being a powerful European Union member state or becoming the future 51st state of the United States of America
anti	What most voters still don't realize is that the brexit referendum was basically a choice between the U.K. being a powerful European Union member state or becoming the future 51st state of the United States of America. That is basically what it will come down to on the long term. The world has changed a lot because of globalization and the rise of the BRIC countries. Nostalgia for the British Empire and economic austerity over the last decade weighed heavy on the result of that referendum.
anti	What next? Little britain gets littler, angrier & poorer, that's what
anti	What on earth am I supposed to do now? I voted remain and I'm stuck in England. This vote has put my career plans into the shitter and made me poorer.
pro	What on earth did we do for food, petrol, medicine, doctors, banks, farm workers etcetc before 1975 ? How did we survive at all ? I'd worry about Brexit if I was French, German, Belgian or a citizen of the states we've subsidized, along with EU fraud & corruption, for 40 years
anti	What opportunities ? We having nothing to gain from leaving the EU, something Hague has always said.¬†The more important question is why is Hague lying in this article ?
pro	What part of - THE EU DOESNT CARE DONT THESE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND? Can‚Äôt you see that they see us as a low level democratic people over there. We are part of a democracy and we are taking orders from non elected bureaucrats - why - because of money, because of wealth because of the economy. What about FREEDOM? What did millions of our hero‚Äôs die for? That we should give our sovereignty and Freedom over to a bunch of unelected and unapologetic tyrants. I say we BREAK AWAY. Advance Britannia.
pro	What part of exit did you not understand? EU is doomed anyway.
anti	What pisses me off most about the politicians playing power games with Brexit as the football, is that it won‚Äôt be them who may struggle to pay the rent or decide between food or heating or have permanent anxiety that their job will be lost. They‚Äôre immune to it all. #FuckBrexit
pro	What planet are those 382 remoaners on who blame LEAVERS for the Brexit division ? Are they going to blame the LibAntidems for the tories getting an 80 seat majority ? probably. The refusal to accept a democratic decision taken by the majority of the people of the UK caused the division and there was only ONE group who caused that and that was the antidemocratic REMOANERS.
pro	What problem does the existence of the EU ( club corrupt ) provide a solution to?
anti	What really stresses me out though is that the UK has really unrealistic expectations of what can be done in this one year
pro	"What the UK may have lost in trade with the EU, is more than compensated with what the UK will gain in renewed trade with the Commonwealth, SADC and BRICS. New Zealand and Australia already have trade delegations, investigating renewed trade relationships with the UK, whilst SADC would love to use British International financial expertise. The English speaking ""world"" is much larger, richer and much more powerful than the EU. The UK have the advantage of the English language. This is a very powerful tool."
anti	What the fuck are we doing. #Brexit is a choice. The wrong choice
pro	What the heck is Brexit about if not to let the UK become the UK again. Tell the EU where they can go and make a clean break.
pro	What they don't seem to get is this. The country voted to leave. That means if we reach the end of March and there is No Deal then that's how we leave. What the press doesn't tell you is the sheer panic in the EU countries whose economies will nose dive. All because Juncker et al. believe we won't do it. How wrong they are.
pro	What utter rubbish, Better to have less economic certainty now rather than be conglomerated into a European superstate
pro	What we are doing with all European countries in the European Union is sitting down and talking to them ... Spain included. It‚Äôs definitely jaw-jaw
anti	What we need is a new party. I will vote for any party that does not support Brexit at this point.
pro	What will change, everything, we are an independent sovereign nation again
anti	What will happen after BREXIT? We will move to France and apply for asylum.
anti	What will happen when Brexiteers realise they have been fed a pack of lies?
anti	What will this mean to the younger generation like me, I wish we could have vote coz this affects our future too. Does this mean university or college tuition fee will go up?
anti	What you have done!! Uk cant survive without Eu in the future you will beg to join Eu again!
anti	What's happening....#Brexit!! Shame, let's hope UK population doesn't live to regret it. The rich will be much richer at 11pm tonight.
pro	What's sad about leaving a Soviet style political entity with unelected and unaccountable officials telling us what we can and cannot do?
anti	What's the EU 'done for us'? ¬∑ structural funding to areas hit by industrial decline; ¬∑ clean beaches and rivers; lead free petrol;
pro	What's the European Parliament ever done for us
anti	What's the difference? The need to cancel Brexit is the thing that's screamingly obvious... The need to have had a plan before triggering article 50 was screamingly obvious.
anti	What's tragic is that it was avoidable. Cameron should have been constitutionally unable to call the referendum.
pro	What's wrong with waving your countries flag the European union is a toxic globalism organisation trying to kill sovereignty and national identity down with the union
anti	What, post Brexit, are they going to do that will make a substantive difference, that they could not do today?
pro	What, you mean control of our own borders, law-making autonomy and saving millions of pounds per week? Those 'consequences'?
anti	Whatever happened to sunlit uplands? Brexit food price rises and lost jobs are grim dangers that charlatan Boris Johnson conceals behind his Big Ben bong-kers farce.
anti	Whatever the outcome now, the UK will be the loser. Cur your losses and #StopBrexit
anti	Whatever the reasons the future looks harshly worsened by leaving the EU. It is useful to try to understand voting behaviour but this utility is minute compared to that wasted by Brexit.
pro	Whatever we offer wont be good enough for EU.
pro	Whatever you feel about immigration there is a huge negative sentiment mainly driven by cheap Eastern European labour. We need to apply a meritocratic skill based approach to immigration, stop having insanely counterproductive immigration laws because the back door is wide open and stop using cheap labour to fund our economic growth at the expense of our social cohesion.
anti	Whats idiotic is that apparently a lot of the people who voted for it are already saying they want to take it back because they were either ignorant, or they didn't think their vote would do anything.
anti	Whats the difference between a flatearther and a brexiteer. NONE!!
pro	Whats the point of freedom of movement with out freedom of speech ?, freedom of expression ? and most importantly freedom to choose democracy .... The EU is run by old men trying to impose their will of politics on the modern people of Europe .... first and foremost old men and women democracy is the most important thing... You promise a Liberal EU but in effect you are at heart tyrannical...
pro	What‚Äôs more important a national referendum of all the people or a vote of a few hundred MPs bought by Eurocrats in Brussels? Remainers: whichever vote favors us, but regardless we are the ones for democracy in action!
pro	What‚Äôs up with libs thinking they can overturn any election results they don‚Äôt like? This is how civil wars get started.
pro	What‚Äôs with the #StopBrexit guff? #Brexit happened last night legally at 11pm because as a proper democracy we respect how people voted.
pro	What‚Äôs wrong with no deal? Australia does $100 billion a year in trade with the EU without a deal
anti	When Boris and Gove say that 'we have taken back control', who do you think 'we' is? It's not us, the people. Not in a country governed by Tories elected by a minority of the electorate. Not in a country where the House of Lords, unelected, can over-ride the Commons. Where bishops - men in frocks with big hats - can vote down Commons decisions. At least the EU parliament is democratically elected. This is an awful day for the UK, and especially for England. The only glimmer of hope is for a reunified Ireland and independent Scotland going forward into the future in the EU leaving England and Wales lonely and on the outside with very few friends.
pro	When Brexit won, I smiled the whole day
anti	When Brexiters say they are happy to pay any price for sovereignty... Does that really mean they want economic collapse, jobs lost forever, businesses & young people in exodus, obscene price increases?
anti	When I have children I'll them if they don't work hard at school they'll end up like these Leave types.
anti	"When I heard the cheering Brexiteers sing ""England rules the waves"", I knew the situation was much, much worse than I initially believed it to be. When whole hoards of people don‚Äôt understand how insulting and degenerated it is to sing exactly this song, then indeed, we are back in Germany 1930‚Äôs. That song is only to be associated with war, oppression, theft on a global scale, bloodshed... Shame upon those terribly low-life elements, shame!"
anti	When I read pro brexit people posting their arguments I always think that has to be sarcasm, but the amount of stupidity has no limit apparently.
pro	When I voted leave I did so to end our EU relationship, that is what Leave means, let's go for brexit
pro	When I'm asked why I voted to #LeaveEU I think back to this in 2006 and the devastation of skilled workers who lost their jobs at a profitable plant.
pro	When Ireland was compared to California I realised I made the right decision by voting Brexit.
anti	When Putin and Trump are the only two looking forward to a Brexit its quite clear how bad a decision is.
anti	When UK joined EEC in the 70s there were 3 main reasons listed in UK goverments White Paper: 1) EEC countries were growing faster than UK 2) UK‚Äôs role in the world had dimished and 3) the future is in Europe. UK was backrupt in the 60s and in the 70s IMF had to fund UK. In EU UK prospered. Forgot this ?
anti	When We together we are Stronger, when we divided we are weaker.
pro	When a second country leaves, the dominos will fall like leaves from a tree at 1st freeze. No country will wish to miss out on free trade, not controlled by some unelected officials in Brussels.
pro	When are the Tories going to stand up for the democratic will of 17.4 million BREXIT voters and give them the clean BREXIT they voted for?
anti	"When are you people going to realise that Nigel Farage is just a one-trick pony? Brexit..Brexit..Brexit..and then what? As soon as it's obtained, he'll walk away, and leave people directionless again. Brexit is not the end, it's only the beginning, and what use is another ""Tory-lite"" party, who won't give this country the change it so badly needs. At least UKIP have a plan for what happens ""after"" Brexit. Gerard Batten has actually done a great job of turning the party around, despite the MSM totally boycotting him from air-time."
anti	When brexit becomes Regrexit
anti	When ignorant people vote, you get Trump and Brexit, both complete disasters.
anti	When it comes to something like Brexit, I am part of the liberal-media London bubble, and so, to me, voting to leave was madness.
anti	When leave voters are sick of Brexit and struggle to give a reason why they voted the way they did, I think it‚Äôs time to stop this madness.
pro	When one looks at the damage caused to the UK economy by the EU we are well off out. Grants co Cadbury's owners to relocate a factory to Poland ,over fishing of our waters. Aid for Valeo and Twinings to establish operations in East Europe are reported in the FT
pro	When other nations find out how well we have done in the future without the EU, they will leave too
pro	When such so called important figures in our political hierarchy are clearly working against the voters' interests surely they must be removed. I refer specifically to Hammond and Bercow whilst the PM herself is no enthusiast for leaving, she at least is not working deliberately against it. Bercow and Hammond are and must be removed surely.
pro	When that Sunderland vote came in, I jumped in the air. That's when Remain,EU arse lickers and the establishment knew they had lost
pro	When that Sunderland vote came in, I jumped in the air. That's when Remain,EU arse lickers¬†and the establishment knew they had lost
pro	When the EU see that we are really leaving with a no-deal they will fold up like an old paper bag. And all those traitorous expats will lose their health cover and right of residence and have to sell their EU home at a big loss. Boo-hoo! Haha!
pro	When the EU was called the common market with a membership of 6 nations back in the 1950s it was a pragmatic and even noble 'union' based on trade. This was post war, European countries were skint, populations depleted, Germany was rubble, France was in dire straits. A loose trade alliance was a good thing. Tragically by the early 60s it became a German/Franco carve-up which morphed into the democracy despising, nation destroying EU mutant we have now. Their goal: a superstate run by France/Germany via unelected, unaccountables with a pretend, sham Parliament to give the false impression of democracy to con the people of Europe. 10,000 EU officials earn more than the UK Prime minister. They have their own shopping maul. Chauffeur driven, 1st class flights and hotels, huge expenses all paid for by the people of Europe. Their goal is to rule Europe from Brussels. For 60+ years this agenda has been hidden, secret, now it's out in the open and cannot be allowed. It is Nato that has kept peace not the EU. Yet another EU lie/myth. History has shown what happens when a small group of 'elites' end up ruling over the many. It never ends well. People tend to suffer the consequences for decades until they cannot take anymore. Had Remain won - each month, each year ordinary peoples right would be erased, bogged down by endless oppressive rules and regulations. Democracy all but dead. A dark path. Thankfully the UK is about to leave. Eventually the EU will either sink into the abyss, split or change entirely. For 5 minutes back in the 1950s the EU had it right - a trade alliance of democratic nations. For the other 60+ years it has got it wrong. The UK has got it right.
pro	When the European people wake up they will realise that the EU has evil intentions and will want to leave it as the UK did.
pro	When the UK is finally free from the EU Extortionists, the UK can finally get down to business in growing the Economy, that will have monetary revenue now in UK Control that can now be used to uplift the Civil Service pay scale Sector.
pro	When the UK joined the EU in 1973, we had 20% of the votes. Today we only have 9.5% of the votes. #GoBrexit
pro	When the UK leaves others will follow. The EU is dying.
anti	When the brexit crashed pound hits the fan the streets will be paved with gold...

pro	When the girl learned that I was pro-Brexit she considered it a personal betrayal
pro	When the next Eurozone crisis occurs and Italy, amongst others requires a massive multi billion Euro bail out, Brexit will be viewed, as dodging a barrage of bullets.
anti	When the original vote was subject to serious amounts of manipulation, fear-mongering and other tactics, then why should it stand?
anti	When the people who voted for brexit lose their jobs I will happily tell you I told ya so!!!
pro	When they can cheat knowing they‚Äôll only be fined pocket money if they get found out, this is not a functioning democracy. #Brexit #arronbanks
anti	When they negotiate actual trade deals then they‚Äôll feel the impact of Brexit. Who will be in a position of strength? Not England.
anti	When we get our final say/2nd referendum vote, and we will, the debate is going to be fascinating. Are the Leavers going to base their argument on the parcel of lies they fed to us during the 2016 Referendum? Given that every one has been clearly and firmly nailed you would be forgiven for thinking they would be utterly stupid to do so. But what is their alternative? New lies? But what would they be based on since they pretty much covered all the issues with the first lot. Going to be very interesting.
pro	"When we leave the eu i will celebrate it as ""independence day"" where we get to take our country back!"
pro	When will some on the left wake up and realise the EU works in the interests of corporations.
pro	When will the USA be smart of this and get rid of all the illegal immigrants hear. All they do is trash everything like they did in their 3rd world countries & take the money that belongs to real US citizens. Everyone needs to go back to were they came from and fix their own countries.
pro	When will the penny finally drop with these EU autocrats - they are in no position to make demands on the UK.
pro	When will these whining gits get it? We're leaving. The EU are the enemy. Suck it up.
anti	When will you admit you‚Äôve removed the rights of 60m UK citizens to live, work, study, retire in 30 countries?
anti	When your country goes right. it goes right into the trash can.
pro	When your government no longer represents the will of the people it's time to remove that government.
anti	When you‚Äôve all lost your jobs and going to food banks maybe then, just maybe the message will get through how stupid this whole thing is.
pro	Where are the videos on the benefits of leaving?
pro	Where do I begin? For starters, the U.K. is a net financial contributor to the EU (despite the rebate) so we will be saving several billion pounds a year.
anti	Where is the end? To stop this arrogance, admit the mistake and move to the best solution. What the UK needs least is another politician‚Äôs debate.
pro	Where is the money coming from to rescue France and Italy, both on the edge of disaster, Germany will follow uk
anti	Which clearly shows how there are NO economic advantages to leaving the EU. Brexiters promised better trade deals than the ones the UK is currently part of would be negotiated and ready to sign by the time of your departure. That never happened. Brexit is a SCAM. The only real reason for it was a handful of billionaires‚Äô TAX AVOIDANCE, and the only reason for millions of voters supporting was XENOPHOBIA.
anti	While I agree that there are problems with mass migration, and British voters have the right to vote on a referendum, Cameron was an absolute dunce to even allow the vote. Brexit, while popular in some circles, will cause havoc in Europe.
anti	While I agree with your sentiment that this is typical overreaction from the market, the real (negative) effects of the out campaign will creep in more slowly: a weaker Union, relative isolation from the economic power of the remainin EU, and the gradual realization by Out voters that their lives are not soon improving.
pro	Whilst we may be down a little in the short term, i believe the strategic advantage of being out of the EU, particularly in terms of agility, will pay off in the long run.
anti	White people think that the immigrants are just gonna disappear into space now
pro	"Who CARES about the world economy. Each nation needs to worry about their own. GB's economy would be much better if they left the EU because then THEY could make their own decisions about the direction they need to go in trade and such. Not to mention, when you are paying for millions of people to come to your nation and live without working or doing anything that would better the nation and people, your economy will always be bad. Where does the money come from to pay for all of these ""Refugees""? Lots of different organizations and programs but they all come down to the original spot, the taxpayers that work and pay taxes. Great Britain needs to bail on the EU before they themselves are eating up by it. Several nations in Europe are essentially gone, look at France, Germany, Brussels and others. GB isn't far behind and will meet the same fate if they don't rid themselves of the EU, close their borders tight and start kicking out ""refugees"" and other troublesome Muslims that have no intention of assimilating into GB but want to make it theirs with Sharia. In America we need to clamp down on our border, kick out ALL illegal immigrants, STOP bringing in Refugees and start sending some of them back. We are almost $20 TRILLION in debt thanks to Obama and the Liberal disease. We cannot afford to just give away more money to people that want to come here, not work, not assimilate into America, but essentially take it over with their culture and so called religion."
pro	Who actually cares about Immigration?! I don't like the fact that laws can be passed in Brussels and we have to implement them without a say. They also take plans and suggestions from large companies and lable them as new EU legislations. Things like building new roads as it will make it easier and cheaper for companies and heavy industry to traid so the CEOs bribe the EU into doing meaning its funded by the tax payers. Its so corrupt.
anti	Who are now going to ruin the UK for ever.
anti	Who are they going to blame once they're out of the EU or, and I am translating from Brexiteer English, once they've taken their country back?
anti	Who can I trust? All I know is that I voted remain and I have no regret.
anti	Who can we blame next to get a war started! How in Gods name could someone working for Japanese car companies vote for Brexit when they were told it would cost them their jobs.
pro	Who cares about the price of my property dropping ? Who cares if some companies take their business elsewhere ? Who cares if we are seen as the black sheep ? I'll be fine with my blue passport.
anti	Who cares anymore. Bring the cuts, cuts, cuts. Maybe the idiots that voted for this shit show will wake up and realise what everyone else already knows? Until then I won't shed a tear for anyone who wonders why their lives are poorer.
pro	Who cares what Boris does as long as he helps us get out of the bloody EU, one man's career pales into insignificance when compared to the vital issue of our place in Europe, make no mistake Europe is heading into the abyss, don't let it drag us there with it...vote out!
pro	Who cares what the EU agree - we're out of here.
pro	Who cares what the EU says about us? The important fact is that we were suitably intelligent to see that being a contributor (never legally a member per international law) was a pure waste of time, effort and money. Our leaving will in future come to bring benefits beyond our wildest dreams.
pro	Who cares what the Germans think. They are always happy to live under a dictatorship. Britain isn't.
pro	Who cares. We've left this lot of losers now. They are all insignificant to the UK.
pro	Who cares? The EU is better without the UK.
pro	Who cares? We're gone now. That's all that matters.
anti	Who do we trade with if we opt out? Because other nations like Australia, newzealand, America, and many Asian, African, and European countries ply their Trade within the EU, Forget all this go it alone, the truth is we need the EU.
pro	Who do you think is going to pay for all those immigrants. Taxes will go up and the standard of living will decrease. And no more aid for the third world. Ha
pro	Who does he think he is? Our waters, our fish! If you want our fish, buy them from us.
anti	Who gives a shit about those nasty bureaucratic details? Brexiters will solve it all with their famous magic wand. So what
pro	Who in their right mind would want to stay in the EU after all of this! üòÇ
pro	Who is actually interested in revenge apart from boneheads ? Actually sending them our mouthiest halfwit (that's you Farage) for their parliament seems to punish them enough.I would prefer a mutually beneficial relationship - and I am sure so would most in the EU27. I would prefer a mutually beneficial relationship - and I am sure so would most in the EU27.
anti	Who is going to pay for the Irish wall? The mexicans?
anti	Who is this supposed to fool? Brexiters won‚Äôt care until after they feel consequences of hard Brexit and the rest are not going to fall for this nonsense.
anti	Who knew their were as much stupid people in Britain as there are in America. Stupid and gullible people are everywhere!
pro	Who said #BREXIT was not about racism and Xenophobia? Proud to be British eh? Sovereignty eh? Freedom back eh? happy? #HappyBrexitDay #voteleave #HateCrime
anti	Who the English will trade products now Americans takes from China for 1dollar each how British worker will compete with Chinese workers
anti	Who will conservatives blame once we are out of the European Union
anti	"Who's going to do the low-wage jobs, in the absence of immigrants? No one, unless we abolish welfare, thereby giving our native-born scroungers two options, ""Work, or die"". The Old Labour types will rue the day they voted for Brexit."
pro	Whoever it was made the mistake of assuming the EU would respect the UK contributions to the organisation over many years and treat the UK with some respect, unfortunately he/she misjudged the EU's morality.
anti	Whole this drama with Brexit showed us the following: 1. democracy mechanism is broken 2. government is very unprofessional and populistic 3. we can only hope for the best :)
pro	Whoop! We left... Oh yeaaaaaaa! Definitely was an out from me, and I'm young before people blame it all on the older generation
anti	Why Brexit, why...
pro	Why I've voted #Brexit: for democracy, popular sovereignty, & a more open future.
anti	Why am I so fucking miserable today? We got are laws back. Are sovrenty. We‚Äôre not being governed off an EU. And yet here I am, feeling like I want to crawl under the bed and hide from every person in the world. I‚Äôm not angry, I‚Äôm just disappointed
anti	"Why are #Brexit supporters still angry? They've ""won"" haven't they! Or maybe they've just always been angry and nothing will ever please them!"
anti	Why are UK citizens blaming the EU for their local austerities? That is muddle-headed. Expressing anger is fruitless unless it lands on the people with the power to do something about the problem. The EU doesn't tear down rotten buildings in a small town. The EU doesn't build playgrounds or see that the grass in parks is mowed. That isn't its function. People can control their government using intelligent activism, starting at the local level. If the people elected to power aren't doing the job, consider choosing another. Grousing is for releasing pent up anger and frustration but positive change needs method, committment and steady command of the facts. Local problems start with local solutions. Seek the change you desire from your community, your friends, your family and yourself. Organize, identify goals and then pursue the means together. Before leaving a trade agreement that delivered prosperity, citizens need to know explicitly what they will lose, what they will gain, and how they will mitigate the negatives when they occur. People have to do this on the mundane level every day, and it is called 'common sense' or 'being practical' or 'thinking things through'.
anti	Why are people against a united Europe anyway?
anti	Why are people so surprised? Can anyone remember why the UK is actually leaving? I've lost the plot now. I'm sorry I can't keep up.
anti	Why are remainers so bothered about no deal brexit? Let those who voted for it suffer the ensuing economic hardship. They said they‚Äôd had enough of experts anyway.
anti	Why are so many people in the UK politically ignorant? Is this a failure of our education system? And, if it is, why is this the case?
pro	Why are they asking an Irishman about Brexit.
pro	Why are we not aloud to preserve our national identity, ¬†we just want our quiet way of life in our British community's and would just like to be left alone.
pro	Why are you harping on about the Irish border on the no deal - who cares - put a border control up if need be jeez its not the biggest border in the world
anti	Why aren't the brits panicking?
pro	Why arent there fireworks being sold to mark the moment when we leave the port that is the EU and finally set sail
anti	Why can't we just do the vote again? Most people regret choosing to leave anyways.
pro	Why cant EU just be a trade union for which UK had actually signed up for?
pro	Why can‚Äôt these people accept democracy? If you like the EU so much, to and move to any EU country
anti	Why change, when there is not so much wrong
anti	Why did the UK not defeat crime and transform the NHS all along? Nothing was stopping them
anti	Why did they vote leave? Cos they're uneducated.
pro	Why did we ever join this corrupt empire in the first place?...
pro	Why did we join the EU in the first place
anti	"Why do leavers write like football hooligans? I was around before the EU. We joined because we could see we are too small to cope on our own. No bargaining power. Suddenly we are making Britain ""Great"" again. Are we going to bring back the Empire? Won't happen, mate, dream on."
pro	Why do people act like the first referendum was undemocratic and like it never happened... Man the disconnect from the people vs the government in the UK seems to be pretty blatant. Just leave the EU already.
anti	Why do people think brexit means more trade with the rest of the world? This fallacy is equal to the ¬£350m for the nhs. Brexit equals lower bargaining power with the Chinese, Canadians, Indonesians etc.
pro	Why do some people are still daydreaming about remaining in the EU or a second referendum? They so have lost touch with reality. We're leaving the EU in March 2019. Period.
pro	Why do the looney fanatical little europeaners, think that being in the EU club is the world! When we leave your little meaningless power grab, we will be back in the world .
pro	Why do the media always say ‚Äúuncertain future?‚Äù These are the English! The majority of them have backbones. They‚Äôre going to look to the future and their newfound freedom. Good luck to them. KBG Keep Britain Great üá¨üáß and the USA even greater
pro	Why do the remoaners not realise the EU is broke why else are they determined to get our money ?
pro	Why do these bias networks think anyone listen to them anymore, it's a winners brexit, not a remainer traitor losers, leave won and it will be done.
pro	Why do they always consult pensioners or people with not much to say on Brexit. Interview me... I'm 34 and I have a lot to say about why we will be better off outside of the bloc.
anti	Why do they even leave eu they lose money for no reason.
pro	Why do they keep coming up with stupid comments. Farms in England could provide if allowed.. people can grow their own like they did years ago
pro	Why do they never talk about the good parts about leaving the EU? I like how everything tried to push England into voting in, but we were like no, let's just see what happens if we leave.
pro	Why do vox look at this as a bad thing ,being in the EU made Britain not a democracy anymore which we fought world war for ,we weren't deciding our own laws and if we wanted the right as a country to change a law we had to go to Brussels to earn back which cost millions while doing so .Also we're not against all immigrants ,we don't mind the educated working ones ,it's the ones that are here illegally receiving child benefits and so on which we shouldn't have to pay to them but the EU says we must until just a few months ago when we had to fight for the right to make this our own decision . So who in Britain benefits from the EU ? Well I'll give you a clue ,it's not the average middle class working majority of Britain but the mp's ,politicians and so on ,so if they have any say in this they will encourage people to stay as it benefits them . Learn your facts vox.
pro	Why do we pay our mp's for years it seems they have done nothing,cannot make decisions.Hide behind the EU, They gave the electorate the decision about leaving.We decided.Once we leave we will then sort you lot out.
anti	Why do we want Brexit at all if we simply end up in a more unfavourable position? We should revoke Article 50 whilst we can.
anti	Why do you keep saying there are so many immigrants yet are overlooking fact that 2 million UK citizens moved to Spain since 1973?
pro	Why do you need to governed by the French and Germans?¬† You are an Englishman.¬† Stand up.¬† Have some backbone.
pro	Why do you think that they are making it so awkward for Britain to leave, they are panicking their best customers are going to buy elsewhere
pro	Why does the UK have to give up on self-rule to do business with the rest of Europe? The answer is, they don't. The United States doesn't have to submit to a European Court, a European Parliament or any other Euro bureaucratic monster. Free markets: Yes. Loss of self-rule: NO. It's quite simple really.
anti	Why dont people understand that immigrants are a valuable work force? Lol
anti	Why dont people understand that the uk isn't a big empire anymore
anti	Why encourage the pointless and divisive ‚Äôbattle‚Äô between leavers and remainers, as if the referendum had not already happened ? As a ‚Äôremain‚Äô voter I realise that we have to make the best of it now, and support as ‚Äôsoft‚Äô a brexit as possible. A ‚ÄôPeople‚Äôs vote/final say‚Äô would leave us open to the risk of a ‚Äôhard‚Äô or ‚Äôno deal‚Äô brexit and therefore makes no sense at all.
anti	Why everyone is hailing this like some kind of good thing is beyond me because it‚Äôs nothing to be proud of at all. Just shows English people are fucking dumb cunts. I‚Äôm actually ashamed to be from England.
anti	Why has it all gone so horribly wrong? Please tell us Boris.
pro	Why has it taken so long ?
pro	Why have a second vote when the first one has not been implemented? The referendum vote was to leave the EU, no mention on the ballot paper of a deal, or transition period, neither was there any mention of giving away our fishing waters or offering huge amounts of money for a deal. all these things are designed to lock us into the EU by the back door by a bad prime minister.
pro	Why haven't we left yet
pro	Why in the hell would any British citizen want to join the undemocratic union of the EU! The EU union is a joke. Britain stay as a Sovereignty State.
anti	Why is Theresa May so afraid of a new election and let the Briton vote again? After all, the Britons were lied with false pretenses leading to the voting of Brexit
pro	Why is anyone annoyed by this? Patriots are standing up and unified as a country. That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a great thing. I love when I see that in the U.S.
pro	Why is global supporting the EU instead of Britain? Cherry picking interviews? The people voted overwhelmingly to leave why skew the issue?
anti	Why is leaving the EU seen as a must? Just because the vote won on leaving doesn‚Äôt mean the government has to leave especially since the vote were so close. In Sweden there has been multiple referendums where the public didn‚Äôt want something, but the government did it anyway.
pro	Why is that guy spouting on about peace in Europe when he freely admits he doesn't know. What an idiot and there seems alot of remain people that have failed to educate themselves about what is really happening in Europe.
anti	Why is the government not listening to the business people of this country & actually stopping this ridiculous thing called #Brexit.. it will go down in history as an embarrassment to this country.
pro	Why is this a significance? If the U.S. left NATO they'd still have treaties... just not a special name. Why the hate against the brits, its their country F off.  love, Husky Hockey
anti	Why is this happening? Because fools voted for a pathological liar and he now has 5 years to do whatever the hell he likes. Democracy assumes the people you vote for are honest. When they're not, democracy dies. #LiarJohnson #ToryBrexit
pro	Why is wrong that Britain wants their democracy back from faceless bureaucrats in Brussels
anti	Why isn't the government listening to business people of this country, and stopping this ridiculous thing called Brexit.
anti	Why not just stay in the EU...
anti	Why not just stay in the EU... and be part of the EU, what has NEVER been done. The UK has always resisted to develop and improve live in general for the whole population. Not just the wealthy. Serious developments and changes are required in/for the UK !
pro	Why not send the EU our annual welfare bill for the 5 million EU migrants that live here and knock that off the amount...?
pro	Why on earth would anyone want to prolong the agony. We had a people's vote. Just get on with it.
anti	Why people want to build borders, can't we just be friends
pro	Why settle for trading freely just with the EU when you can have both - make free trade deals with the EU, US, China, etc. without paying into the EU and being subjected to its laws.
pro	Why should I, as an English man, care what aguments people I've never heard of with names like Juncker or Schulz are making ?
anti	Why should the EU budge, they don't have the problem?
pro	Why should we give billions to the eu when we need it here?
anti	Why should we risk the damage of a no deal Brexit for nothing but a flawed ideology?
pro	Why shouldn‚Äôt the Uk undercut the EU, in trade deals and services. The Uk has left the EU, to steer its own course in business. Not make itself less attractive to investors.
anti	Why so much hate against the EU?
pro	Why spin this into purely an immigration issue - people this is about FREEDOM. Pure and simple
anti	Why temporary dropping out of the ECHR and a no- deal brexit are all bollocks Johnson will have a very nasty collision
anti	Why the UK must waste 3 years and ¬£¬£blns of pounds chasing unicorns in order to appease few racists? Seriously why?
anti	Why the hate on the EU? The EU has been the single best thing to uniting Europe and stabilizing it.
anti	Why the victory music
pro	Why will anyone want to stay in the EU? - Do these people travel into Europe to see what is going on there?
pro	Why would Britain stay in when the EU is becoming one giant federal system?
pro	Why would anybody vote to remain within a dictatorship that is gradually grabbing more and more power. Vote leave to restore democracy and show the world how civilisation should be.
anti	Why would anyone chose the UK, there are so many better choices!
anti	Why would anyone vote for Brexit?
pro	Why would anyone want to join the EU? If the EU turned into a simple trade union, instead being a controlling government over sovereign governments, then it would be so much better. Until then, cheers to the UK from the US of A
pro	Why would anyone want to join the EU? If the EU turned into a simple trade union, instead being a controlling government over sovereign governments, then it would be so much better. Until then, cheers to the UK from the US of A!!
pro	Why would anyone want to remain in? I cannot fathom why millions would want to concede their sovereignty to unaccountable and unelected career bureaucrats!
anti	Why would people want the uk to leave whoever voted to leave is thick think about the future duhhhhhh
anti	Why would someone want the EU to fail? There are so many separate countries in Europe that it's easy to spark a war if there is no unity.
pro	Why would we believe you Dave when you continually fail to put your money where your mouth is #voteleave
pro	Why would you want to live under someone else's laws I say good riddance
anti	Why would young people want to stay after a Hard Brexit or a Crash Out Brexit wrecks their prospects.
pro	Why you make such a sweeping statement? Of course ‚Äòleavers‚Äô understand we‚Äôre close geographically (and economically) to Europe. Europe (in its widest interpretation) is not a stable and secure place. To be successful we need to be positive to all challenges, Brexit and others.
anti	Why? Why do you want to leave? How does this benefit anyone?
anti	Will someone PLEASE tell me why ANYONE still thinks leaving the EU is a Good Idea.
pro	"Will there always be an ""England""?¬† Not by staying in the EU."
pro	Will this mean the eu nationals already here will have to return home i hope so then if they want to come bac they would have to pass checks etc

pro	Wish I could relive this night it was absolutely euphoric
pro	Wish us luck when you wave us goodbye....sorry the rest of you need luck. We will be ok on our own.
anti	Wish we could do a no confidence vote and demand another election.
anti	With Brexit there are no victors, we all lose.
anti	With Brexit, London‚Äôs financial industry access to the EU market will have more regulations and obstacles, undermining the competitiveness of London‚Äôs financial services compared to EU financial services.
anti	With Brexit, it's the same as separating life partners. Parents (EU and UK) go apart, and children (people) have to live with negative consequences. By separation everyone loses.
pro	With Her Majesty the Queen's Birthday upon us, and St. George's Day within three days away, stand up all of you who love that land of Hope and Glory as I do a total stranger from a land where hatred for you is instilled from cradle to grave and beyond. ( I don't mean Australia ) Britons throughout the Centuries have stood as tall, straight, and fearless, as a Guardsman does when he is fighting for you, that is what's needed now to stop the Quislings from surrendering to a dictatorship that knows no bounds but the ones that tie Nations up in rules, and restraints, denying you the freedom to be your own Land of Hope ,and Glory. Vote to regain your soul, and sovereignty, by denying those who do not live in, nor love your Nation any say in what it means to be British so leaving you to be a sovereign Nation once again. God Save The Queen.
anti	"With Osbornomics in full flow the shock of leaving the EU will send us into full recession, but as long as we get our ""sovereignty"" back it'll be worth it..."
anti	With all the information available and very clear arguments made against Brexit especially a'no deal' one and moving on to WTO rules along with the benefits of being in the EU and any sane person is left thinking of leave supporters as a mix of anarchist's, disillusioned or not very bright individuals.
pro	With all the new calls for more referendums around EU, we can hold that this was indeed the topple of the first domino. May the EUSSR's fall be swift, and permanent.
anti	With brexit UK could risk losing a wave of investment, and with it, a raft of new technologies.
anti	With critical levels of homelessness, an NHS crisis and so many other problems which need urgent attention, can we really afford to be wasting so much time and money on a Brexit which we can all see is falling apart?
anti	With how much of a clusterfuck brexit has been so far, it's more likely to serve as a warning to member nations.
anti	With lowered security and almost no help from EU countries such as Germany and France, the UK will become a bigger terrorist target than it already was
anti	With my EU citizenship trashed, for all time ... my rights to live anywhere in 27 brilliant countries gone ... up in smoke. I am 66 ... And I say f*** to a system that gives Boris a majority of 88 MPs on the vote of 43.5% of those who voted. De Facto dictatorial power for 5 years. Not a single Tory MP who can represent my Remain point of view ... Boris got every single last candidate to swear to Brexit before being allowed to be a candidate. Idiotic and stupid are far too polite to describe the system we have. Why should anybody bother to vote when the 56.5% have 80 fewer seats than the 43.5%. And what happened to the report on Russian interference ... ? I am not proud to be British ... rather I am ashamed to be associated with this small minded selfish rather stupid bunch of people who tolerate such unfairness.
anti	With no trade deals in place and no one really needing anything you have I would say that the future for you post a no deal brexit is bleak. All your industry seems to be leaving ahead of brexit. Barclays, a bank no less, have move 190 billion in assets out of England into Ireland. You are dooming yourself, and for no good reason. This is not a gloat, I am genuinely worried about your economy and the livelihood of my British friends and family.
anti	With the possible exception of selling our soul to Trump, we could have done all these things while we were in the EU. We couldn‚Äôt be bothered then, why should we have any faith now?
pro	With you all the way
pro	With ¬£39 Billion invested in to our own economy, instead of being frittered away to the Eu, its more likely that we will be rejoicing in the streets, ¬£39Billion will end Austerity and will save the NHS, with plenty left over.
anti	Withdrawing Article 50 *is* the only sane thing to do. After that is done, those who peddled the Brexit lies should be brought to trial. The damage they have done to the country - and will do if they are allowed to go any further with this madness - is almost incalculable.
anti	Within 10 to 25 years, the United Kingdom will not exist as it does today. Northern Ireland, Scotland, and maybe Wales will secede from the United Kingdm and rejoin the EU.
anti	Without EU England is nothing this days
anti	Without access to EU's market, the City (and the UK) becomes irrelevant n the world's affairs!
pro	Without our EU budget contributions, we could give everyone a 60 per cent council tax cut

pro	Wo wo wo Brexit brings the end of the world and the complete collapse of civilisation is coming? Better Britain stay in EU then?
pro	Woke up to a bright new dawn. Sun is shining, UK had left the socialist EU experiment.
pro	Women politicians...... too nice for politics. Just bloody leave! you can trade with poland, USa and Australia.... lots of other nations to trade with.

pro	Wonderful news! Finally the voice of the people of the UK has been heard.
pro	Wonderful news. Congratulations on securing a future for Britons, not paying for the rest of the EU.
pro	Wonderful news. Now scrap the BBC licence and fix London.
pro	Wonderful news. We are out. FANTASTIC. Well done those who voted OUT.......Those who voted to remain. Have you thought of moving out? Just asking.
pro	Wonderful news...Make the United Kingdom Great Again
pro	Wonderful. Thank you Britain for leading the way. Many will follow in your footsteps.
anti	Wonderfull to see such a great demonstration now that we know the damage Brexit will do
pro	Woohoo we are free from EU :D I hope we get buddy buddy with Australia, I love Australia oh and America oh and cananda
pro	Woohoo!!! The NHS is super excited to receive an extra ¬£350 mil a week!!!
anti	Work together be proud to be European and member of the EU.
pro	Workers rights come from workers, not the EU who actively fights against them. There's a reason trade unionists are anti-EU.
anti	Worst mistake we've made in a very long time and all based on lies, xenophobia and misinformation spread by the Tories, Farage and their rich buddies in the media.
anti	Worst thing my generation will see and live through. It's not good for us as a nation or for Europe.
anti	Worst thing to happen the UK since the black plague
anti	Worth bearing in mind that as well as endorsing far right parties, Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski is deeply corrupt.
anti	Would brexiters care to tell us when that deal was signed off . No one in the EU knows about it. Brexiters dont you just love them
anti	Would someone kindly explain how the UK will ever enter again into such hugely successful co-operative ventures as AirBus, EuroTunnel, EuroFighter or the European Space Agency and CERN? Or maybe you think none of these matter and we're going to sail along with little industry relying on the parasites of the City or dubious Russian money to bridge the enormous balance of trade deficit we have.I'm just waiting for the good Burghers of Calais to stop policing the waterfront and let anyone cross la Manche: why should they bother?
anti	Would you trust him or the propaganda spouted by Boris,Gove et al ? BREXIT would be a disaster for us
pro	Wow ! they are really scraping the barrel now. next they will tell us there is no more air comming in from europe . ffs just leave
pro	Wow I feel like a new woman...so glad we waited four years for this
anti	Wow fell like children should have had a vote because we should have a better future and not have to worry about what will happen
anti	Wow it's almost like brexit is a dumb idea.
pro	Wow the multi-billion dollar company Honda is bitching about what citizens want because they might lost just a tiny bit of profits, lol.
pro	Wow! So Brexit has finally arrived. The shackles are finally off. I do hope this bold moves eventually leads to a better and stronger Britain. Congratulations.
pro	Wow! The amount of stupidity in this world still fascinates me. Just give the UK their hard brexit and let both parties deal with the consequences. All decisions have consequences (negative and/or positive). End of story
pro	Wow! This gave me goose bumps. I wish I could have been there. The visual and sound is phenomenal. Loved it!
pro	Wow, BBC totally cut Nigels speech so you didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hear how reasonable and funny it was.
anti	Wow, Brexiter is openly blatantly lying and misleading about the EU. It is basically warmongering and nobody is calling her out. No wonder why so many people were tricked into voting leave. Truly speaking the referendum was a scam, but Brits are too proud to admit it.
anti	Wow, I didn't know much about Brexit before watching this. The UKIP's views on immigration and foreigners are horrifyingly similar to the Trump administration's. I really hope this isn't becoming a global trend.
anti	Wow, just wow. Brexit is like some sort of crazy vortex that makes even the most accomplished and honest journalists write absolute, bad-faith horseshit
pro	Wow, the people of England voted to leave the EU, but because the politicians think they know best they are doing everything they can to postpone and stop what their people voted for.
pro	Wow, these lads finally did it. So Britain is out of EU for good?
pro	Wow, what a completely one sided view of Leave voters. Come and ask me why I voted leave. Immigration was bottom of my list of reasons, I'm more concerned with unelected officials in the EU Commission being the only people who can propose legislation which affects all of us. I want our laws and politicians answerable to the electorate of this country, not being dictated by corrupt old Nazi sympathisers in Brussels.
pro	Wow. The media is really going all out to scare the crap out of the British public into thinking Brexit is bad
pro	Wow. The media is really going all out to scare the crap out of the British public into thinking Brexit is bad. Methinks they doth protest too much.
pro	Wrong .They wont be forgiven for not having a proper Brexit.
pro	Wrong again matey, the only reason the EU is sitting back and waiting is because they know the snowflake MPs we have will secure a deal for them. If the UK had gone for no deal from the start, we would be out long ago, and the EU would have been knocking on the UKs door for a deal, get your facts right.
anti	Wtf is 'Brexodus', most cringe thing I've seen since 'Brexit'. please get a grip
pro	Wto requires border checks/ controls because its dealing with tariffs etc. Stop flogging the lie that it doesn't. Stop flogging the lie that the uk as a signatory to the GFA will not be responsible for breaking that agreement. Basically stop flogging lies. Tell your truth which is I don't give a damn about the GFA & I want out on March 29..end of, no need for justification, just out.
anti	Xenophobia is the main cause of Brexit.
anti	Y'all fucked up, UK.
anti	YAY! Brexit FAIL!!!
pro	YAY!! WE ARE LEAVING! Let's hope the rest of Europe follows suit so that each country can regain control of their country, their laws, culture and pride.
pro	YES YES YES! Brexit Forever. and don't you dare forget it
pro	YES! That‚Äôs what I voted for! They need us more than we need them!
anti	YOU CAN ACCEPT THE EU RULES IF YOU HAVE HIGHER STANDARDS THAN THE EU REQUIRES! HOW DUMB IS JOHNSON?
pro	YOU ONLY MENTIONED OTHER WHITE CHRISTIAN EUROPEAN MIGRANTS AND NOT THE FEW MILLION MUSLIM MIGRANTS THAT ARE A HUGE PROBLEM. THE PEOPLE FROM POLAND WANT TO INTEGRATE INTO BRITISH SOCIETY AND WORK HARD. MUSLIMS HAVE ZERO INTENTION OF DOING THIS. THEY COME TO GET WELFARE AND AS MUCH FREE STUFF AS THEY CAN FOR THEIR SEVERAL WIVES AND MANY CHILDREN. THEY HATE ALL NON MUSLIMS AND WANT TO CONQUER ALL NATIONS. THEY WANT THE COUNTRIES THEY THEY HAVE MIGRATED TO ,TO COMPLY TO THEM.BRITAIN IS SMART TO GET OUT OF THE EU
pro	YOU can all leave the UK and live in Europe if you like. The rest of us don‚Äôt mind.
anti	Ya'll fucked up and are trying to figure out how to un fuck up without admitting you fucked up.
anti	Ya'll know, our should have known, how stupid it was.
anti	Ya, Brits are really stupid.
anti	Yay! Great opportunity for the EU. Thanks to Boris Johnson we will be able to get substandard products subsidized by the UK government. Such a great deal!
anti	Yay! Now Brits can all sit in a secluded little British world of British people telling themselves how special and unique being British is!
pro	Yay! You‚Äôre free! Everyone should have a huge celebration! No more being told how to run your beautiful country! No more being told how many immigrants and from what countries you have to let in! No more of your companies being fined millions of pounds because the EU says to! No more having to accept cookies from every website because the EU requires you do that! Freedom! Your wonderful citizens deserve this! Your children will have bright futures ahead of them! I‚Äôm so proud of the British people! Good job!
pro	Yay!!! Freedom!!
pro	Yayyy finally we have left the EU dictatorship
anti	Yeah Brexit is the baddest, most selfish, loonatic thing that will happen to England in my generation, I don't want to spend an hour in customs, to be able to travel where I want I don't want chicken from US and many more things. BREXIT WILL RUIN MY GENERATIONS FUTURE! I can't believe how ppl can be so selfish to only think about themselves.
anti	Yeah I‚Äôm sorry, but a massive proportion of us don‚Äôt believe any of that. We see economic uncertainty, risky trade deals with the United States, Northern Ireland and Scotland leaving the union, and a generation impoverished of the opportunities of the rest of Europe.
pro	Yeah own free will
anti	Yeah sure... the Pound Sterling dropped 20%... racists are attacking immigrants now.... wonderful Great Britain !! Good luck !! You idiots !! .... Glad you're an island !!! Only thing we need to to is flood the tunnel ......
anti	Yeah this will not go good for the UK, we all knew it, pity they are suffering in a similar way as the US under corruption within the government
pro	Yeah well the majority voted leave years ago so it‚Äôs about time democracy kicked into action.
anti	Yeah! Who needs money and jobs? We'll survive by gnawing on our stiff upper lips and drinking our own arrogance. If you want out, GET OUT. Maybe you should have done it before you had a kid, you fucking cockroach.
pro	Yeah, Hard Brexit is the best way!
anti	Yeah, but blue passports. #worthIt. I'm joking. Crying inside.
anti	Yeah, but remember that the idiots who support Brexit will then blame the EU because they aren't getting all the benefits with none of the effort...stupid will always be stupid
anti	Yeah, don't worry, nothing will happen because of Brexit. It's just all a big show.¬†Right.
anti	Yeah, it would be stupid for the UK to leave the EU...
anti	Yeah, let‚Äôs go back to 1973, now who wants 3 day weeks, power cuts and 11.5% interest rates on their mortgage and bank rates of 8%.......don‚Äôt all rush to get some. Older people will remember this so voting to go back to it surprises me somewhat.
pro	Yeahhhhh at last we‚Äôre out of the most corrupt institution going
pro	Years of debates over nothing! People voted out and this politicians have no right to stop the democratic will of the people and must get on with the exit! ‚úå
anti	Yeh! The only good Brexit is No Brexit. End of.
anti	Yep its horriffic (I'm a Brit in the UK). Once the reality kicks in (after we leave) its going to get much, much worse. But of course its undemocratic and treasonous to have that point of view.
pro	Yep we don't need the EU and its corrupt un elected Twonks. I'm voting OUT!
pro	Yep, Aussie here. Our useless pollies are negotiating new trade deals already. Anything to kick the Europhiles in the nuts.
pro	Yep, a 'small' country.... albeit a first world economy with world wide reach, but a 'small' country. A country with close ties with a still huge Commonwealth, even today, But a 'small' country. And of course, the EU is going to ignore a market of 60million in a country that was a net PROVIDER of funds that the EU needed - even if it is just a 'small' country. Yep, the UK has a lot to fear in the big wide world as a mere 'small' country, even though it's wealth will be its own in future rather than a bottomless pit that the EU can milk ad lib. Bottom line - the UK will decide its own future, not the partisan negative perspective of those chained to the bureaucratic mess that the EU was always going to be from day one of the experiment.
anti	Yep. That people see brexit as some prize in itself...it just boils my piss. They're not even being selfish and seeking to profit at others expense. Its just pure spite. They know others are suffering more so they enjoy it.
anti	Yep. The EU is blamed for our own failings.
anti	Yep. ‚ÄòBrexit good, foreign bad, do not question, only believe Daily Express.....
pro	Yes Brexit.
anti	Yes EU will survive and reform of course, but UK will be left behind.
anti	Yes I accept new #leave reality but it shouldn‚Äôt mean that voices critical of #Brexit must stop completely. #democracy needs a functioning opposition. Trying to silence all opposition to #brexitdeal @BorisJohnson is no better than calling for a 1-party dictatorship @LibDems
pro	Yes I agree, Brexit is terrible. I don't want to live in a free, independent democracy, it's far too difficult. I'm confused, insecure and unhappy. I wish I had some unelected bloke from Belgium or Luxembourg to tell me what to do . . . .
anti	Yes I am very European, always have been always will be
pro	Yes I stand, no regrets.
anti	Yes I think Britain benefits a lot, financially, from being in the EU. I don't think there is anyone who thinks Brexit will make Britain richer.
anti	Yes and 27 prime ministers will kneel and give everything so they can support UK, wake up man
anti	Yes because cutting ourselves from Europe magically opens up new avenues for trade that weren't already there. /sarcasm Tell me, what opportunities are these? That way I can take credit when I suggest them myself.
anti	Yes but it won't be the UK, it will just be England. Wales and Northern Ireland can secede too, as can Yorkshire, Isle of Man, Channel Islands. It won't be the 5th largest economy if it starts breaking up will it? It will get relegated down quite quickly and our huge debt mountain will quite quickly become unsustainable.too. So we may be independent and stop all the immigrants coming but we'll have kicked our economy in the goolies.
anti	Yes but think of all the advantages of Brexit!!.. ahem ...er what are they actually?
anti	Yes free from any hope of economic growth and prosperity. VOTE IN
anti	Yes it has pointed out how stupid Brexit is to everyone, thanks Britain
pro	Yes lets Get Brexit Done ASAP! Parliament Democracy vs the People Democracy, where Parliament democracy Use the excuse stopping No Deal, where its NO Brexit & delaying a GE vs the PEOPLE, that want the Ref, implemented.
pro	Yes there is a bit of uncertainty in leaving, but what is certain is if we stay in this country is finished, my grand children would be in constant threat from the increase of imigration
anti	Yes we could leave but how much better would it be if our politians both national and European worked a lot harder to promote a vision for Europe rather being constrained the dismally shallow views of the economists. Europe should be so much greater than the sum of its parts. It‚Äôs a shame that some of its parts are heading towards nationalism and irrelevance.
pro	Yes we need to get out we will save billions that can be spent here
pro	Yes yes yes at last. The EU want our money and they want to shaft us at the same time and make it as awkward as possible. Time to tell them that no deal equals no money. This should have been our stance from the start!
pro	Yes yes yes. We are not in the EU. Why do we pay more for car insurance holiday insurance. Road tolls. What could we buy for 55milllion a day. We have immigrants in our street in new houses never worked taxi every where and a new car. And loads of ASB. They never came to work they came for the quote (soft ENGLISH).
pro	Yes! I'm very excited to take out country back! How any of you remainers are happy to be controlled by Germany is beyond me. You have short memories and seem to have forgotten what Germany's aggression did to our country over 2 world wars and the amount of death and suffering they caused. Even though Germany lost two world wars, they have somehow managed to take control of Europe anyway! It's just that they've done it in a smarter and more civilised way in 2020 than in 1914 and and 1939. Germany have been the ones pushing for a huge divorce bill, yet everyone seems to forget the billions that Germany still owe us in war reparations, that they will never pay back! Yet we owe them money?? My grandfathers both fought in ww2 for my freedom, and I'm over the moon that today is the day that their suffering and sacrifice is no longer in vain! Today is a good day!
pro	Yes! The country has done what it wanted and has left the 4th reich
pro	Yes! you can go it alone. You are one of the greatest countries on the planet.
pro	Yes!!!! We can finally push though all those rules that nobody can name now!
pro	Yes!!!!!!! They finally had the brains and balls to do it! Goodbye EU....Socialist governments
pro	Yes, and what relevance does that have with us leaving a fascist super state? #brexit
pro	Yes, britan should leave the E,U. Can‚Äôt afford to stay in with all this immigration and become a closed country
anti	Yes, but nobody said that you can't. What you can't do is to negotiate as a big block with others, when you are not part of that block
pro	Yes, everything is ok. Liam Fox says no-deal brexit is survivable
pro	Yes, how will we ever recover from the best thing that's happened to the country in over 30 years?
anti	Yes, it'll be the greatest act of unforced national self-harm, in modern history.
anti	Yes, it's how I feel too, but we must put our energies into fighting brexit in every way we can!
anti	Yes, let's revoke A50 and forget this stupid idea called Brexit for ever.
anti	"Yes, that's what we teach our children. Still, this decision was allegedly made by ""adults"". It will be up to the children to fix the mess their parents made through their lack of maturity."
anti	Yes, the EU must be quaking with fear with the UK saying give us what we want or we'll shoot ourselves in the head.
anti	Yes, this article goes a long way to explain what happened in 2016. I live in an area of north west England which voted Remain as we‚Äôve benefitted enormously from EU investment.
anti	Yes, we do indeed buy produce from countries with whom we do not have trade deals. But wait until the pound takes a further hammering, and our EU sourced food becomes more expensive. Prices will rise and standards will fall. And if we waiver import tariffs, it will decimate British agriculture.
anti	Yes, we lost the 2016 vote, but we're not getting over it; the result was both flawed & wrong, so we fight on to #StopBrexit
pro	Yes, we should go the way of big business and heavy bureaucracy and remain in Europe so that we lose more and more power until German bureaucrats decides all for us! But wait... neither Norway nor Switzerland are EU members yet they have free borders and allow people of Europe to work freely. How does that work and why can't Britain have that too?
anti	Yes, yes, you are not suggesting a u-turn because you belatedly realise Brexit was the stupidest idea in human history. It‚Äôs to sabotage the EU [wink] [wink]
anti	Yes, you don't like Immigrants and students from other countries. That is OK, to be a isolated and uncooperative empire.
pro	Yes,good for the UK. No more being told what to do by bureaucrats
anti	Yes. I'm disgusted by the whole thing. I genuinely can't believe we are here, in this shit situation, waiting for the shit to hit the fan. You know what? Part of me really hopes it's as bad as I expect it will be, just to sicken the fucking bastards who voted for it.
anti	Yes. You're right. To see the world move away from globalisation, from progress, really would be amazing. . . amazingly stupid. Your entire desire for this is 'wah wah in my opinion the evil leftist liberals ALWAYS WIN waaaaah.' You don't actually give a fuck about England or understand it at all. The 'England' (you've never even visited, really?) that you love exists because of the EU, not in spite of. Sure, the history is cool, the land is beautiful, but a country is only as great as its people, and England's people come from all over. The English people believe in a socialist democracy, in sharing resources and giving newcomers a helping hand, knowing that those newcomers' children and children's children will be the doctors and lawyers and friends of your children and your children's children. You are a selfish, single-minded person who wants a personal victory and doesn't give a shit about the state of the U.K., and England, whatever you happen to think England is.
pro	Yesss I want the lefties to be kicking and screaming
anti	Yest it's Racist. Stop Brexit
anti	Yesterday was my first vote: I voted to remain in the EU. I felt strongly that the EU was something which we needed to be. For me it wasn‚Äôt about politics. It was not about whether we‚Äôre Labour or Conservative, or right or left, it was about what we stand for. As a nation, could we really stand for abandoning an organisation which, although admittedly flawed, brings together so many nations in a common purpose? I hoped not. For me a vote for Europe was a vote for humanity and a vote for possibility and therefore this morning my first reaction was one of devastation. After far too many tears and a lot of anger directed towards the older generations and the politicians who failed to make this referendum moral and true, I want to make sure that my first vote, my first taste of democracy, leads to something positive. My first vote is going to lead to even stronger political engagement. It‚Äôs so important that despite this result we pull together to show the world that we are not hostile or prejudiced towards them. We have to be open to the future, and work to create a positive future. We are the future and although today our country has chosen to disregard our opinions, from now on we have to work even harder to make our voices heard. Today is the start of a new future, of a different future. Let‚Äôs not decide that everything is doomed. Instead, let‚Äôs work for a positive and accepting future of possibility, rather than the hostility that has been shown today. I know that the result of this referendum could have a huge impact on my future. I‚Äôm hoping to study German at university, but I also recognise that we can‚Äôt be too negative about today. Nothing can come from deciding that everything is damned, we‚Äôve got to rise from the ashes and show the world our capability for love and good.
pro	Yet again Britain fighting for freedom from Germany and their empire building, same old same old, we'll be liberating France and Europe again before long
anti	Yet brexshitters still bray the EU is corrupt!!!!!
anti	Yet she didn't mention 2 million brits working in EU.
pro	Yet, somehow, Switzerland has all the trading benefits and none of the negatives.
pro	Yeyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Britain. Australia wants a Trade deal over a few beers. Congratulations on getting your freedom from the 4th Reich. Sink the EU.
pro	Yipee we're out.
anti	Yippie! Let's embrace poverty, high American health insurance and expensive medication. How a once great nation is going to the dogs.
pro	You (EU) will certainly loose again.
pro	You British are intelligent enough to survive without the EU
pro	You British are intelligent enough to survive without the EU.
pro	You Europeans really have to stop this the UK is breaking up rubbish, far from it didn‚Äôt you hear the DUP speech. Also we have a 61% deficit with the EU also the EU will lose it‚Äôs biggest military asset .
pro	You Remainers need to realise one thing, we are leaders not followers, the following liberal snowflakes have had their day, it‚Äôs time to move aside & let the real patriots take control.
pro	You Scots reading this, if there is no democracy, there is no INDEPENDENCE. The EU does not Do either.
pro	You act like Britain is in a begging position when it comes to brexit when in fact it is the complete opposite seeing how Britain is Europe's fastest growing economy and is the top destination for many of Europe's manufactured products.
anti	You always know when it's all going wrong. The PM decides to keep a low profile. He avoids scrutiny. He suppresses the truth. With #BorisJohnson, this has been the case since day one. But, it's getting worse, much worse. He's losing it. Downhill from here!
anti	You and the Tory party have broken the country in two, divided families, risked the break up of the UK and degraded our economy. You will never be forgiven. History will label you as a ambitious fool completely out of your depth.
anti	You and your govt are a spent force. There is a miasma of lies & half-truths, obfuscation & deflection, & an unconvincing manner, hanging over parliament these days. You put it there.
pro	You are deluded. Corbyn lost. May remained the leader by however small a margin. Fact are facts :TU:
anti	You are going to have more immigration either way. What's more, the immigration from EU almost negative at this point. Even Polish people are going home, since they can get better jobs with higher wages in Poland than in UK... This whole thing with immigartion is asinine, it really is. EU doesn't cause your immigration problem and if anything, it could be part of solution (for whole europe)
pro	You are ignorant of the facts. Brexit is about a struggle for democracy. It's a resounding refusal to accept unelected undemocratic rule from a group of self-serving politicians who took office via backroom deals. Brexiteers couldn't be more un-Trump like.
anti	You are now born a prisoner on the island... but what was your crime ?
pro	You are right Europe just doesn't understand us and never has. We're a global nation not a European one. If we have to choose between Europe and the Atlantic we'll choose the Atlantic every time! üá¨üáß
anti	You are spot on. Why cannot others see this fact. BREXIT will be disastrous. There is no going back to the good old days when England was a Great Nation, no matter what all the leavers think, wish, dream etc. England is not a major world power or player. Good luck on trying to stand alone.
anti	You brexsitters deserve for chlorine gas even for that what you did your children.
anti	You brextremists shame my country.
pro	You can blame the Remoaners for this one. Their fault parliament was preoccupied with Brexit three years after we should have left.
anti	You can do all of that inside Europe, you just don't want to and are holding the country to ransom. For that, you will either be a footnote in history or never forgiven.
pro	You can fish somewhere else Mr Commission er but in the UK waters or tell your fellow countrymen to change there diet
pro	You can have extra time to do the paperwork on an agreed, and passed, deal - but you may not delay the actual decision to leave the EU, deal or no deal...
anti	You can invest in schools and the NHS better by not doing Brexit and you know it
anti	You can join Putin, Trump, Murdoch, Galloway, Boris, IDS etc. in their celebrations. Divided we fall.
anti	You can quit EU but if you don‚Äôt solved your own problem it‚Äôs only fiction
pro	You can see these bitter old Remainers hate the UK ,wetting themselves to see the UK fail ,The Remainer slaves can always jump ship to their EU Masters
pro	You can want a better Britain without being racist. Just because you feel that local builders being undercut by Polish ones coming in and sending money back to Poland rather than spending it on the local economy, doesnt mean you wouldnt welcome Polish doctors, nurses, teachers or whatever the country needs. As someone who married a non EU national, I found out first hand how governments were trying to look tough on immigration whilst hundreds of thousands of Europeans came in with no comeback. People didnt want it, it was foisted on them, and politicians didnt want to / couldnt say that there was nothing they can do, but there wasnt. Certainly as the price rose, and the hoops increased, it became obvious they were trying to do something, but they couldnt do anything effective. The problem is the EU and the politicians within it. Hopefully other countries will get their referendum now, but seems unlikely, until the next round of elections, when parties who promise elections will be elected.
anti	You can wave your little flags around while the rich plan to pick your pockets.
pro	"You can't agree on ""how"" to leave EU so my suggestion is just ignore the EU and eventually they'll disappear. They have no power unless you give it to them, you know, like the devil."
pro	You can't put a price on sovereignty.
anti	"You cannot ""make a success"" of Brexit. It was and is a completely doomed suicide run predicated on ""there‚Äôs too many brown people in my neighbourhood""."
anti	You cant say that the UK pays money to the EU without mentioning this, if you remove the money spend, you also have to add the money earned
anti	You can‚Äôt insist on petty nationalistic ideologies and economically thrive anymore
pro	You could have drowned in the pools created by all the melted snowflakes in Britain on 24th June 2016. Long Live Freedom!
pro	You did it Nigel. Congrats
anti	You don't get even close to the same rights as other EU citizens unfortunately. Reminder that the leave campaign repeatedly. And explicitly promised that nobody would lose a single right from brexit.
pro	You don't have to be a member of the EU to trade with it
anti	You done goofed up Britain
anti	You don‚Äôt fool anyone @BorisJohnson sounding all reasonable when you‚Äôre running down the clock to a #NoDeal disastrous #Brexit
anti	You forgot the latest #BrexitBonus, UK job seekers not considered for jobs in some industries without an EU passport
anti	You guys (UK) should head west or the Atlantic you are not Europe! Also you Scotland probably can‚Äôt be independent you probably won‚Äôt be able to join the eu and you‚Äôll struggle ALOT to find good trade deals leaving you in some money problems. If your Scottish or from the UK no offence
pro	You guys do you. I think because it passed in a vote, the will of the people should not be ignored, whether it's a wise decision or not.
anti	You guys seem to be forgetting or deliberately ignoring the level of EU spending in the UK. It's not just about money though, it's about mutual co-operation and being part of a bloc that's big enough and strong enough to positively influence World events. Maybe you think England , Wales & NI can do that alone ? ( make no mistake , leaving the EU will lead to Scotland leaving the UK) . We could and should lead Europe and that way we shape things. The grass just isn't greener out of the EU!
pro	You have NO idea of the anger revoking Article 50 would cause. Just get on with #Brexit.... which is what we voted forüëç
pro	You have a ton of support from across the pond. We can‚Äôt wait to get rid of our Democratic Party here. Keep the faith!
pro	You have my vote Boris but if you win a majority and get Brexit done, please take a little advice from one of your voters - stay connected with the People - as you have done throughout your tour of the country during your campaign. Don‚Äôt become disconnected in London from them.
pro	You have not idea what poverty is. UK have it really good, even with no deal UK will still OK. you panic but reality is money talks. everything will be chaotic for few months but the dust will set and we will be fine try to support British products and employ British citizen this will help your own house.
anti	You have to admit, this Brexit thing is turning out pretty crap. It's nothing like you imagined is it? And there aren't really any EU laws that you don't like and those laws were made with UK input for the past 40 years anyway....unlike WTO rules. I mean, you don't really want hormone saturated beef or things like regulations removed so that unscrupulous traders can cut up baby formula with sawdust and stuff like that anyway.
pro	You have your own waters, EU. Keep out if ours. The free lunch is over, messieurs. Come back only if you want your nets cut.
pro	You join the EU and you loose control over your own country.
anti	You just gave Johnson a massive majority to be as corrupt and incompetent as possible.
anti	You know everyone who voted for brexit is that one kid who‚Äôs dad worked at a chippy
anti	You know that with no deal,we'd lose ALL trade agreements we have with any country
pro	You know what Britain thinks, we told you on the 23rd June 2016, and seemingly repeat it every day, and every time you push the idea of not bothering after all. We want OUT. Out means Out, not if's no buts, no cherries, no deals, just out.
anti	You know what the worst thing is... a LOT of people who voted leave changed their mind after the results were in, they claim they didn't realise that it would be so close and that their vote would count!
pro	You know what... We were in two world wars... at the end of each one life was grim, housing shortages, food shortages, poverty, unemployment. But..... the people of Great Britain pulled TOGETHER and got through it and life got infinitely better. So then people, aren't we supposed to learn from history? History tells us pull TOGETHER and all will come out ok. Valuable lesson! Put your differences aside, stop behaving like squabbling children and support each other and your country. And may I suggest that if you don't want to do that there's still the option to move to the great EU that you're so fond of
pro	You know. There were a couple good reasons not to leave that you made, but the rest of this video was bizarrely off-point. Are you telling me that the citizens of the UK shouldn't consider what they want in this vote, that they should only listen to what the USA, China, and other nations tell them to do? And of course the EU would be against the UK leaving the EU, because the UK is one of the only two economically strong member nations it has, the other being Germany. Let's also ignore that you're suggesting that 190 million pounds (10 BILLION per year) is somehow a negligible amount of money to pay to nations that can't support themselves, because it's not the 350 that the man quotes! You said a lot of bullshit in this video, a lot more than usual, and it's sad to see you gloss over it all as unimportant, whenever you would absolutely harp on these points if it were an opponent of yours making them.
anti	You lost the Brexit campaign as this will be lost.
pro	You lot moan about the state of Britain, when it's been ruled for 40 years by the corrupt EU! Moron.
pro	"You may think it's better when we work closer together. Personally I am fed up of Britains citizens constantly being dumped on or have to pay for every mistake our ""Europe"" partners make. Sick of bailing other people out. We must leave, vote out on 23rd June!!!!"
pro	You mean how the EU lost Britain..well done to the 17.4 million Brits who voted out and who believe in self determination, self governance, independence and democracy..Hopefully it will be the beginning of the end of this failed European Union that has done so much damage to Europe..God bless Great Britain from the George Cross island of Malta
pro	You must despise democracy we already had one and we voted to leave EU dictatorship
anti	You must surely have noticed during the election they were careful to never say Brexit would be a success (as it would come back to haunt them) - they say it has to be done whatever happens because 'sovereignty')
anti	You obviously have a national death wish. All Brexit options will be bad for the UK. No Deal Brexit will be a national catastrophe.
pro	You obviously underestimate the resolve of the people of Great Britain and especially, their spirit.
anti	You old fools. The rich will now gewt even richer. Exit will not solve your propblems.
pro	You opened our eyes Nigel - thank you for all the years you have put in to show us how bad the EU is. Job well done.
anti	You overlook the point that a successful Brexit was never possible and this should have been explained before the referendum.
pro	You people really act like countries don't exist outside the EU. Hahahaha, fear here, fear there.... Fear fear everywhere. People who are afraid don't make rational choices. They don't reason or listen TO reason. You're all wrong. Britain will recover and when it does you'll be in your 'special place' holding your blanket and asking big 'Ol daddy Brtain for a handout. The people saying the young people's futures are ruined, are you fucking serious? You can't be......... The EU has done NOTHING to improve educational standards or help struggling students... Nothing. The EU doesn't care for little people, at all. It cares about power for powers sake. You have Junker calling for an EU army...........WTF people. Get a grip of yourselves. Panic panic panic.
pro	You ran the worlds biggest empire ... and now you are scared of leaving the EU
anti	You realise that by having brexit they did an estimated ¬£130bn of damage to the economy? (Until now, only to increase over time).
anti	You really kicked yourself in the teeth with this Brexit thing.
anti	You said it buster, just delay it long enough for the old and demented to give up the ghost and let the young people take us back in.
pro	You said that the end that most people want to remain the ones who voted leave but I vote leave and I would vote leave again and again and again
anti	You see? The problem¬†in the UK¬†is education: they don‚Äôt even teach you elementary punctuation rules‚Ä¶
anti	You stop paying your dues, but expect to continue to use the facilities for free.
anti	You think #Remain is big? #Rejoin will be f*cking MASSIVE... because it will include ever-increasing numbers of former Leavers when they finally realise they were lied to.
anti	You think it's bad now , wait until we actually leave! It's gonna be a bumpy ride
anti	"You think you have won. And take your day to gloat. But you have lost so much more than you know. We all have. And deep down, I think you know it too. Which is why for supposed ""winners"", so many of you are still so bitter and so angry. Rest assured, you have saddled your children and grandchildren with decades of rotten fallout to come; it is they who will shoulder the true burden of your reckless self-interest. Not you. What a petty, pointless, mean-spirited and spiteful legacy you leave behind. And what a thing to celebrate. RIP, UK - we fought for you. We really did. But billionare tax avoiders have won. For now."
pro	You very deluded young lady if you think the EU is better you obviously don't love the UK that much bye bye sees you
pro	You voted for me to help get #Brexit done & I've delivered on my promise. It's now time to unite & move forward together.
anti	You voted in favour of it, now you all have to pay the price for your poor choices.
anti	You wait and see who's life expectancy fall if brexit goes through and it will be down to all the stupid bastards who voted to leave. Oh yes, and you.
anti	You were duped by Russian hacking and misinformation, too. It gave us a clown president and it took you out of the EU. We are and will forever be brothers.
pro	You will go bankrupt without the UK. Go recognise!
anti	You won't know what you've lost until it's gone, little Britain. The utter stupidity. The incoherent mindlessness.
anti	You won. Get over it - and take responsibility for what you voted for.
anti	You would think that a Government desperate to keep the UK together would be trying to increase its contact with the Scotland
pro	You'd think after 4 years of losing, Remainers would give up by now and join the winning team hahaha.
anti	You'll have no one to blame if Brexit fucks up, Brexiteers. You got what you wanted and you now have to live with it. Who am I kidding, they'll always blame someone other than themselves.
anti	You'll never have a quiet world till you knock the patriotism out of the human race.
anti	You're all idiots! Being in the EU was better for us
anti	You're never a loser until you quit.
anti	You're right, people should unite, not devide
anti	You've always been able to do that, but you cut them. Brexit will be a yoke around ALL our necks for the next 10 years. You will be constantly humiliated, begging cap in hand to try to retrieve just a portion of the many benefits we now have in our Germany +++ deal. #StopBrexit
pro	You've been hearing about Brexit for 3 years. And it's still going. Wasn't there already a vote? Where does it stand and what comes next? What's a Hard Brexit? A 'no-deal' Brexit? What is the Irish backstop? If you don‚Äôt understand Brexit, here‚Äôs your chance to catch up.
anti	You've been living in the wrong EU. You've inhabited the EU of the foetid mind of English Europhobes who consistently and resolutely refuse to open their eyes to the reality of the European Union. It's a pity because this blindness has wrecked Britain.
anti	"You've had 2 years to deliver ""your brexit"". You have failed to do so. Now it's time for people to decide whether or not to continue with this madness. No election - a second referendum. Then an election so that Corbyn can lead us into a new era of peace, prosperity and partnership with our European friends."
pro	You've had over two years! All extra time does is play into the EU's hands. That is what they want - to delay, delay, delay. We voted to leave, deal or no deal.
anti	"You've just sold a key defence company to US asset strippers Advent. Its UK director said ""even if¬†Brexit¬†were ultimately a good thing, it would create ‚Äúsignificant challenges‚Äù and cause the UK to lose out on investment"" He applied for Cypriot citizenship in 2018. #UKForSale"
pro	You've regained sovereignty!
anti	Young people understand the impact of Brexit better.... #antibrexit
pro	Youngsters will be called up to the new EU army. We're getting EU tax codes. Cameron has signed fast track for Turkey and Merkel gives them visa free travel. EU Commissioners says they're taking over all health services, so end of our NHS. We are subsidising bankrupt countries, high unemployment, uncontrolled migration, terrorism. The EU bank is in meltdown printing money like confetti. The EU project has failed and heading for extinction. We are Great Britain and can stand on our own feet. Love your kids future. Love Britain. VOTE LEAVE!
anti	Your PM is of the same nature as Trump. The UK will be in trouble in the next years. But you believed all these liars and voted to leave, now you'll pay the price.
pro	Your all so lucky. I wish we have to leave the EU too
anti	Your faith in Brexit working out would be touching if it wasn¬øt based on stupidity and ignorance! Only when the pain of Brexit hits will you understand the scale of your idiocy! Even then you¬øll probably have delusions about reliving World War 2. Oooooo rationing!
pro	Your having a laugh,the Eu will never change,the French and Germans will see to that,it suits them how it is.
pro	Your map shows that Switzerland, a central European country, is NOT a member of the EU. It never has been. And are the Swiss people living in poverty, unable to trade with the countries around them ? Of course not. In fact Switzerland is one of the wealthiest nations in the world. So much for the NEED for a nation to be in the EU ...
pro	Your mission next #Thursday is quite simple. #Vote for #democracy, vote for #sovereignty, #voteLeave! #BBC #SKY #ITV
anti	Your question implies there was a point where it was a good idea... I have been strongly remain since the start.
pro	You‚Äôve had long enough and nothing will change the hard decision that has to be made. Get on with it. Out 29/3/19.
pro	Yup get us out of this Union!
anti	Yup, all that and more is written into the Political Declaration, and Boris signed it. A bad mistake, but are we surprised.
pro	Yup. Do not believe the leftists lies and Brussels.
anti	Zero tariffs? Lol. Good luck.
pro	a 'coup' is an illegal take overBrexit was not. Although since then, we have been betrayed by the government...
anti	a dark cloud has descended onto me and I swear the gloom is directly related to how I feel about Brexit, the increasing hatred seen on our streets and the direction the country is going in
anti	"a lot of ""leave"" voters already admitted to regretting their vote as it was more a protest vote and they didn't think about the consequences."
pro	a shed load of new laws from the eu where waiting¬† till after the vote, thank nigel (god) we got out.
anti	a stupid decision, made by stupid people, who had no idea what they were voting for
pro	a) Thanks for asking for rational debate - I just got told I was being 'offensive' on r/unitedkingdom for wishing people 'were less explosive' and would actually engage with the debate rather than resorting to abusive rhetoric on both sides. (You can probably tell that rubbed me up the wrong way) b) The UK is the fifth strongest economy in the world - something pro-EU campaigners always pass over when saying leaving would destroy us economically. The EU can't feasibly halt all trade with the UK because that is not really how it works, and many many countries not in politically unified blocks survive economically. All the arguments have been made by other comments so check those out. c) My main reason in sovereignty. I dislike the necessity of only really expressing my democratic right by electing representatives because we only actually have vague guarantees on how they will conduct their role as a representative and their decisions are more about their views than it is about ours. With that in mind, the idea that MEPs can elect someone on my behalf is ridiculous because in reality I have absolutely no say. If only a huge minority of the population has any say in such elections, that is not democracy. d) I don't deny there won't be a negative consequence over leaving the EU, it is a very real possibility, mainly because uncertainty makes people nervous. In fact that seems to be the main point that pro-EU arguments make. BUT that doesn't mean leaving isnt the right decision. The unelected leaders of the EU/European Commission have said too much nervewracking things about undermining the sovereignty of members states (including removing the UK's seats on the UN, G7 ect in favour of integrating them into EU seats which gives us far less say in world affairs) to make me happy to remain in the EU. Fear of short term disruption, which will occur after any big change is not a satisfactory argument against long term change for the better, because that would mean we could never and would never change anything, and are slaves to the status quo and may as well not have democracy because making decisions is on the whole a bad idea.
pro	absolutely no eu fishing in british waters.
pro	after the blip in our democracy in 1975 we are back on track as a free nation and democracy. now we need to fight against political correctness and get free speech back
pro	all EU flags should be handed in and incinerated by the gov
anti	all that austerity for nothing and the brexitanian cult is still desperate for its apocalypse
anti	all this because white people would rather destroy their own nations than live next to people of color. Same thing happening in the United states
pro	all you need to know is that the UK will be a better place to do anything and everything because the Brussels bureaucracy will no longer hold sway in this country . Amen .
pro	already done people voted together out f EU dictatorship
anti	already gone and never going back, the wonderful world of the EU countries has a level of peace happiness prosperity and civilisation that sadly the UK will never have again in my lifetime
pro	am English & voted with many of my friends family & people from the same street to LEAVE the EU. We simply do not think it is a good idea to be ruled by a foreign power that does not have our best interests in mind & would like to control our borders. This is a very small country that is nearly full. This man is a liar & a fool. We are not racists - in fact as a country we are remarkably tolerant. We realised that to leave may make us poorer but felt that this was a cost worth paying.
pro	am from London and i dont think people in the North of England are racist all of us that voted to leave done the right thing. because if we didn vote leave imagine how overpopulated an unrecognisable this country will be in maybe 20 30 40 or 50 years if we stay in the E.U this country will not look likr England no more and it will never be again
anti	"an people in their 60s stop saying We'll just take the hit"" on Brexit. YOU WON'T BE THE ONES TAKING THE HIT. Your careers are either already established or finished. Some of us are are trying to get started. Some of us will have to support families in Brexit economy!"""
anti	and higher prices, int'l marginalisation, recession... Whoops!
pro	and staying in will see us bled by EU commissars
pro	and the there's people crying into lit candles, speaking about it being a grieving process? it feels like her europeaness has been taken away haha. no it's your brains what's been taken away love.
pro	and yes this great country of united kingdom have helped to liberate europe twice ,so we know only to well what freedom means.
pro	and you wont get our money , then watch your glorious united states of europe fall apart , under monetary pressure . prick .
anti	and, as per usual, Conservatives can break anything, but have absolutely no idea how to fix anything...
pro	"another panel of """"so-called-experts"""" every time that remoaners try and demonise Brexit or the Brexit negotiations or put Boris down they always claim its by a """"panel of experts"""" and mostly its just """"one person's opinion"""" one self important up their own ares's personal opinion, and rarely has anything to back it up with, just words and opinions """"nothing else"""" and they're so arrogant that they think everyone should listen to them and hang on every word """"but people are not that stupid"""""
anti	any political leader who speakes about UK leavindg the European Union ,is in fact an enemy of the democracy and freedom.
anti	anyone who thinks Brexit is STILL a good idea is delusional and too scared to admit that it‚Äôs wrong.¬† Stop Brexit
pro	as a British person watching this video, it's very biased against the Brexit position. Brexit is about Democracy and support for Brexit is as Strong as ever.
pro	as a remain voter i was saddened. but a year later. im now glad the leave vote won. And glad to give the EU the middle finger.
anti	as an American I will say it's a huge mistake to leave EU.
anti	as an asian looking at this 'brexit' from far away, it will not be an 'apocalypse'...but it will certainly bring lots of damage to uk...i think many british people still have too much pride from their 'empire' days...the truth is uk were strong whenever they were either in a war with another country or had colonies...i'm not an economy expert or a politics expert..but this whole 'brexit' thing came out of stupid ignorance
anti	as crazy as it sounds i think british still haven't anderstood anything to the brexit.
pro	as i Brexiteer i can tell you the people who voted leave would rather live in a river than be governed by the EU.who would want to be associated with a dangerous,desperate ideology like the EU
pro	ask the EU nothing tell them what needs to happen and that they have 1 week to make up their minds if not we leave no deal and you loose 39 billion simple
pro	"at the very least.... the British people are back in charge of their own future, and will prove the ""People"" are once again correct."
anti	aww poor little victim Brexiter pensioners..... afraid of Islam,afraid of the EU... just retreating into a little England comfort bubble of Daily Mail hate, whispers and vitriol. Come on guys, seriously? what have you become? Peace and Love.
pro	ban¬†Islamfrom the west
anti	based on the fact that UK politicians are panicking and EU politicians are not - the answer is pretty obvious.
pro	basically we can flourish outside the EU like Norway, Switzerland and Iceland etc.

pro	i cant speak for other people but that amounts to tyranny in my eyes, people in germany dont really care about people in the UK at least not in the same way that two people from the UK care about eachother and why would they i dont care about them we share a different culture and set of principles, i bare them no ill will but we shouldnt make decisions for eachother i dont want to lord over europe and i dont want europeans lording over me its as simple as that.

pro	i must be an exception because im 17 and although i cant vote if i could i would have voted leave
pro	i voted leave and proud to do so
anti	i voted leave just because i thought it the right thing to do, i thought it will help our country somehow but now i just want Brexit to be gone we are destroying our economy it crazy.
anti	i voted remain , not that it really matters now, the EU in some form or another will continue, no one wants fines, trade embargoes, sanctions and challanges in trade between the UK and the EU
pro	"i voted to leave because; when we had our mp expenses scandal one mp said""thinkyourself lucky your not bliving in europe its a hundred times worse there, recently a study on corruption within the eu claim 144 billion gone in corruption with a total cost of 800 billion, i didnt want to pay for our own corruption let alone the likes of bulgaria,croatia, greece and italy"
pro	i was¬†never¬†asked if i wanted to be irrevocably bound by laws set by an unelected commission
anti	i'm american, but from an outside standpoint, i like the eu. it just seems like a good idea-the countries are stronger together, and it means that the only wars in europe are from other continents. in fact, i think we should have something like that with canada and mexico! it would probably help to solve a lot of economic problems, especially in mexico, it would fix the illegal immigration issue, and it would ensure that the hostility trump sparked with mexico didn't turn into actual fighting.
anti	i'm just getting drunk until well in the morning then see what shit looks like tomorrow, probably still be the same but somehow tomorrow lost, the real storm will happen at the end of the year for brexit to take affect, well what a stupid country we have now
anti	i've got a solution for this mess: i think May should ask the EU to reopen negotiations.
anti	i, like many my age, votes ‚Äòremain‚Äô it was (in the majority) the older generations who most likely won‚Äôt see the impact whom voted ‚Äòleave‚Äô
anti	if anyone leaves it will end with war I just know it
pro	if brexit vote by the public does not count then each time people vote for a new government then that vote does not count so let's just have a dictatorship
pro	if everyone wants to know why Britain left the EU watch the movie that was made about which you can find free of charge on youtube. the name of the movie is Brexit. it is very informative and explains everything for Britain's perspective.
pro	if it wasnt for Britain you would be writing this in German and not Spanish! ..... good luck fishing and enjoy your precious EU toilet hole.... your welcome to it!
pro	if the Lisbon treaty isn't a good enough reason for us to leave the eu then i don't know what is
anti	if the UK leaves the EU, its gonna be a disaster for the British citizens, Economic crisis for the whole Uk
pro	if the majority are supposed to be pro-EU how come we have so many Anti-EU MEP's?
pro	if the votr was tomorrow i would vote to leave, we are strong enough, and why shoukd we let brussels tell us what to do , thats why we fought 2 world wars, to stay a free nation , to control our own destiny, and our own borders, VOTE YES i will.
pro	if they reverse brexit London needs setting on fire.
anti	if they want to leave then why did they join in the first place
anti	if this pass, im moving to ireland
pro	if true, the Remain campaign are using dirty tricks to coerce you to stay. http://telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/12186850/Exclusive-David-Cameron-aide-complained-about-John-Longworth-to-British-Chambers-of-Commerce-hours-before-he-was-suspended.html #shame #brexit #eureferendum #gogogo
pro	if we fail due to sanctions it will be blamed on brexit and used as a pretext to justify the EU's existence.
anti	if we leave nothing will change, we will have to follow the same laws to trade with them
anti	if you are rich & can move assets it's bonanza time. The other 99% of the population are screwed
anti	if you really want a poorer and more irrelevant britain, then brexit is a good way to go.
anti	if you travel to Spain, Italy, Holland, France you'll be amazed of their agriculture power. UK sliced it's throat
pro	if you want to negotiate you need balls...i dont think she has any
anti	ignorant brexiters
pro	ill never taste of piece of bacon that tasted as good as this result.
pro	ime to get locked in to a fixed rate! I do didn't realise the EU sets our Base rate as well as everything else! Out
pro	in France a lot of French people admire the choice that anglettere made with brexit.
pro	in the EU we might be able to..., we could perhaps..., it may be possible to... Rubbish! It has never been possible - they only want our money, not our naturally conservative outlook. The show is run by Germany and to a lesser extent France and that is it. The EU is drivng away from what was a sensible economic co-operation model - the free market we voted to join, into a political project whose ultimate goal will be a federal EU, where member state parliaments are redundant and all decisions are made by people who are unaccountable. If we are forceed by the Remainers to stay in, it will be the Euro next and the EU Army, then taxes, the whole process will be accelerated as the EU hierarchy will feel they have an open door to do what they like. A significant reason why many voted Brexit in the UK was I'm sure to retain our fundamental rights of self-detemrination/sovereignty. And if the peoples of EU member states were allowed to vote, I have no doubt many of the nation states would vote the same way. France included.
anti	in the UK we currently enjoy the largest choice of products globally than any other country this maximises the end value to GDP contributions .Brexit will annihilate this. Soon we will only have Paprika flavoured crisps to choose from !!
pro	in the end the majority voted to leave, so I think we should leave.
anti	independence day for britain from what from them applying for EU membership and then retreating they are such a joke
pro	independence from germans colonization
anti	is my message to britan you are one of our most powerful members but if you leave we will maybe become much more powerless and maybe disolve so if you stay the eu will be more powerful so please stay
pro	isn't EU part of the UN , globalist control ???? I think UK should be independent , as before ,
anti	it has been kind of exhilarating to watch Britain partly realizing how incredibly dangerous and detrimental Brexit is going to be
pro	it is a very, very significant break and it plays into the president‚Äôs view that the world should be nations, free-market democracies and not globalist bureaucracies
pro	it is apparent that the eu wants to be much more than a trading bloc and that isn't what we voted to join
anti	it is at best pointless and fantastically expensive, and at worst disastrous for Britain politically, economically and socially.
anti	it is good to have Britain in the EU to counterbalance Germany and France. Besides it will cost my country a lot of money and economic damage when Britain leaves.
anti	it is not EU going down idiot , it is UK ..u must be blind not to see it
anti	it is up to the government to act responsibly and find a way to cancel Brexit. The vote was a result of ingnorant people being told lies by Farage Boris and the like and believing them. The farmers are a prime example. The NHS will be even worse off. and and .
anti	it is with grief and regret that I accept that we will leave the European Union on Friday. Oh no, here come the tears,
anti	it leads to mass unemployment.
pro	it means more patriotism, it means steps away from a dangerous NWO and the Bilderberg group. It means less rape in Britain. Nothing is going to happen to the EU migrants anyway.
anti	it seems like a massive screw-up from the politicians. You can blame the voters a bit too, but really, this should never have gone to a vote.
anti	"it sounds like a mess that they're going along with anyway because of the ""sunk cost"" thing. Really dumb."
anti	it sounds very stupid to leave the eu
anti	it turns out they are all batshit crazy. But it's funny how Scotland and Ireland voted against leaving. So you know whtat that means? Good bye UK
pro	it was the best idea ever, Britain has never been as united as now.
pro	it will be THE first to leave the e.u. but I bet it won't be THE last
anti	it will tear up international arrangements for trade, flow of capital and ease of travel and require endless fresh negotiations to re-establish anything like the access we have now.
pro	it would be difficult to consider Britain a democracy if the free and valid Brexit election was ignored or overturned. that's banana republic stuff.
pro	it's a clear choice between the short term economy and self-rule with belief in self-potential.
pro	it's about time the UK gets there independence
anti	it's almost as if leavers had absolutely no plan at all lmao
anti	it's an absolute shit show and we're looking like mugs! Very embarrassing
anti	it's an absolute shit show and we're looking like mugs! Very embarrassing!
pro	it's better than loosing our democracy to the EU
anti	it's going to buttfuck the UK. How can they not see that?
anti	it's like old story man seating on the branch and cutting it off but expecting the tree to fall down * Hmmm let's wait and watch see if the tree goes down or the branch with the idiot who started the Brexit for own gain
pro	it's not about immigration it's about being controlled by people who have no interest in this country whatsoever
anti	it's not democracy when the majority of people that voted don't understand what they voted for.
pro	it's not nationalism, fascism, racism or isolationism! It's democracy. The majority of British people voted to leave the European Union and their voices will be respected.
pro	it's our country we need to sort us out PRIORITY.
pro	it's simple normal people in Great Britain want Freedom, therefore didn't accept EU dictatorship !
pro	its about taking back our country and making our own laws, not by some unelected unaccountable idiot from Brussels that was not voted for by any of us
pro	its amazing how someone can say so much and say nothing at all, LEAVE MEANS LEAVE!
anti	its bad for their national economy and will have socio-economic effects on european union, as a Turkish person i think this is an opportunity for us to get closer with EU but probably not gonna happen with current political leaders
pro	its becuaes i want my countries identity back, I don't want to be controlled by some un elected muppet in Brussels.
pro	its easy. just go to a no deal
anti	its so funny and nuts and crazy and stupid that some people really think the uk got the upper hand .funny times
anti	it‚Äôs almost funny now we see all these videos explaining what brexit will mean AFTER the referendum. almost like no one really knew what they were voting for and believed the side of a bus....
anti	it‚Äôs easy to get lost in the labyrinth of the divorce process and lose sight of just how bad an idea Brexit is. It‚Äôs bad for the economy, the young and the unity of the UK.
anti	it‚Äôs so utterly depressing. Brexit the best example of mass manipulation of the ignorant (sorry if that offends, but there‚Äôs no other explanation) .
pro	i¬†never¬†voted for what the eu has become
anti	jobs will be lost as a result of brexit.
pro	just for curiosity. Why EU suppose accept back the UK? in one way or other they create just trouble in the EU.
anti	just get out become a new Zimbabwe
anti	just get rid of those incompetent politicians.
pro	just hard brexit and negotiate later
pro	just leave already and that is that
pro	just leave on 29th as previously agreed to. Your word is your bond, unless you were lying.
pro	just voted leave
anti	just wanted a peaceful year, maybe a holiday to Spain or Italy after my exams but not on Britain‚Äôs watch xxx
anti	keep up the good work. Brexit must be stopped. We here in main land EU despair at the failing UK politicians
pro	last week I was shopping and I saw a guy walking around with a blue jumper with yellow stars on it. I approached him and asked if he was British? and he said 'yes'. I said 'why are you wearing that shit EU flag? If you want to wear a jumper why not wear a Union Jack one? Don't you support your country'? I took my coat off and dropped it on the floor along with my shopping bags. He took his jumper off and said he was sorry. I think he realised he was 30 seconds away from getting his lights knocked out. As he walked away, I heard his wife say to him 'See, I told you not to wear that stupid thing'.
pro	leave it Britain! The EU is far corrupted like every other countries in this world
pro	leave means leave
pro	leave now, EU is a mess
anti	leave voters are narrow minded and thick
pro	leave won the referendum, with the biggest turnout of people old enough by uk law to vote ever in our history of voting , and i expect the government to deliver a complete break with the e.u! not the fake remainiacs brexit that they say is a good deal for us!!, i think its time to replace may with someone who will deliver a real brexit or face the onslaught at the next general election from 17.3 million or more now angry voters!! who knows maybe a new party will emerge soon who will deliver real brexit! the country is crying out for a third party who believe in real brexit as we will never get it from labour, conservative or liberal!!. the batman.
pro	leave, eu union parlement is full of corrupt
pro	leave.
pro	leavers won , get over it
pro	leaving the EU will be one of the best things ever to happen to this country. it wont be long before others follow when the block begins to collapes the cracks are already showing.
pro	leaving the EU would solve our actual problems.
anti	leaving the single most important union when it comes to peace and prosperity in Europe and not being very sure about each detail before doing it seems quite a temper tantrum.
pro	left loses again lol
anti	let britain leave with no deal, they need it to undertand what it means !
anti	let's see for how long those people will celebrate in UK
pro	lets face it the Eurocrats want us to stay owing to the fact that we pay ¬£350 million quid a week to belong to the EUssr. we could build and staff a few dozen hospitals for one years fees?
anti	lets see if the uk people can stay out the eu
anti	like a spoilt teenager eager to move out of mum n dads. Unawares of the true cost of living, too na√Øve to understand, but mainly too arrogant to care about the repercussions of their actions.
pro	lmao why people so pressed , like EU think they own UK , wtf?
anti	lmao! Racist xenophobic UK shooting themselves in the foot.
anti	lmmigration is what makes Britain, GREAT Britain. Britain's DlVERSITY is it's strength.
pro	lol EU can't even protect its own members from terror Attacks Good Riddens.
anti	lol the UK has been crap since the abolition of slavery and colonization. you should thank goodness for Europe.
anti	lol, that just proves my point really....the leave voters will believe anything, so long as it promotes their agenda..lol
pro	look up the word democracy, come into the chambers and apologise to the people of the uk. We voted leave and leave
anti	looks like I'm the only person in the whole comments voting to remain üòÇ
anti	losing so much. gaining nothing.
anti	love not leave
anti	lovely how England just made its citizens illegals in the EU they just lost all their benefits
pro	lower immigration, lower costs of living, less regulation, higher degree of global autonomy
pro	make Britain great again, and lets start with all the people that shouldn't be here, or are here and serve no purpose other than take take take, time to go home.
pro	make me easy... WTO. World is bigger than EU. Bring back British standards...
pro	makes you wonder why we liberated Europe from Hitler all of them in Europe are traitors next time a Hitler comes along don't come crying to the UK for help absolutely disgraceful no friend of us
pro	making an example of the UK, scaring the other members do they don't leave. Sounds like a great club
anti	many economists noted that consumer confidence looked fragile, and suggested that people were starting to worry that a hard Brexit would lead to job losses or hit house prices.
anti	meanwhile economic growth falls to 0.2% (lowest in g7) & many firms plan to move to ireland. brexit must be a success
pro	membership in the EU is treason against the crown.
anti	"message to the EU from Scotland "" We'll be back"""
anti	millions of people can't be wrong unless they're british
anti	more old white guys with an agenda. The UK is screwed, if you think it's bad now, you have no clue. It's about to get far worse. Next time Scotland has the chance it will go independent and go back to the EU
anti	most Brits are pretty stupid after all they have a crack head for Chancellor so they will vote yes to out and yes to 3 million jobs going they can always fall back on blaming immigrants for everything when it all goes tits up
anti	most inmigrants to UK are from Commomwealth of nations, not from middle east syrians. If European immigration policies are issued on Islamization of Britain it is a mistake, al Pakistan inmigrants to uk arrived thanks to Commonwealth not to EU.
pro	most of the other EU countries apart from UK don't even follow the rules and regulations of the EU anyway, even more reason to leave when we are getting so spanked by rules and regs that others don't even follow
anti	"most of the ppl that voted ""Leave"" were older ppl who probably won't be around in 20 years when we realize the full extent of the damage Brexit has caused the Britain ... the younger generation will have to pay the price of this stupid decision"
pro	most of us just want Brexit to be implemented and to get it done, and try our best to make it a success.
anti	move all the headquarters out of there, create high taxes for any trades and make their lives impossible so no other country wants to leave. Mess their economy and make them want to come back to the EU.sooner or later those that didn't want to leave will make noise and change things.Just go all game of thrones on them.
pro	must say, I feel immensely proud. To all those ( that‚Äôs you ) for digging in. Putting up with constant vitriolic attacks from the ‚Äòleft‚Äô. We stood firm, kept going, we achieved our aim. #brexit achieved against all attempts to thwart democracy. I applaud you all
anti	my assessment is Brexit is unlikely to deliver any economic gains
pro	my biggest problem with the eu is that its increasingly becoming more of a superstate backed by elitists such as the rothchilds and soros just take a look at the eu army take a look at all the times we tried to block a deal and failed to do so
pro	my elders told me they voted in to the EU. these are the same people who voted out in the masses just many years later. millennials blame the elders, but yet these elders are the ones with the best reason to do so for living through it
anti	my friends in Europe don‚Äôt make the stupid mistakes we made.
anti	my main problem is I don't trust the government. the eu helps take some power away from them, keeps the European human rights courts for us to go to and provides your average citizen with some recourse. we won't hate that without the eu. do you trust the government enough? I mean right now we had an education minister who didn't listen to headteachers, an environment minister who doesn't believe in climate change this isn't exactly a trust worthy government and i doubt those that follow will be much better.
anti	my problem is I have no faith in my compatriots to be willing to listen to long version of what the issues are
pro	nationalism is the only future. globalism is an anchor to hell.
pro	next should be a swexit
anti	nice move uk, you played yourself. now we sit back and watch their economy fall
anti	no deal is looking more and more beautiful 30% tariffs on everything from Europe
pro	no deal is the best deal! we voted leave we need to LEAVE. what may has agreed to is eternal servitude. britons never never never shall be slaves.
pro	no deal, good for farmers, butchers, local shops, community everyone
pro	no delay I want out asap we have waited long enough for these overpaid penpushers to do their job!
anti	no it isn't. Brexshit is like the sense of freedom you get absailing for the fist time without the support of a rope. For some reason I have never met anyone keen to try it twice...
pro	no more illegal EU backed regime change that resulted in the migrant crises. People died and lost their homes. Now UK will not participate in war crimes. Mass migration will not be necessary as people will have their homes.
pro	no one is worthy of leading all so no one should lead all. the brexit is progress for humanity. the eu is progress for certain segments of society. I choose humanity over society, you can keep your economic lies.
pro	no pain no gain
anti	no respect any more for the uk none whatsoever!
anti	no we wait for a fast secession between Scotland, ireland and north ireland , gibraltar included. Britain will be isolated soon and will lost 90% of companies and commerce with eu zone
pro	noboby wants to be within the EU anymore. I bet we the French will be the first to follow the Brits when they quit this bloody dictatorial union.
pro	nobody cares lol
pro	nobody in their right mind would believe we are about to start deporting people who live here
pro	none have impacted me directly, its more the impact on my society for example the EU common fisheries policy has severy damaged my countries fishing industry, the free movement of labour has also severly impacted the job and housing markets in my country making it harder to get employment that pays well and making it harder to get a house,
pro	not forgetting every doom and gloom story that has come out since brexit started hasn't come true I find it very difficult to believe what they're going to come out with
pro	not from england and i support england and agree for that move ..david comeron you are possy you should stand for your country mf and respect the england desire
anti	not often we get to watch a country like Britain burn itself to the ground.
pro	now I would vote in favour of Brexit. The reason is the way the EU has been so difficult in offering a beneficial deal to the UK on trade. I am a big free trader and I believe that there should be no restrictions on trade.
anti	"now is not the time to campaign to rejoin, but we must keep the dream alive, especially for young people, who are overwhelmingly #proEuropean,"""
pro	now let the exodus begin
pro	now merkel controls every aspect of british lives. so what was ww2 all about? vote leave, and make britain great again. canada and australia are doing a lot better than greece and spain.
pro	now start deportation of all those so called islamic refugees forced onto the UK by the eu.
anti	now that uk is the enemy we should destroy there economy.
pro	now we can start a new vision for our Great Country
pro	now we need to give Boris our support we don't need the EU
pro	oh !!!! Finally Britons have woke up !!! Cheers to Britons ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫ Congratulations !!!üòÄüòÄüòÄüëçüëçüëçüëèüëèüëèüëèüéµüé∂üé∂üé∂üç∏üç∏üç∏üç∏üéÜüéÜüéÜüéáüéá
anti	oh christ #r4today, you manage to interview the only person in public life in Ireland who thinks #brexit is a good idea You are a disgrace.
anti	oh noes, the anglo left the EU! the world is gonna end, oy vey!
pro	omg please France next!!
anti	once again, the youth of the UK lose out
anti	one good thing with this is the decades old blame on migrants for every problem in this island will now cease.
pro	one of the Greatest days of my life
anti	one of the most shocking and depressing days of my life
anti	one of the reasons I personally dislike it because it gives more power to our government; we have no constitution, Parliment can pass and repeal whatever they want. Between this, Theresa May's reclusiveness and the Home Secretary's attempts expand surveillance, I'm worried this country is moving into a more authoritarian direction.

(the EU have a list of regulations that every country in them has to adhere to)
pro	only a small mjaority want to stay.. both sides Left and Right want no deal!!!! dont listen to the scaremongering BBC. most of the country wants out!! OUT NOW!!
anti	ordinary UK customers don't know the real implications of Brexit. Consumers will pay the bill badly.
pro	our country our rules it is about time we take the running of our country back and what we voted for
anti	our voting system is broken
pro	out means out give them fook all .....im English not European.....
anti	outrageous. this will take away our choice about what to buy/eat based on where it comes from
anti	parasite farage is a disgrace, he tap into the weak and told them what to think and how to feel, and who to blame for their problems, people voted for a dream lace with lies and haft truth, i feel the UK will face a harsh reality
pro	pay tribute to the countless ordinary Britons who showed so much more wisdom than the self-serving political and financial elites that for too long have ignored their anxieties and aspirations
pro	peace is kept by nato; not the EU.
anti	people think they can step back in time. We'll have to see what a mess this is.
pro	people voting to stay in are traitors.¬† For the sake of democracy we need to regain control of our country and leave the Eu.
anti	people who vote leave have been lied too.. they probably don't even know the consequences.. uneducated people don't deserve to vote.
anti	people who vote leave have been lied too.. they probably don't even know the consequences.. uneducated people don't deserve to vote..
anti	personally i don't care that much, i think we should of stayed but i don't think it will all change as much as we think. it'll be fine.
anti	please admit it england can't live without Europe. England pull out of the EU that's the end for England
pro	please leave EU asap
pro	please vote to leave the EU.....this guy don't care about uk.
pro	please, please lets have another referendum so all the idiots who want a vote on the final 'deal' will at last find the majority of voters still want brexit.
anti	potential benefits of brexit: none.
pro	probably more the latter since alot of the laws are pretty minor (although for the economy needless bureaucracy can be really bad for minor buisnesses making it easy for large corps to crush small competition) but having a superior power makes my vote mean less and their are laws as i said my country cant change directly. not only that the EU is getting more and more centralised to the point where it wants to become a federal state much like the US or Germany i dont want to be in a nation with Europe we have conflicting goals values and principles and i am concerned because of the structure of the EU (the people who initiate votes for laws or the removal of laws arent elected by the people) the whole of europe could fall under a tyranical state.
pro	proud i voted for brexit :-)
anti	proud to have voted remain
pro	put the UK in charge of our own destiny and laws again
anti	really bad choice by England
anti	really hope its not gonna happen
anti	remain because I love going to the Netherlands.
pro	remain will be the end for the UK.¬† you remoaners need to get a grip
pro	remainers seem to believe that the whole of the Uk revolves around London. Look outside the box you muppets
pro	remoaners have been crushed so far
anti	respondents noted that even if a disorderly Brexit was averted, uncertainty over the UK‚Äôs future trading relations will limit the potential for a rebound, with the UK unlikely to return to pre-referendum levels of growth or to perform as well as its main trading partners.
anti	rexit makes me so sad
anti	sadly, the people will still prefer to hear the comforting lie over the uncomfortable truth. The UK becomes less important by the day
pro	screw eu and ur unity !
pro	screw the E.U. soon they will collapse and all that will be irellivant.
anti	self inflicted self harm DEAL with it leavers
anti	several respondents warned that Brexit brinkmanship was doing lasting damage to the economy, with the prolonged uncertainty leading businesses to take irreversible decisions.
anti	should of stayed in the eu smh
anti	skin crawls thinking of all the brexit celebration parties that‚Äôll be happening tonight. I imagine the hosts being the kinda people who will serve their guests tinned sardines and congealed prawn finger sandwiches. a compilation of boyzone and oasis covers plays in the background
pro	smart move, leaving this dying union.....
pro	sn't EU part of the UN , globalist control ???? I think UK should be independent , as before ,
anti	sn't it mad that we are literally living in a geographical and historical case study
anti	so now wishful thinking lies and guesses have to face the harsh economic realities of being outside the free trade area and now you are in big trouble as there are zero economic benefits as in now the only question is how big will the UK's decline be
anti	so scotland wants to be independent and then join the EU
anti	so the benefits of Brexit were nothing but lies and racism and in reality it brought nothing but trouble, which everyone remotely competent was able to clearly see coming. we really should've taken this as a warning sign.
pro	some corrupt MPs are trying to stop Brexit !
pro	some corrupt MPs are trying to stop Brexit !! üò®
anti	some leavers don't like facts i see. Let's be honest, the only plausible reason to leave the EU is because of the undemocratic way the EU operate, but at the same time has immigration been that much of an issue on the whole? Are foreigners to blame for all our problems? and did anyone on the leave side expect it to be a case of 'just leave, it'll be easy'. No. At the cost of our economy crashing, many innocents jobs in jeopardy, and the poorest and most vulnerable people being badly affected. All that doesn't matter i guess, so long as we leave the EU?
anti	some of the British still think that United Kingdom is still half the world sorry to tell u its only a dot on the map now and it hardly has anything to offer anyone in the world because we ain't the world anymore...
pro	sooner or later the EU bean counters are going to wonder from where they are going to find the billions that Blighty no longer pays into their Empire..............Germany and France will have to fill the gap as some of the other economies in their glorious Empire are tanking or on the brink
anti	sorry we haven't left yet. I think we should trust all the economic experts who know more about this than any of us. we will be worse off as a result of leaving. there is no evidence to suggest we will be better off. we shouldn't have left
pro	sovereignty¬†trumps all
anti	spin and misdirection Theresa May great performance: look busy whilst getting nothing done: stall stall and obfuscate.
pro	stay out of eu
anti	stay stay stay stay
pro	stay strong UK you will be free of the snakes of the EU soon!
pro	stay strong UK, you will be free of the snakes of the EU soon!
pro	stfu we had a vote and leave won. please honour the will of the people. you dont know best. we do not want to be part of this corrupt union anymore
anti	still waiting for Lord King to list 2 quantified benefits of leaving the EU
anti	stipid people vote stat stay stay stay stay
anti	stop brexit..satan wants to divide and rule
pro	surprising how Remainers call a non binding amendment a democratic vote and go on about referendum of 2016 being advisory .these people flip flop more than corybn
pro	t was a close run thing, no thanks to the Scots who now should leave the Union if they love the EU so dearly, As for Wales, shoulder to shoulder we stood on the day - Victory is ours!
anti	t will mean having to go through customs, like before. New trade agreements, new taxes, new limitations. New security. And a lot more costs to do so.
pro	t's a judgement call. Are you a lion who leads or a sheep who follows?
anti	t's sad what xenophobia did to the UK! The British people decided to lose their economy and social welfare to get rid of foreigners (This is what Brexit actually rmeans). This is Fascism!
pro	taly will follow UK soon ! bye bye Nazi UE
pro	ten years time we'll look back on these last three years and wonder what all the fuss and panic was about.
pro	thank god we have left this wretched institution. Look at the contempt they hold for our flag. We will make a success of brexit and be the envy of this stangnant, dead in the water, undemocratic empire.
pro	thank god we're leaving, we're off.
anti	thanks to Br-exit more than 100 company will move to Union European this year, one of them is Airbus based in Bristol Filton, in some financial company, will move to Germany France Spain etc...., actually we did a big favour to Europe, I‚Äôm aerospace Engineer and I was planning to move abroad to work in Sweden or Dubai, I applied yesterday for job the answer form to Company was, as a British I‚Äôm not allowed to work any more, because I‚Äôm not from European union, thank you My Country you cut off my wings
pro	that is nonsense. if they say the sky is brown people will be so stupid but to believe them. people wake up and smell the coffee. these corrupt establishment are working for this corrupt European union. they are simply trectrous independent. don't be fooled again. for Christ sakes.

pro	the EU has become a straight up crime against the people of europe.
pro	the EU has demonstrated that leaving the EU not possible without being bullied and harrassed into greeing to still be tied to the EU. Effectively staying in the EU.

pro	the EU is killing Europe
anti	the EU is more democratic than the UK
pro	the EU is nothing but a waste of taxpayers money. those bureaucrats have abused their position only to enrich themselves and their sponsors instead of looking out for european interests. im glad britain voted out and i hope the rest of will too.
pro	the EU is too old. all they are doing is slowing down the inevitable. leaving this union doesn't mean a new, more modern, one wont emerge.
pro	the EU is un elected oligarch ruling over Europe, no wonder Britain wants to leave
pro	the EU stinks
anti	the EU suffocates sovereignty and freedom? How backwards. I've lived in 3 different EU countries in my life, I feel free and I do not feel attached to one state only. There are European elections btw for those who say they do not have a right to vote. It's not right to criticise sitting on your arse at home when no one does his homework to find out about the rights given to him. Anyway, it is done. Do not come back crying.
pro	the EU, my government have ignored its own citizens for decades since joining. They have become fat and lazy because the EU makes most of the rules now

pro	the UK has its democracy back.
pro	the UK leadership is betraying its people by delaying Brexit and ignoring the people's vote to leave.
anti	the UK shot themselves in the foot for voting, not for a renegotiation of deals between the UK and Europe, but for an exit.
anti	the UK will go back where they came from before they joined the EU: The bottom of the pile financially. Good luck to them.
pro	the UK will not comply by EU standards on social protection or environmental regulations
pro	the UK will once more join the ranks of the other democratic nations of the world
anti	the UK's economy will collapse and the UK will fall apart
pro	the UK‚Äôs priority in the negotiations is to ensure that we restore our economic and political independence on 1 January 2021. That is the government‚Äôs primary objective. If asked to expand, we will ensure that we will have the right to regulate and are not constrained by EU law or the court of justice of the European Union
pro	the best thing that our country has done yet
pro	the best thing will be to get out of EU. the filthy propaganda of better in are all lies. u.k will be finished if it stays in. E.U is colapsing anyway
anti	the brexit is very bad for Great Britain. The economy of the brits has been degrading ever since the brexit and it will only get worse not better.
anti	the brexit will destroy the uk
pro	the chains are off we are free
anti	"the cost of Brexit equal the ""savings"" in contribution to the EU. Anyway the world economy as a system loses because there is no contribution to the EU and the UK economy is smaller. Everyone lose out."
pro	the costs of being in eu are not worth it
pro	the day after Brexit... will be the start of EU dissolution as other smart countries vote to leave one by one
anti	the day the country died
anti	the economical and political consequences for Britain will be significant ... The pro - Brexit are blind by their dogmatic and dangerous nationalism ...
pro	the eu can't push us around anymore
pro	the eu need us more than we need them
anti	the fall of UK start
pro	the germans have finally taken all other countries in europe under their control without a shot being fired.
anti	the goal should be one global union, brexit is a huge step back ... everybody involved will suffer...
pro	the goverment should hurry up and get on with brexit go we can get on mking great briton again!.
pro	the idea is that Britain will be more free and accountable
anti	the main mood of people is to stay in the EU. Their blinkered view will destroy the union as Scotland and Wales will leave, to remain. Those living in the past will get a massive shock, there will be anger,
anti	the momentum for staging a fresh independence referendum
pro	the more foreigners that leave the better.
pro	the nation will come out of it stronger, with new purpose, a renewed identity and ready to compete in the fast evolving 21st century.

pro	the people voted out, they never voted in.
anti	the pissing contest of migrants and non-migrants is false. The owners of business drive this trend. They don't care where you were born, they want to fuck the workers over for profit. we don't want these kind of people in business. Once they're squeezed out, it's remarkable how working for a decent boss/company changes your outlook on the world.
pro	the plan is: 1) Pretend a decent deal is impossible, (it isn't.) 2) Pretend that no deal is worse than a plague of boils. (it isn't.) and therefore, 3) Insist we have to stay in. (We don't want to.) The EU must think we're stupid if they expect us to swallow that nonsense. WTO in March is now the best deal. Then perhaps talk after the money tap is turned off.
anti	the problem is most of the people who are supporting the brexit don't know what they are doing
pro	the problem of people coming here and taking our jobs
pro	the reason I voted to leave what I call the EU(SSR) is because I see it surging towards a Globalist Super State, very nice for the wealthy political elite but not for the 'ordinary' citizen who's main function would be to pay for it
pro	the remain campaign literally has only even given hypothetical scare stories, they never bring up any positive benefits of being in it, I can't even list a good reason to stay
pro	the remainers and the BBC will still be wining and wringing there hands come monday
anti	the simple truth is britain will lose wealth without the EU
pro	the sooner we get rid of free movement off people and an laws imposed by the EU the better we will be
anti	the sun backs the leave campaign and you should know to always do the opposite of what the sun tells you #voteremain
pro	the supranational centralisation of power undermines British democracy
anti	the symbol of huge collapse
anti	the trouble with democracy is that everyone gets to vote...
pro	the uk leave success will set other european countrys free..it will help spread democracy to other countrys.
anti	the uk outside of europe will have no future place in big table politics ,there will be no inward investment and we will still trade with europe but will now be subject to Tariffs and Quotas .The only people who want us out are the Racists in our country who despise anyone who is not British sorry should have read ENGLISH . As for no room left did you know that more land in the UK is allocated to Golf courses than for House Building.
anti	the voters were deceived by lies into voting for Brexit, but the government doesn't see why they should have a revote with the lies exposed and the thousands signing the petition for a second vote, because apparently the people can't change their minds now the truth has been brought to light
pro	the way he's talking he could be one of the best PM we have ever had.
anti	the woman is in denial... she says the UK has had advantages as a member of the EU, so how can she think those advantages will remain when it is no longer in the EU??? this is the kind of thinking she and her think tank comes out with??? i for one think that Airbus will slowly move its factory to the EU...
anti	the worst decision made by UK in a long, long time
anti	the worst-case scenario‚Äîno future trade deal with the EU, no transition period at the end of March 2019, and a loss of trade agreements with non-EU countries‚ÄîGDP would fall by more than 10%.
pro	their are a large number of laws that i have to follow that where not implemented by my parliament or by one of my elected represetatives laws me and my countrymen cant change because it requires the votes of people from other nations. i cant speak for other people but that amounts to tyranny in my eyes, people in germany dont really care about people in the UK at least not in the same way that two people from the UK care about eachother and why would they i dont care about them we share a different culture and set of principles, i bare them no ill will but we shouldnt make decisions for eachother i dont want to lord over europe and i dont want europeans lording over me its as simple as that.
pro	then it‚Äôs out right war and I mean war on the streets we brexetiers will never except a vote to remain in the Mafia EU
pro	there are benefits of Brexit such as reducing immigration and the ability to not be subjected to unnecessary and bureaucratic regulations/laws made by a supranational body of which some elements are unelected/undemocratic.
anti	there are so may things wrong with brexit that i would even know where to begin...
anti	there is no version of Brexit that is better than what we currently have. None. People will be poorer with all versions of Brexit.
pro	there is only one solution, to become AUTONOMOUS
pro	there's a lot of spin out there, it's difficult to sift through. I'm not worried about leaving... The EU is falling apart and we're on the edge of a world reccession. Better to get a head start.
anti	these british people always have their own heads, always so egoistic and thinking they are superior to anyone else
anti	these leavers are ignorant pigs.
pro	they are all limited by EU tariffs etc. So not good enough. Plus they steal our money via our subsidy.
anti	they are gonna regret this stupid emotional decision. too much emotions were triggered.
pro	they did well ....... europe is a prostitute
anti	they didn't give a flying fish about the way they ruined UK fishing &amp; put hundreds out of work; so why the hell should we give
pro	they don't live in an area where, locals have been pushed out of the work place
pro	they forgot that people see how the rest of the world is doing outside of the eu and the true brits wanted to be part of that not bogged down in an eu system that is undemocratic corrupt and seen to be failing
pro	they should do so the sooner the better. There is no need for a burden to the further European integration
pro	they should leave so we and the rest of the EU can finally work on our European superstate without disturbing party poopers. They have slowdown the european integration long enough.
pro	"they still don't get it. We haven't lost Europe We REJECTED EU. We love Europe. Actually, the title should be ""how EU lost Europe"". many countries are unrecognisable due to uncontrolled high immigration."
pro	they turned leave or dont leave into deal or no deal. we voted leave. THEY want a deal.
anti	they'll regret it very soon. sadly
pro	things were perfectly fine before they joined the EU and it will be perfectly fine after they aren‚Äôt part of the EU.
anti	think the British should be thankfull to the EU. Their own government is so useless, they can't agree upon anything.
pro	think we can allow ourselves a couple of days to feel triumphant. After that, back to work with a vengeance, knowing we are working for ourselves. As for the bill for ¬£1.9 billion, marked 2019-2020, surely we only need to pay a twelfth of that? We aren't going to be there for the other eleven months, we don't pay rent on an empty house?
anti	this brexit thing is totally a mess ‚Äì what a disaster for both parties!
anti	this could be the worst thing ever of all time
anti	this does not look like a good deal... considerably worse than being a member... i wonder if we got it wrong....
anti	this is a grass is greener effect. it never works. does it?
anti	this is fucking depressing two years later
anti	this is one of the worse days for the uk! This is not independence day
anti	this is so said... and I truly hope that our kids can fix it again what we have missed to address properly. We should quickly allow to define a mode of working together with focus on the youth and future generations. The challenge is not a border or the EU, the challenge is how do we all survive facing radical environmental changes. I love the spirit of the EU and I love the UK.
pro	this is the best possible thing to happen. no more of the big banks and controlling politicians. this video is biases and don't believe whay you hear. down with big government
pro	this traitorous cow is not doing what the people voted for it was remain or out never mentioned was to strike a deal she obviously isn't doing what the people voted for democracy in this country is dead
pro	this was the best tv I've watched for a long time. I watched this live throughout the night. also I voted for Britain to leave the EU.
anti	this whole vote has been a smeeringcampaign againt the eu
anti	this will be disaster for common people
pro	those filthy EUers wanting to make deals, giving 'good' advices.. haha, fools without arguments, I hope every country will get out of it
anti	three years later and you kinda watch how britain's setting itself on fire
anti	to all brexiteers my view from outside, from germany: stop dreaming of the mighty old empire. stop hating immigrants. be decent. not as obscene, vulgar, xenophobic and outlandish as you appear now. get real. a new referendum would be nice :)
pro	to bad for the muslims the EU has been shoving down the throats of the people of Britain
anti	to break up the EU it may have to be the breakup of the UK. This is the ultimate price british voters paid with the referendum
pro	too late for tears mrs EU!! Be nice to your members next time!!
anti	tragedy. A contemptible tragedy. I hope the people who voted for Brexit are happy. At least someone will be.
anti	udged by AEP prophecies in the past about the demise of the ‚Ç¨ the European Union will enjoy a brilliant future in contrast to Little England.
pro	umm johnson hasn't been in power for 3-years. if anything remainers had been and were doing anything to stop brexit and the people could clearly see that.
anti	unfortunately people in the UK know a little about history and economy. They will vote as they feel right now....Ohh lets move the Poles out of here....Lets do nothing and drink Stella Artois day after day. Government will pay for us and our children. We don't have to work as we are British. The elite blood... Joke British people would starve to death if immigrants wouldn't work for them.... GOOD LUCK. I can't wait to see those British retards pushing UK's economy them self...can't wait
pro	unions need the membership money from all the EU workers, also are we that incapable of implementing our own laws
pro	united Europe is not a dream, its a nightmare. if Europe stays together it will eventually become like the United states, where all states become second to a federal government, that does what the huge corporations want and the states will eventually start to deteriorate, that is what is happening in the USA.In the USA the 1% of the rich now have 40% of all the wealth, while the remaining 99% have 60%, that is an increase of about 120% for the rich, in about the last 20 or so years, and that is steadily becoming more out of balance. When the rich can easily manipulate the population, through bought politics, it isn't going to benefit anyone but them, that is why the rich are working to unite the world, so that they can easily manipulate it.
anti	ur moms gonna brexit
anti	urge everyone that wants to stay in the EU to go and vote on the 23rd! Every vote counts! Think about the future!
anti	ust cried a little at work whilst asking a colleague what passport they held. I‚Äôm having to make lists of EU citizens and it‚Äôs the most hateful task. We are making lists. For the government. I understand how Germans got sucked into the machine in the 1930s. #brexit
anti	ust forget about brexit. Most of us want to stay but the stupid UK government is blindly determined to drive us all off a cliff to honour an old decision by an ill-informed public that should never have been theirs to make in the first place.
pro	ust to clarify my perspective, some of you have interpretted my comment and come to the conclusion that the reason i wanted to leave the EU was so that we could become some deregulated wild west, where my actual belief is that the people who are most capable of putting in place effective legislation in the UK is the UK government,t
anti	very sad .. UK can not stand on his own.....apparently , British, you need France-Germany to survive...where is the famous British pride ....where are the famous WW2 British soldiers ...very sad.....you can not manage alone..for God sake
pro	very wise decision by Britain people well done...the country belongs to the people and not the government
anti	virtually all the polls show that the UK electorate¬†wants to remain in the EU, and has wanted to remain since referendum day
pro	"vote LEAVE. it's obvious. if any Brit has any doubts, just search youtube for ""The Truth About #Brexit"" by Paul Joseph Watson, and ""The Moment of Truth"" by Pat Condell. Make Britain Great again."
pro	vote leave take back your country
anti	voted for Brexit but now realise I was lied to and listening to LBC James O Brain in particular who convinced me of the Madness of Brexit and I mean madness .So yeah I have changed my mind and wish to have the right of redress on the lies I was told by Farage

pro	we want a hard brexit. No deal with the EU what so ever. No shengen area, no trade rules with the EU. and the UK returns to being part of the global economy, with fair trade deals with the entire rest of the world, Free to decide it's own regulations, which may or may not be in line with the EU, but it will be up to the UK, Not the EU, what any policies are for the UK
pro	we want to reclaim the right to elect our rulers and dismiss them if they betray our trust
pro	we were conned into joining EU by John Major we elected to join the Common Market

anti	what if instead of doing a brexit we just spent an evening petting a cat that we knew and telling it how much we appreciate it and you are a sweet kitty.
anti	what imbecile brexiters will not understand in their pea size brain is this government nor the opposition has voted for brexit nor wanted one, how ever this is what they ended up with, so to deal with this break up was long and painful as they had no plans for such event
anti	what imbecile brexiters will not understand in their pea size brain is this government nor the opposition has voted for brexit nor wanted one, how ever this is what they ended up with, so to deal with this break up was long and painful as they had no plans for such event, now they are crying about the results well when you voted for brexit you had voted with a pea size brain you had no concept what you are voting for and end result, because you had a pea size brain you never wondered what the end result with this would be nor you cared, so why the care now...?? i for one as the other side of this argument just laugh at these brexiters with my butthole they have no reason to blame the government if they want to blame some one blame the rats who run the brexit campaign and who run it plus yourself for not being able to question before voting, as usually am i asking for too much from a pea brains..??? if you ask me i want hard brexit so that it might hurt so much their pea size brain might expand to a bigger pea...

AND the 1975 vote had an over 64% turnout compared to the pitiful turnout for brexit. so it‚Äôs time for the brexiters to shut up! the majority of this country voted to STAY IN if they‚Äôre so sure they‚Äôre right, then let us hold A THIRD REFERENDUM to decide the issue once and for all
anti	why dont you brits lets scotish leave uk or northern ireland? maybe the scotish also dont want their laws made in london or their oil money sucked by london... come on dont be fascist, let these ppl rule themselves not by some british ppl they did not elect!!!

pro	why worry UK is out in a few weeks so the EU can do its own stuff....greeks/spain/italy in perma recession and yellow shirts stampeding across EU so we know EU will do even better w/o the UK handouts and access to UK markets:)...if EU wants to close airspace to UK airplanes then dont worry b/c the EU will be too poor to fly to the USA anyways with UK airspace closed to EU craft

anti	wtf is wrong with you people in the comment section? blaming the single most powerful political and economic project since the formation of the US for your ingraines racism, xenofobia and hatred is ridiculous. the EU helped raise my country from a thirld to a second world country in less than 10 years and it has kept Europe toghether for the last 40 years (+/-) it kept peace and allowed us to travel freely and blend our separate cultures and be closer toghether, it safeguarded many workers' rights, set in place standars for the economy & many industries DAMN it do you know why we DON'T eat the garbage that most amercians eat (posonous stuff)? it's because of the EU (mostly) most sane people i know embrace the ideea of a federalised Europe, and want a single market economy like the US i never knew how stupid scaremongoring could get untill i saw some of the leave campaign bullshit and i do hope that britain will get sorely taxed for its stupidity and shady cross-oceanic planned policies oh and we want to keep Scotland only downside i see is that if i ever wanna visit there i might not be able to do you know how bothersome it is to get a visa? anyway
pro	yeah project fear, they said similar things when we didn't join the single currency, funny enough project fear never happened
pro	yeah, THE REALITY OF BEING FREE OF THE EU

anti	yes the EU has tons of problems, what doesn't? nothing is perfect, especially where there's power, lots of people with rotten intentions are gonna hop in. still, it has brought many good things to people who travel and do business across european countires but i guess the people who never left their hometown dont know about that so to them the eu is just bad.
pro	yesss, good for your Britain

anti	you are not Gandalf my friend.....Brexit is bad PERIOD.
pro	you are not giving us what we voted for you joke there was no place for your so-called deal you are not giving us what we voted for at all you clown
pro	you brits should see this as a good thing. your leader just dealt a very swift blow to the global eletists that want nothing more than to gain 100% control and usher in the new world order. my America should take a look at this and learn a valuable lesson. we should cut all ties with these global elites too. they are a virus, a disease that will slowly destroy entire countries from the inside out.
anti	you do realise the people who want to leave want to scrap the NHS. also food will be more expensive as we get a lot from the EU. wants wrong with immigrants?
pro	you forgot that eu is ruled by people NOT elected by citizens of eu and they still have the power to rule and change laws. The countries in eu loses their democracy. EU is a dictatorship
anti	you forgot to mention that the brexit will reduce the freedom of movement, defence and do business with the excuse of liberty.
anti	you forgot to mention that the brexit will reduce the freedom of movement, defence and do business with the excuse of liberty. And that brexit will move the power from an all-elected Brussel (where Farange could get a salary) to a monarchy with litterally lords by using the slogan: take back control from unelected burocrats.... They said that to finance the NHS, you need to give up internationally financed cancer research programs..
pro	you must be a fool if you believe that left wing propaganda, I new the facts, voted to leave.
anti	you need immigrants because you didnt make babies but want your pension. someone has to do the work, because you dont want to go back working on the farms. now after leaving the eu, make a legislation that lets employed immigrants stay and unemployed have to go home. problem solved
pro	you sir are a fucking idiot! If you dont like the outcome of the vote id pack up and emigrate :)
anti	you will go down like the titanic
anti	you will wake up soon an realise, you‚Äôve made a massive mistake. Trust me. It‚Äôll take some time but you‚Äôll come around
anti	¬£40 billion divorce bill, open borders, Eu regulations, annual payment for customs union.. yay, finally we're nearly out! Not quite the Utopia Farridge and BJ sold everyone.. let's stop this complete waste of time and money, stay in the EU where we at least have a say in what goes on, and get on with our lives which were perfectly fine before Cameron started all this nonsense!
pro	"‚ÄòDelaying or cancelling Brexit would be a ""calamitous"" breach of trust with the electorate‚Äô The death of democracy? 1 vote, 1 result ‚Äì the majority who turned out voted Leave Make sure we do."
pro	‚ÄôSoft-Brexit‚Äô is simply ‚ÄôNot-Brexit‚Äô, an attempt to undo, as much as possible, the referendum result and keep us as close to the status-quo as possible.
pro	‚Äôm a 23-year-old nursing student. We have a chance to take this country in a progressive direction. Leaving the EU does not mean we have to become a rightwing reactionary country. British values are what the people want them to be. I think that all Brits will unite against the racist rhetoric that has dominated this referendum. I think they will deny Boris, Farage or even Osborne the chance to become prime minister as they know they can‚Äôt be trusted to lead a post-Brexit Britain. We have to stand up, shout and protest for a general election. If this is a new era for Britain, the British public should have the chance to decide what direction we take.
anti	‚ÄúApplicants must have the unrestricted right to live and work in the EU.‚Äù British only nationality not good enough.
anti	‚ÄúGreat national drama‚Äù really says a lot about the worldview of the upper class Tory politicians. It‚Äôs all a fun game to them.
pro	‚ÄúHow Britain lost Europe‚Äù? Britain didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlose‚Äù Europe. Britain VOTED to leave it. No wonder ppl hate the media and call it fake news. It doesn‚Äôt represent what voters want, it represents what the elites want.
anti	‚ÄúI have a cunning plan‚Äù declares novice sailor Baldrick, aka @BorisJohnson as he signs the log book and takes the good ship HMS Blighty out into the north Atlantic, searching for an iceberg.
anti	‚ÄúNew things to come‚Äù Coronavirus has entered the chat.
anti	‚ÄúStop whinging and accept what‚Äôs happening!‚Äù say Brexiters who spent 47 years whinging and not acccepting what‚Äôs happened.
pro	‚ÄúThe majority believe that Brexit is more important, and would back Brexit even if this led to the future breakup of the UK‚Äù.‚Äù
pro	‚ÄúWe just want to be out of the EU because that‚Äôs what people voted for‚Äù
anti	‚Äúdon‚Äôt fix something that isn‚Äôt broken‚Äù
anti	‚Äúleaving the EU‚Äù is a mistake for certain and first and foremost in¬†how¬†it is being executed. This way it cannot be but a failure.
pro	‚Äúwe have made our choice‚Äù
pro	‚ÄùFake news! UK will prosper as soon as Bojo signes that fantastic America first trade deal.‚Äù
pro	üá¨üáß Hard Brexit all the way üá¨üáß
anti	"üòÜ it's funny, when the brits sees the raise in taxes for the commercial negotiations they will want to be back to EU or begin piracy endeavours as they always did before the ww2. they feel really ""independent"" but the only reason they did this is because papa USA allow this."
anti	ü§£ü§£ imagine that bulgarian and romanian passport will be better than british passport ü§≠ü§≠
