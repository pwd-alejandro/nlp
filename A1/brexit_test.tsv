anti	"I had to trigger Article 50. It would have been too embarrassing otherwise. ""So you're going to leave the EU... out of embarrassment?"""
anti	Uh we want to leave the EU but we want to keep all the benefits
pro	#DeathtotheEU oh wow I really hate the #EU What a bunch of arrogant condescending jerks. I'm so happy #Brexit is now in the rear view mirror.
pro	#IVotedLeave and I hope you did too! #EUref let's take back control and make tomorrow our independence day!
pro	#IVotedLeave for the love of democracy and to ensure a Britain in control of its destiny is free to save Europe.
anti	#LiarJohnson doesn’t want to refer to the “controversy” by its name any longer. I have news for you @BorisJohnson. You’re deluded if you think for one second that we won’t hold you and your #Brexit catastrophe to account, constantly, until it is reversed. #ReleaseTheRussiaReport.
anti	(I’m from Scotland btw) I wished we wouldn’t leave the EU😭
anti	(I’m from Scotland btw) I wished we wouldn’t leave the EU😭 Bc in my opinion both sides will be suffering especially the Uk 🇬🇧 The votes were so close aswell.
anti	30 years from now. They would want to be back in.
pro	40+ years to get out? Disgusting bureaucrats!
pro	85% of British voters voted for a pro brexit party this election. This means that they obviously do not regret their vote to leave in 2016.
anti	A Brexit Britain that will navigate its way in the world without a moral compass.
pro	A European 'Community' of sovereign states is possible without the 'Political Union' that is the EU. You know, like what occurred from the dawn of Europe up until the mid 20th century.
anti	A Tory mess from the very beginning. So depressing and sad.
pro	A barbaric Islamic immigrant invasion is the real reason we voted to Leave.
pro	A deal isn't Brexit.
anti	A huge win for Putin and low browed racists!
pro	A lot of older people voted for Brexit. This is because they've witnessed the EU 'develop' in its entirety, from a seemingly innocent trading bloc in the '70s, to a sinister federalisation project, with control freakery & anti-British policies, by 2016 (the time of the referendum). For over 40 years they had no say in this, then finally, they were given a chance to speak ... and they said 'Leave.'
pro	A lot of these people claiming a disaster awaits are the same ones who were saying what a disaster it would be for the UK to not join the Euro. They were wrong. Freedom is ALWAYS worth the price and better in the end. It's time for the UK to take control back from the unelected EU bureaucrats.
pro	A no deal LEAVE means freedom and joy!
pro	A revolution is just what this country needed, now let us all join together and put the Great back into Britain.
anti	A sad day for Britain...
anti	A sham. We left the EU in control of our armed forces and intelligence services. Why does no one mention that !.
anti	A spooky and dark fate wait for you UK
pro	A vote to stay in the EU is a vote to stay a slave.
anti	About 56% x 47million = 26 million want to Remain now they know the truth about Brexit. It would be a democratic travesty if an outdated and fraudulent referendum, on a policy which will only do harm to the UK, were implemented.
pro	About bloody time we took a leaf out of the Australian book.
anti	Actually nobody was knowing what exactly brexit is, now they all came know that it is a politics and nothing is in favour of a public.
anti	After #brexit, when rapper 50 cent performs in GBR he'll appear as 10.000 pounds.
anti	"After Brexit the British public will soon realise that all this nonsense about Brussels' diktats is just what it is: nonsense. Today's economy is international. The markets decide, not governments. Therefore ""Take back control"" is just an utterly hollow phrase, used by and aimed at people who do not know how trade functions. Brexit will harm the British economy irreparably."
pro	After leaving EU, Johnson's government seems that it will get closer with other countries and deal with concerns more...and see the things more clear..
pro	After many conversations good + bad (+sad) I feel retainers are as bad to uk as trump is to usa hun :( I'm at a loss to why people Don't believe that Great Britain can be Great without the Eu
anti	Ahh and now the UK needs to negotiate trade deals with every country :) Good luck negotiating with trump, I hear he is the best negotiator xD will probably end in another trade war :P
anti	All Brexitiers overlocked the results. This may end in war in Irland and the end of the UK and many many people will lost there jobs
pro	All racists and xenophobics voted leave but not all people that voted leave were racist and xenophobic.
anti	All the solutions piss off someone somewhere... A sad state of affairs :(
pro	All this scaremongering about no deal is starting to wear thin, we don’t need the EU for imports alternatives can found around the rest of the world and may make people actually buy British.
pro	All this scaremongering has made me realise my remain vote was the wrong choice and I'll vote leave given a second chance as these pro EU politicians are clearly up to no good inventing such nonsense.
anti	All we can do, is watch this country go down.
anti	Alot of my friends who have settled in uk from mainland Europe are looking at moving back to their homeland because of Brexit. A GP, paediatric nurse, homeless outreach workers, support workers, and carers among them. The only good thing is that we'll have plenty of places to go on holiday!
pro	America is with you Great Britain! Leave means leave.
anti	An Englishman, a Scotsman and an Irishman walk into a bar.The Englishman wanted to go so they all had to leave.
anti	And it came to pass that the British people would see the beginning of the biggest mistake their government is to inflict on them. Broken promises already? Who suggested Johnson was different to trump in that respect? There will be worse to come.
anti	And now, fellow Europeans, let's witness the fall of an empire
pro	And so the Titanic set sale with all its bluster whilst wise passenger UK jumped off at the last minute.
anti	Another country destroyed by conservatives, cool.
anti	Another deluded Brexiteer!
pro	Another post full to the brim with hard facts. Oh wait its another post full of rhetoric to paint brexit in a negavtive light
anti	Another referendum may be divisive, but to press on with Brexit would be even more so.
pro	Any exit from the maze is a good thing in my opinion.
anti	Any sensible business person whose company does cross-border trade will tell you that leaving the EU would equal economic suicide.
anti	Anyone who likes to sit by and watch the world burn... it's the perfect thing! It's the biggest political mess in living memory.
pro	Anyone would think that the UK was a space land desolate piece of rock before we joined the EU. I think it's perfectly reasonable to want to have the autonomy to have our laws dictated and constructed by ourselves without the totalitarianism of a centralised corrupt government that is the EU. Besides, we will still be 'European'
pro	Are the British people intelligent enough to make a serious decision? If you think Yes... Then you you need to respect their choice... If you think no, There really is little point in asking them to vote again.
pro	As a American we brexited in 1776 an it was pretty cool
anti	As a pro-EU Briton I'll never forget the hopelessness I felt when I woke up on the morning of 24th June 2016. However I took warmth from the fact that almost 80% of young Britons want to remain in the EU while more than 80% of old people want to leave it. By the time we leave in 3 years time, most British people may want to remain. In 10-20 years time, I expect there will be calls to rejoin and I look forward to one day being a part of the EU again.
anti	As a staunch Remainer I was very touched by this. Alas May is in full autopilot and is determined to drive this train over the cliffs. She won’t even read anything contrary to her fabrication that the majority want it.
anti	As an EU student applying to UK universities this year, please Britain! Don't leave us 😭
pro	As an european I can honestly say Brexit is great. I'm having the time of my life :)
anti	As anti-brexit I am, I really hope I'm wrong and that brexit actually improves Britain.
anti	"As best I can figure from the conversations I've had with my dad (he was pro-Brexit, I was anti), his concern was not so much any concrete tangible positive thing to be gained, so much as a hypothetical future negative thing to be avoided. I don't think he ever named a specific EU policy decision that he disagreed with (except possibly for the way the debt crisis in Greece was handled, which... fair enough, that was a shitshow), but was very concerned that decision-making be accountable and local. Meaning ""within the UK"", not at a supranational level. Lot of dislike for the mythical ""federal superstate"" that is apparently inevitable. I guess I can see an argument that powerful bodies have an awkward tendency to become captured by corrupt interests and stop truly answering to the people; so it's best not to let them be too big/powerful in the first place. But to be frank I think he actually just has a prejudicial distrust of the French and Germans. Oh and of course also the hoary old ""immigration => pressure on public services and infrastructure"" (never mind that migrants collectively pay more in tax than they consume in spending, or that the real problem is chronic underfunding)"
anti	As brit, I want to join the EU army, especially while drumpf is in power. Where can I sign up?
anti	As someone who did not get to vote, it really irks me that generations like mine will have to live with decisions made without us. I would have liked to consider studying and living abroad freely without all this hassle. I might be ignorant of the nitty gritty, but people seem to be fuelled mostly by opinion and conjecture anyway. Maybe I’m just uncomfortable with change... but so much seems ambiguous now.
anti	As they said it's very easy to leave the EU, but what you will do after is the difficult part.
anti	Ashamed of being British
pro	At least Britian didn't have to fight a whole Revolutionary War to gain their independence.
pro	At this moment. Leave the EU without a deal in March 2019. UK GOV PETITION 186781 signatures Stop Brexit 68400 signatures SAYS IT ALL LEAVE MEANS LEAVE
anti	Avoid a period of economic uncertainty which is almost certainly going to occur after a leave vote. How long? at least 2 years under the Lisbon Treaty, but it could be longer. This period makes the UK seem like a gamble (high-risk, high/low gain venture) to investors and companies, where they are unlikely to be attracted.
anti	BOLLOCKS TO BREXIT !
pro	BREXIT ALL THE WAY!
anti	BREXIT BAD!
pro	BREXIT is the only sane answer for us we are a very small Island and its getting overcrowded now ok.
anti	BREXIT, bluffing method gone wrong
pro	BREXIT, didn’t happen because of bad feelings, it happened because we believe in accountability, AKA Democracy
pro	BRITAIN IS CLEVER VIVA BREXIT ! DOWN WITH GRAND NEW COMINTERNA - EU !!
anti	Because of global technology, economy and problems, we need global cooperation and coordination. Local chauvinism is NEVER an acceptable response!
anti	Because of the blind patriotism of some old ignorant bastards, millions of young people will be robed of opportunity of living and work in a different different country. I hope Scotland leaves for good now! Did the 'out people' thought about the impact this exist will have on people?? How many lives will it destroy?
anti	Beginning of the end
anti	Best of luck England. Commiserations to Scotland and Northern Ireland for being dragged out against your will. I hope it all works out but I doubt there will be any benefits to this for the current generation. It was an emotional, nationalist vote, with complete disregard for the potential economic damage that will most certainly come in the short to medium term.
pro	Best political day of my life.
pro	Best prime minister of UK, of all times, Boris jonhson
pro	Best thing about #Brexit ? Watching #Remain implode. #HappyBrexitDay
pro	Best thing the uk ever did was to vote for brexit, there's not much to gain to be part of the eu, not compared against the costs
anti	Better start for digging deep in your pockets or perhaps dosh out for a non UK passport too. Thanks for screwing up the free rights of speech for the next few generations. Wow! And we pay these ......
pro	Biased af. Brits are right on Brexit.
anti	Biggest mistake in history
pro	Bilderberg Group founded the EU to be the the One World Odour and rule over Europe You would only be a vassal state if you are a member you cannot RUN YOUR OWN COUNTRY and your BORDERS will be DISSOLVED
pro	Bond films to last 30% longer with scenes of his passport being more heavily scrutinised between exotic European locales.
pro	Border control to exclude EU rapists, criminals, people who propound religious hate -and the power to deport them - is also reasonable. What Remainers still fail to understand is that most Brexiteers didn't support excluding foreign doctors - or hard working Polish builders.
anti	"Borders....what's up with that? As a Canadian I have a hard time grasping ""No Immigrants Allowed"" (even though there are a lot of Canadians who apparently feel this way too) Then again Canada is only 150 years old so pretty much everyone is either an Immigrant or a child of one."
anti	Boris Johnson and all leavers are about to find out the bitter taste of imaginary freedom! Let the blame the EU game begin/continue! Although this time, the EU won't care anymore. Britain is a third country now, no more favors or concessions.
anti	Boris Johnson has no plan at all, from what I can see, other than beating his chest and braying absurdities, to appeal to the Brexit mob.... it's all so utterly dreadful.
pro	Boris Johnson, the UK has saved Europe from German tyranny again ! Frexit, Italexit, Grexit will follow !
anti	Boris Johnson: Capitulates to the EU's demands on the withdrawal agreement and spins it as a victory
pro	Boris and Nigel are the most respectful pimps ever.. Hope they can save the holy country of England. 🇳🇱 Much love from Holland 🧡🦁
pro	Boris: 'stand up for democracy and #VoteLeave' We can #TakeBackControl in 2 days time #LetsDoThis
pro	Bravo Nigel Farage
pro	Breaking the European shackles - the only reason for our poor run of form - for a 3-2 victory in celebration of our independence. #probrexit #provictory
anti	Brexit - so f'ing stupid you couldn't sell it as a work of fiction.
anti	Brexit = imperialist nostalgia
pro	Brexit best for UK
anti	Brexit biggest scam
anti	Brexit fans deserve this. UK's economy will crash again. Brexit fans will cry & I'll laugh.
anti	Brexit feels like Donald Trump, a failed experiment for change.
anti	Brexit fools. If the UK leaves the EU the FIRST thing that will happen is that the UK will lose its influence as a financial centre. You think countries that trade in the Euro, want a foreign country that doesn't trade in the Euro as their financial centre? For years they have been trying to get the European financial centre in Paris or Berlin.
anti	Brexit gives me bruxism People in Britain called the emergency services when KFC had a chicken shortage. Wtf do people in Britain know?
pro	Brexit good for England people
anti	Brexit happens and we've already declared war on Italy by the looks of things
anti	Brexit has been a strain on all of us. In some ways it has paralysed us.
anti	Brexit has been one long lesson in why a trade bloc is powerful, why regulations are a good thing, why customs unions are useful, why free trade has to be negotiated, why globalization needs regulation, why the UK is not a super power, why unions have power, why peace treaties are difficult, why manufacturing is international, etc
anti	Brexit has come, let Bregret begin.
anti	Brexit has just been one giant cluster fuck of mob stupidity. It's frankly embarrassing. (Sorry European neighbours, some of us tried to stop it happening)
pro	Brexit has really broken a taboo. The Brits have shown us that you can leave the European Union, and you can come out better.
anti	Brexit is a disaster and they're not interested in making one concession just because the balloons in parliament voted for a change. The UK is irrelevant, they're are not interested. I hope the brexit voters work at the Nissan plant!! And for those that work there and voted to remain I'm truly sorry for you.
anti	Brexit is a disaster. Stay in the union.
anti	Brexit is a huge mistake, a way for the UK to cover up its disastrous voting record on putting total idiots into government. No single trade deal outside the EU exists, no trade deal has been negotiated since. brexit is the failure of the UK finally cutting itself off from the rest of the world. The UK government admitted today is does not have a single measure in place.
anti	Brexit is a load of shite.
anti	Brexit is a mistake of historic proportions.
anti	Brexit is a national embarrassment
pro	Brexit is a right decision. EU is sick now.
anti	Brexit is a shitshow... Terrible from beginning to end.
anti	Brexit is a slow motion car crash
anti	Brexit is a tiring mess.
anti	Brexit is a total sham. Organised by charlatans.
anti	Brexit is a worse decision than Trump. We can impeach Trump. Brexit will make the UK irrelevant.
anti	Brexit is all about free trade until it isn't... Proof that brexit supporters are #thick
anti	Brexit is because Brits consider themselves superior to the rest of Europe and therefore UK doesn't need EU, and doesn't trust EU. I hope they will face the reality soon!
anti	Brexit is bonkers.
pro	Brexit is great for the UK full stop.
pro	Brexit is great now they need to stick with it and break up the United Kingdoms.
anti	Brexit is insane
anti	Brexit is just a proof that British are stupid because of the education system for example I finished school with no history the ones who did still don’t know what is the European Union
anti	Brexit is just another excuse the Oligarchs on Wall Street will use to screw over the working & middle class.
anti	Brexit is like Nazi-Germany
anti	Brexit is like having to scrape together a huge amount of money, which we can ill afford, in order to buy a new apartment. Only to discover that the new apartment is actually just the old apartment. Except now, we are not allowed to sit on the resident’s committee.
pro	Brexit is like the sun coming out from behind the clouds. The UK will be able to make its own laws and put its own people first. We have been incredibly generous to Europe and remember we are becoming anti eu not anti European. We need to look after our own now if you dissagree perhaps you shouldn't have been let in in the first place.
anti	Brexit is like watching a really slow train crash.It’s horrible but you just can’t look away.
pro	Brexit is no mistake whatsoever. It was our useless politicians that got us into the EU without our permission. Now the people of the UK have spoken and we are OUT. Make no mistake this was no mistake whatsoever.
pro	Brexit is no mistake. British people voted to leave the EU as they want control over who us allowed into their country.
anti	Brexit is not going to solve the causes of Brexit.
pro	Brexit is not in deadlock. We know what we want. Deadlock is just another name for trying to find a way to get out of it.
anti	Brexit is not in the UK’s interest.
anti	Brexit is such a catchy name. People fell for that like a catchy music song. The whole situation is really unfortunate. Goodbye
pro	Brexit is the best thing that happened to Britain. Britain had little say in the EU, they were easily out voted by the voluminous other countries in the EU, they supplied the 2nd most amount of dollars to the EU, but were treated like a 2nd class country.
pro	Brexit is the best thing that has happened to Britain
pro	Brexit is the best thing to happen for Russia, for America, for Germany, and for democracy.
anti	Brexit is the biggest threat to the UK since World War II. People have no idea how bad this is going to get and the populist arguments on the leave side are frighting. Over the last 2 years UK politics has completely been preoccupied by the Brexit topic and have not moved forward with any other important agenda items. Something is truly rotten in the state of... and this time it is not Denmark!
anti	Brexit is the dumbest move the UK could ever have made. If they leave the economy will risk real sever shock and they deserve every bit of it. The best move would be a revote and choose to stay. Lets not repeat the last 2 world wars because of right wing stupidity.
pro	Brexit is the first stepping stone to breaking up the EU, if god is willing by 2050 There will be NO MORE EU. Fantastic thing that will be.
pro	Brexit is the one good thing UK has ever done
anti	Brexit is the worst Choice made in the UK since..........
anti	Brexit is what happens when a false sense of superiority combines with a false sense of victimhood.
pro	Brexit is wonderful
anti	Brexit isn't a solution, EU reform is
pro	Brexit means Brexit
pro	Brexit means Exit and fcuk the EU. No deal OUT OUT OUT.
anti	Brexit means losing freedom of movement and having the army on standby.
anti	Brexit means self harm.
pro	Brexit returns that power to the queen, we know the queen was and is a brexiteers. Long live brexiteers.
pro	"Brexit should be ""The Golden New Era""? for GB."
anti	Brexit should be completely scrapped, it is suicide for the UK economy.
anti	Brexit stops Britain from being Great Britain.
anti	Brexit was a big fat mistake and now the repercussions are starting to take its toll. It’s very likely now the UK will loose Northern Ireland and Scotland very soon.
anti	Brexit was a migration issue by far. I wish they didnt leav but terrorist has strike fear into UK citizen and now isis just Won. To seperate countries. Alot of EU Countries has sufferd from terrorist attack and together we help eachother to recover.
anti	Brexit was based on fear promoted by Russia, just like Trump was based on fear and promoted by Russia.
anti	Brexit was horrible
pro	Brexit was the first brick that was knocked out of the establishment wall.
anti	Brexit was won on anti-intellecualism and distractionary fabrications (fishing etc.) This is that. Our campaign needs to be grounded in reality.
pro	Brexit will be good for the U.K.
anti	Brexit will be great for the rich. But the rest of us will go down the pan!
anti	Brexit will destroy the U.K. How can the country leave the E.U. when Scotland and Northern Ireland voted solidly against it?
anti	Brexit will lead to a flight of talent, money and taxes - and the country will have to take on more and more debt.
anti	Brexit will lead to the end of United Kingdom.
pro	Brexit won were leaving get over it
pro	Brexit, It's a beautiful thing.
anti	Brexit, the Fyre Festival of referendums.
anti	Brexit, the most pointless, masochistic ambition in our country's history, is done
anti	Brexit. Happened because of people like you
anti	Brexit=Fraud
anti	Brexiteers are the biggest liars ever🤦♂️🤦♂️🤦♂️ How do people believe these rich people part of the establishment
anti	Brexiteers are traitors to Uk I will never forgive them
anti	Brexiteers doubling down already about how easy a trade deal will be.
anti	Brexiteers still DON'T understand the BASICS. The EU works FOR its member states; NOT the other way round.
anti	Brexiters could be sat in the woods eating worms due to brexit and still not accept it was brexit that caused it...
anti	Brexiters only use sound bites because they know they have no arguements to justify brexit!
anti	Brexiters said EU will collapse. LMAO
anti	Brexiters, who are never short of absurd arguments, say that the elderly who voted leave in 2016 may well have died since but will be replaced by a new ’generation’ of elderly voters who, because age has given them wisdom, will want to quit the EU as well.
anti	Brexitiers do nothing but lie, 68 red votes denying the truth that the EU is not in a recession. Just face up to the facts that Brexit is a crap idea, but if you want to see the middle class and below poor, its not. The rich, their money comes from abroad and they will only get richer because once their money is converted into Pounds, they get more of them (Mogg for example)! Whats not to like?
anti	Britain and its coulture has much to give to the EE and should not think of leaving.
pro	Britain can laugh in Frances face when the rest of the EU realise how fake the EU is and that it was no more than a German plan to create Hitlers dream through politics, because they knew they could not win a third world war after losing the last two.
anti	Britain cannot stand alone.
pro	Britain deserves the right to self determination and representative government. The E.U. made both of those things impossible.
pro	Britain did the RIGHT thing to leave the eu - nothing good was going to happen by staying!!
anti	Britain has been at the forefront of developing the EU’s regulations. Now we are going to be a backwater with no influence at all,
anti	Britain is destroying itsself. First they lost their empire and soon they have lost their country.
pro	Britain is smarter than another european countries.
pro	Britain is superior than other European nations. Therefore, I support Brexit. Europe is becoming weaker and weaker every next day. Under german dictatorship, Europe will end up in bin..
pro	Britain lost Europe. That's a laugh! We are leaving the European Union. We can't leave Europe. Any way I knew we are going to leave as it's prophesied in the bible!
anti	Britain needs to drop the whole Brexit thing. It's dumb as hell. Just read today that England has already lost a TRILLION $ over the uncertainty on this.
pro	Britain used to be a great trading nation. I doubt we have lost those skills so the future could be very bright without EU interference.
pro	Britain was never in possession of Europe, so how could we have 'lost' it? We always have been and always will be, European; however, that does not mean we have to be content with being ruled by unelected people.
pro	Britain will be better off long term by leaving the EU. Short term there might be problems, but long term it will be better.
anti	Britain will sink like Titanic
anti	Britan should never leave the EU
pro	Britian will be fine, they don't need a bunch of socialist countries to tend to them.
pro	British empire is coming back soon. ..
pro	British politicians are traitors to democracy and the democratic referendum won by the British people to LEAVE the EU DICTATORSHIP!
anti	British screw it up, and they now don't know how to solve it.
anti	Brits are making a big mistake by exiting the EU
anti	Bullshit, not lies, is the corrosive influence blighting our public life
pro	By leaving the EU we become part of the world market not just tied up with Europe being told what and what we can't do
pro	Bye Bye EU.
pro	Bye bye EU .. 😁😁🤣🤣
pro	Bye bye EU, hello freedom! BBC = FAKE NEWS!!! SHUTDOWN THE BBC!!!
pro	Bye bye europe ! Hopefully we float away from you in the future...might take a couple million years but it'll be nice
anti	Bye bye f****in British! Greetings from Spain!
anti	Can someone please tell me why Brexit would still be a good idea today? As a European, I don't really see why anybody would want such a thing. Thanks
anti	Can't wait for Britain to slip into senile decay once the reality of brexit dawn's on everyone
anti	Can't wait for all the brexiters to suddenly disappear after Theresa May cocks the whole thing up. I'm sure they'll shut up then!
anti	Can't wait for the pound to flat line again. And for trade stocks to drop on Monday.
pro	Can't wait to leave genuinely can't wait
pro	Can't we just leave today ? , Trumps waiting to sign massive trade deals with us .
anti	Cancel Brexit!
anti	Cancellation would fix it, postponement will only extend the heartache. Ask any good divorce lawyer.
pro	Can’t wait for Brexit! We need to take our country back! If only we’d never joined!
pro	Caroline. I'm 24 years old. I voted Leave. I don't accept you trying to take away MY future and taking a huge dump on my suffrage! If my fellow cohorts from my generation wish to work in EU countries and memberstates, then they will have to apply for a work visa, stay there for so many years & have the option of citizenship. It can be done legally without being in the damn EU. It doesn't cost much either, a lot less than moving all your furniture and personal effects with you to a foreign land, to get a work visa. You, Caroline & those whom agree with you, are the enemy of the people. You are enemy against our right to suffrage, the enemy against our right to self determination & the enemy against FREEDOM! Or you just want a cushty job in Brussels in a few years time at the tax payer's expense and an EU Military to wield with nukes at your finger tips. I thought you didn't like Nuclear Caroline? I thought it was too dirty for you? I will never give up, I will never give in, I will never surrender! I will die for freedom & to protect liberty.
pro	Chaos is inevitable now its clear the EU cannot let go of its authority, even if democracy dictates that.
anti	Checker is not acceptable for EU. You are forgetting you have to negotiate with EU not just with yourselves
pro	Churchill would be looking down and be proud, my bloody oath he would, it's not the first time Britain stood alone.
pro	Churchill would indeed be proud. Thank you Brits for showing some good old fashioned backbone.
pro	Colin that is to avoid a dictatorship, trouble is the EU and it's familiars have bought the majority of the traitors in our Parliament, they are now nearly all the same. We have to get out to get democracy back.
anti	Completely agree that leaving would be a disaster. Knowledge develops as a result of collaboration and as you've highlighted, we definitely have a net gain in funds in terms of scientific research. Brexit supporters go on about how much we pay into the EU compared to how little we get out of it, yet fail to mention that we'd likely go into economic crisis with the value of the pound plummeting against the dollar, if we voted to leave. I'll definitely be voting to remain.
pro	Congatulations UK you have your country back.
pro	Congrats UK. Freedom is a beautiful thing.
pro	Congrats for finally getting out from under the German jackboot! Freedom is a wonderful thing!
pro	Congrats from America! To our friends across the pond.
pro	Congrats to Britain. The right choice was made.
pro	Congrats to all the British people for leave the evil EU dictatorship i hope others countries follow the same path.
anti	Congrats. Your vote torpedoed the UK markets & British pound. You're facing a recession of your own making. Long may you suffer
pro	Congratulations Britain! You've made the right decision. Britain for Britain. No more will the EU tell Britain how to run their own country!
pro	Congratulations UK! You've finally taken back some independence and self representation.
pro	Congratulations from Canada on leaving a system controlled by unelected, self-serving, arrogant elitists in Brussels. The UK has been and will continue to be a strong nation.
pro	Congratulations to Britain for leaving EU, hope all nations do the same!
pro	Congratulations to Great Britain in thwarting the German fascists attempting to do now what they failed to do in WW2. Respect to the British people.
pro	Congratulations to you Britain, for what you have acheived. I applaud you, your PM and this speech. Simply excellent.
pro	Congratulations, UK! <3
anti	Contribute nothing, not having to agree to standards, but get full access. Seems like the Farage only wants to use us. As if anyone would agree to that. It does not even seem that he and other brexiteers see the rest of Europe as equals.
pro	Counting down the days until Freedom!
anti	DESTROY BREXIT
pro	DT, please, this is getting ridiculous. Just yesterday you had an article that Germany is leading the charge to soften EU's stance on the backstop. YESTERDAY. Today Germany is resisting changes to the backstop, and black is white; red is blue; cats are dogs, etc. Your wishy washy coverage of the EU is laughably unstable and inconsistent. You only have one job to do: Rather than try to sugar coat reality, just put the pressure on our horrible government (and Parliament) to get us out WITH NO DEAL. We don't care what's Germany's imaginary attitude to the backstop. This is the crap deal we got believing stupid lies that the EU will budge, and pandering to Remainer fantasy that we can somehow get a deal with the EU by being soft. The EU is a slow monolith and we are leaving PRECISELY because it CANNOT change. We can. Screw the backstop, and the deal, and the EU. Let's finally go.
anti	Dear over-seas-friends. This is NOT who we are. I'm nearly 25 and I've never met these kinds of people. I've only seen them on TV. I'm so embarrassed for our country. #BrexitDay
pro	Democracy - Freedom - Independence #brexitnotbrino
pro	Democracy dosent exist in the EU !
pro	Democracy has cast the decision in UK .....why are there so many people not prepared to accept it? Nile Gardiner raises some good points here.
pro	Democracy stated a fact, the uk wants out
anti	Democracy's biggest fail. They will regret it
anti	Did the 'out people' thought about the impact this exist will have on people?? How many lives will it destroy?
pro	Do not delay the democratic result to totally leave the EU.
pro	Do not want a deal! Leave means leave!
anti	Do we think that the daily mail, the times and telegraph and the sun will ever issue an apology for lying to the British people about Brexit and the positive effects it would have. The Brexit they all promised simply doesn't exist. When will they apologise?
pro	Doesn't matter how long it takes to get back to being a sovereign nation ITS WORTH IT!
anti	Doesn't seem like Britain's exit is a blow to the dream of a united Europe, they were acting like cocky outsiders anyway. If anything it's serves as a bad example that most other countries don't want to follow. This will be really bad for England in the long term because the EU is going to negotiate those leave terms HARD. Because they can, and they might also want to punish England for leaving.
pro	Don't go, don't talk, just carry on ignoring the E.U until the 30th of March. Then phone a few countries saying we would like to buy some goods but we are talking to a lot of others too ,so let us know if you do or don't asap. We are buying are you selling
anti	Don't let Brexit destroy the Union
pro	Don't let the EU hold you back...your economy is much more powerful on its own.
anti	Done. They Out :(
pro	Dont trust anyone in the EU, all are enemies to me
anti	"Dude, you are a nationalist. You are anti-rationalist. You advocate Brexit, even though it involves economic isolation and destruction and it is splitting the nation. There is no way on Earth you are liberal"". Your quest is a 1930s style ToryKIP dictatorship."""
pro	During our years in the EU, thanks to EU grants, loans etc many UK businesses have moved out of UK, it’s been going on for 40 odd years, nothing new here. They even helped non EU US firm Fords to move their UK Transit factory to non EU Turkey, we’ve a lot to thank the EU for!
pro	EU Anti Corruption is arguably one of the biggest oxymorons know to man!
pro	EU are a bunch of cunts! And don’t forget the IRISH have Stabbed us in the FRONT and BACK. BOYCOTT IRISH PRODUCE (dairy,beef and vegetables). BUY BRITISH.
anti	EU better make zero trade deal with UK... just let the destruction follow its natural course... and please EU shut down all EU factories such as Airbus facilities from the UK and set them back in the EU
anti	EU has now free trade deal with Japan which will highly compensate the loss that Brexit created. UK has nothing. Good luck
pro	EU is a scam :-)
anti	EU is a toilet without UK
pro	EU is an extension of the third reich
pro	EU is behaving like a DESPERATE POSSESSIVE GIRLFRIEND, UK ( BOYFRIEND) is not into you (EU) anymore, grow up and let him GO..
anti	EU law is decided by the nation states in the EU. We have the power to veto any law
pro	EU memberahip goes directly against the constitution and Magna Cartna. Out with the EU!
anti	EU regulations on toy safety are designed to make sure that when you buy a toy for a child.... It is safe....... And has clear advice on the packaging
anti	EU rich powerful 1 year after Brexit united the the U.K. is in trouble.
pro	EU sucks. Just another globalist elite scheme to make themselves rich with bs climate scare tactics that will tax the working class into poverty and welfare slaves of the State.
anti	EU will happen with or without UK
pro	EU wont compromise that's your answer NO DEAL simples
pro	Embracing the freedom of Brexit gives us the choice of what sort of country we want to become and means we can look forward to a more positive tomorrow.
pro	England has been British longer than 47 years. I think that they can go back to being British easily. Cheers from America.
pro	England is part of Europe and wil allways be as any european country. A different matter is being part of EU wich is another thing. Nobody in is right mind is willing to be part of this monstruos corporate dictatorship.
anti	England won't win from this, EU will probably go on with their lives though
anti	Europe belongs together
anti	Europe belongs together. Mr. Farage and Mr. Johnson will be nailed on a pillar of shame for eternity.
pro	Europe is a socialist union, like URSS.
pro	Even if as a I customer need to pay more it WILL BE WORTH IT to get out of this sclerotic EU
pro	Even if we were to be worse off overall, I can't imagine it would be by much. And we could stick two fingers to the entire pampered greedy bureaucratic mess that is ballooning out of control with no convincing long-term ideas as we prepare to face humanity's greatest ever challenges.
pro	Ever more clear what a success BREXIT is for UK and her people. These people are authoritarians without accountability to the electorate as Farage said.
pro	Ever since England joined the EU their economy has suffered...Brussels has been screwing them for decades...in fact the only country that has really benefited from the EU has been Germany...Is Italy, Greece, Portugal and Spain really better off being in the EU?
pro	Every nation should have it's own sovereignty
pro	Everybody deserves respect. I’ve been respectful despite your insults, and repeated refusal to indulge me with a benefit of Brexit.
anti	Exactly. Brexit will make economic conditions even more challenging for young people.
pro	Extra time will not resolve anything, go straight to penalties and go for no deal.
pro	Fair enough, Walter. For me it’s a case of preferring to be governed by politicians I at least partly understand who at least share the same basic values, culture and identity that I have, and whom I feel are reasonably closely accountable.
pro	Fake news and we should just leave with NO Deal
pro	Farage is a national hero, not a villain! This honourable man spent a quarter of a century putting up with the EUSSR's bullying because he wanted to restore our right to self determination. He's a living embodiment of the Buddha's teachings, how could anyone hate such a noble man?
pro	Farage will be remembered well by history... WELL DONE!
anti	February 1st, they will continue to blame the EU for everything.
anti	Fight from within to improve the EU is a far cleverer strategy than ending up in a Cromwellian purgatory!
pro	Finally gave the people what they voted for good job
pro	Finally it is done. The last 3+ years of uncertainty is over and now they can negotiate a trade agreement not only with the EU, but also North America and others.
pro	Finally sanding up to the EU! Long overdue.
pro	Finally we see the downfall of globalism and the rise of nationalism.
pro	Following three years of turmoil, the UK is likely to have the most stable political environment in Europe
anti	For all the illiterate, ignorant idiots voted to leave, now get ready to pay £2 for a poxy lettuce, £3 for pack of tomatoes...
anti	For over 3.5 yrs I have asked Leavers what are the benefits of Brexit. I ask for any verifiable proof and only ever get feelings or false information easily proven false.
pro	France should leave the European union too
anti	Free movement will be gone. They will all be stuck on an island. Its eu leadership that needs change.
pro	Free trade is a wonderful thing let’s hope we can find away to trade freely without having to follow EU rules which is the reason we want to leave.
anti	From our perspective, just narrowly from the financial sector and from our institution, there's nothing good about Brexit.
pro	Fuck the EU and all the EU bootlickers in the comments.
anti	GB economy will suffer.
pro	GB existed before the advent of euro. What is the problem here?
pro	Germany doesn't want it, France will hate it. Both good enough reasons for a full, no deal, Brexit. Britain first.
anti	Get on with the second vote. Leave was and is a disaster economically and culturally for the UK.
pro	Get out of the EU. Don't listen to the bullies that say it's racist or xenophobic. It's not. Nothing wrong with sovereignty
pro	Get the transition period out the way ! Goodbye Europe and it's laws ! And stop those immigrants who only come here for our benifit and free health care!
anti	Glad to see America is not the only country with lots of idiots in it!
pro	Globalist go to hell...Small sovereign states and local government protect individual rights..dream of a United Europe?  Is this woman for real?  GO BREXIT
pro	Go Nigel !! The left will miss the money,and the perks!! That’s why they are upset
pro	God Bless Merry Old England. Cheers! YOU DID IT!
pro	Good for Britt. Go your own way
pro	Good for the U.K. and the exit from the European Union now the can chart their own course
pro	Good for the U.K. and the exit from the European Union now the can chart their own course.
pro	Good for them! Now they need to start kicking the Muslims out that don't want to become normal British citizens, which means to follow British Law, not Sharia Law! The Muslim women need to stop dressing like black mummies, unless they are so ugly they scare children and dogs.
anti	Good job UK, you're officially dumber than America!
pro	Good job uk it’s going to be fine but a little tight but worth it in the end
anti	Good luck asking these punters to pick up the tab.
anti	Good luck guys...hopefully we as people can stop this tide of blind nationalism that seems to be sweeping the western world.
pro	Good on you UK to have the courage, Australia stands by your great decision. The EU is a joke.
pro	Goodbye....we will keep our £39bn
pro	Great Britain has been made great again! Congratulations!
pro	Great Britain has made its Great Escape from the EU, and Nigel Farage is the real-life Steve McQueen.
pro	Great Britain is the 5th Largest economy in the world, soon to be the 3rd, then second, we never need the corrupt & undemocratic EU, they needed our money
pro	Great for the UK on leaving the globalist elite union! The Revolution is starting! Great job UK!!! I figured Scotland would be the leaders in doing so but apparently not, disappointing!
pro	Great news Britain. Free from the EU.
pro	Great news UK now get you identity back America supports you.
pro	Greatest day of our generation! Brexit... Out is the way forward!
pro	HOW MANY referendums do you need? Up until a civil war? Referendum HAS BEEN DONE. Now, DEAL WITH IT!
pro	Hahaha EU was Weak because UK LEAVE EU BUT NOT LEAVE NATO. AND GERMANY WILL CRAZY AND INVADE EUROPE AND DID NAZI THAT COMING
anti	Half of UK trade has been with EU and you are saying there's nothing to worry. Are you speaking on behalf of those UK businesses dealing with EU partners? Making it more difficult and costly to trade is something that helps UK citizens/companies in general? And you can't claim that UK can merrily just move on trading with the rest of the world with trade deals when none major ones have been signed yet. We should wait for those deals and see if UK businesses really benefit being outside of the EU single market.
pro	Happy #Brexit everyone. Rule Britannia! Lefty tears inbound.
pro	Happy Brexit everyone! We’ve finally left the EU!
pro	Happy Brexit!
pro	Happy Countdown to the Countdown to Brexit Day. Basically like the shittest birthday you've ever had.
pro	Happy days are here again, good luck Remainers, you’re going to need every bit of it.
anti	Hate has won sadly
anti	He he! The Sun trying to rally the troops again, the EU will just sit back and watch the Tories rip themselves apart all over again. If the Tories and the Brexiteers were a horse the vet would be getting a revolver out of his bag and doing the humane thing...............
anti	He thinks he will get same deals as Canada and Australia? After all they have said about EU, no way. Not to mention wiping their feet on the EU flag on Brexit day.
anti	Here’s a list of David Davis’ accomplishments whilst a minister. 1... His resignation.
anti	Hey Britain, stop making huge decisions in wildly irresponsible ways without thinking through the consequences, that's America's thing.
anti	"History exams in 2050: ""Whose fault was Brexit?"""
pro	Hmm.. people want Independence from tyranny and more control over their own taxes and fees. sounds about right.
anti	Honestly, as a student, I fear for the economic framework that will govern my future. Such a shame.
pro	Hooray for Britton ! Now you've got your own independence day
anti	How Britain shoots itself in a foot and proceeds to blame everyone else.
anti	How a slight majority of what was an advisory vote has been instrumentalised by the hard right and its fellow travellers to impose their unhealthy fantasies on the rest of the country has to be fought. In the short term, pro-remain MPs need to grow a backbone while those of us who aren't motivated by distrust and hatred of anyone who isn't ostensibly English have to start working together to build a tactical approach to fighting the next election.
anti	How about the massive decrease in World Power we will have when we're no longer one of the most powerful parties in the most powerful organisation in the world
anti	How many Brits does it take to change a light bulb?None. The Brits are too busy screwing themselves.
pro	How many elections have to be held until the elites comprehend the U.K. wants sovereignty?
pro	How many times do we have to say we just want to leave, no deal just leave.
anti	How stupid is brexit so to put it meterphorically if I was a trader and across the road was a huge market would I be arrogant and say I'm not joini g your huge market I'm going to start my own market so I don't have to pay the fee and my market will have much less trade how dumb
anti	How these Brexit MEPs have been allowed to diminish the standing of our once great nation is a tragic tale. I feel ashamed to be British
anti	How will closing Britain 🇬🇧 off be more prosperous economically?
pro	I VOTED FOR LEAVING AND NOT FOR BEING CONFRONTED WITH FACTS!!!
pro	I agree with living and working in eachothers countries but not free movement they're completely different things
anti	I agree. Brexit is down to the Tories. Decades of whinging by the Eurosceptics within the party caused Cameron to call the referendum, thinking he would win and shut them up for the next twenty years or so. However, the result of the referendum was caused by the actions and inactions of both parties. Personally, I think it starts with Thatcher and her destruction of the mining industry. But Labour share the blame, in particular, their part in the Iraq war. But none of the Brexit chaos would ever have happened if it was not for the infighting over the Common Market/EU in the Tory party. I will never forgive them for the damage they have done to this country.
anti	I am German and I am incredibly sorry to see the UK leave. I think it is a huge, idiotic mistake that will benefit no one.
anti	I am implacably opposed to Brexit and would love nothing more than to see this project consigned to the dustbin of history. I see it as a patriotic duty to do everything in my limited power to stop this act of national self-harm. I accuse Brexiteers of naivety for believing that all opposition to this damned project would vapourise post-referendum. You won the battle, mateys, not the war. To suggest that Remainers haven’t considered a post-Brexit world is plainly ridiculous. Remainers are chess players - always thinking two or three steps ahead, while Leavers are barely capable of playing the reactive game of snap. While Brexiteers were busy swallowing the Farage mirage or accepting the lies of Boris Johnson and company as gospel, Remainers were, and still are, attempting to solve potential problems that have yet to enter the Brexiteer consciousness - The MFN Principle being one major hurdle that the UK will have to face in the event of a no deal exit from the EU. I agree with the writer, Brexiteers will refuse to own their sh.. and blame Remainers for debacle that will come. Cowards all. They are already suggesting that there will be blood on the streets if the decision to leave is rescinded - so be it - Great Britain is a sovereign state and British law will dispense British justice in British courts.
pro	I am intelligent. I voted to leave. Exciting times ahead
anti	I am serious. brexit is a fight for hearts and minds, and i want us to stay in the EU.
pro	I am so happy for my UK brothers. Sovereignty is Liberty, Liberty is Freedom and Freedom is Power. God Bless You all!
pro	I am so proud of the British people who had the courage to take the UK on this incredible journey - the best has yet to come. We can do this!! I wholeheartedly believe that this was the right decision :)
pro	I assure you. We don't regret this.
pro	I campaigned for Brexit because I have always believed that Britain would be stronger, more prosperous and secure outside of the E.U.
pro	I can't believe everyone wasn't for brexit. Who wants a bureaucrat in Brussels making all your decisions . sovereignty down the crapper. What is even funnier is negative growth due to taxes and regulations in Eu> . O and the BBC always routing for the Elites .
anti	I can't help feel you voted leave because you have a belief, but lack the basic understanding of the reality.
anti	I cannot believe that all this mess we're in has been created by 65+ year old farts with pensions and nothing to worry about, and living off benefits scroogers who blame immigrants for their failures in life...
anti	I completely agree I’m a British person and I certainly voted to Remain. I hate what is happening to me and to my country all in the name of politicking.
anti	I do believe in Britain. That's why I want to #RemainInTheEU. Let's have a peoples vote with an opinion to remain and keep ourselves close to our friends & allies, at the heart of Europe.
anti	I do hope many others live to regret it.
pro	I do not want to have any part of the EU Marxist utopia.
anti	I don't deny that learning another language is beneficial especially if you work abroad. But this argument is all about anti Brexit so called adults treating leave voters like dirt. And considering this is about 1 or 2 weeks worth of holiday time....
pro	I don't know which I will celebrate first on 29th march, the end of the EU or the last time we have to see winging remainers.
anti	I don't know who the bigger idiots are here: those who are voting for Trump, or those that voted to leave the EU.
pro	I don't like to share with immigrants because of the benefits we have in paying taxes. I think Brexit may be a good thing because we can control immigration.
anti	I don't think brexiteers care about the economy they just want more control over their lives, I don't think leaving the EU will fix that but people like to believe in a fantasy almost everyone does believe in one, knowingly or not.
pro	I don't think the exit concerns boil down solely to the issue of immigration. A huge factor is the question of sovereignty - freeing the country from the control of an ever-growing undemocratic bureaucracy
anti	I don’t think we will be able to really see a change at all
pro	I feel a sane envy for the Brits, i must admit. Congrats and follow your destiny.
anti	I feel like punching every single UKIP representative in the face
anti	I feel like the UK and Europe are stronger together.
anti	I genuinely believe that the people who want to leave are uneducated halfwits
anti	I guess now Britain has left the EU and is a small player in world events on the edge of a very large player, Britain now knows how Ireland felt for so long. Its crazy we have done this to ourselves
anti	I hate being British cause I don't want Brexit
anti	I hate how everything is just going to be more expensive now >:(
pro	"I have been asking people about the Referendum. While the youngest are undecided, and the oldest are pretty sure that they will vote OUT, I have come across many for eigners who live and work in Britain. And those ones, they will vote IN ! For the serious advantages of being in Britain. So, it makes me wonder why Britain is being burdened down in being the ""Milk Cow"", the provider, the philanthropist, the do-gooder, the ""you are going to be all right here"". For eigners do behave well. But they have very little space in their heart when it is a matter of appreciating British Culture/ History/ Tradition/ Distinctiveness. Meanwhile the British people are increasingly growing spleen and ill feelings, because there is a limit to what you can impose on a Country against their will. The EU will fail. Vote OUT !"
pro	I have so much respect for the UK now
pro	I have waited patiently two years for the LEAVE I voted for, why should I wait any longer?
anti	I hope Northern Ireland will leave the UK.
pro	I hope that by leaving, Britain can inspire other countries like my own too leave as well.
pro	I hope the UK go out the EU and we the Netherlands hope will follow ,
anti	I hope you regret your decision every day for the rest of your life.
anti	I just cannot understand why so many people voted to be poorer. Now the chickens are coming home to roost - 5,000 jobs going at JLR, downtime at Honda, then all the knock ons among suppliers. This is just the start.
anti	I mean, I've never seen a country try to commit suicide before
anti	"I myself have also removed a few ""friends"" from my life that turned out to be hidden racists. Someone in my friend groups reasoning for voting leave is they were sick of all the cashiers at their local asda having accents & they want everyone to have a proper british accent so they can understand them better. Yep, that was a real reason for voting leave."
pro	I never regret brexit, I want to get out without, yesterday.
pro	I never supported Europe because it is undemocratic but to blame our own economic downfall on Europe is delusional. I'm glad we're out but we really could have performed far better than we have and if we don't make some dramatic changes to how the UK is run, we are going to make as much of a hash of Brexit as we have done with European membership
pro	I pray the rest of Europe breaks away from the joke of the EU
pro	I propose a deal! Treason Mays Deal, which means not leaving or NO Deal, which means we are Free!
pro	I really can't understand why young people would vote remain! I guess if it's all you've known then it's like an abusive step-dad.  But the 'green' vote for remain is absolute twaddle.
pro	I really wonder why noone is able to even research a basic understanding of the european political system. From John Oliver to the Daily Show to Vox, they claim the EU is synonymous with the common market in Europe. And this map demonstrates this error quite nicely. They say it will be harder for goods to move to and from Britain because it will leave the common market. But why exactly are Switzerland and Norway the same colour as a Britain which left the common market? Are you implying Switzerland and Norway aren't part of the common market? That is what these idiots seem to think. You don't have to be an EU member to be an EEA member or a member of the common market you idiots.
pro	I say vote to leave for few years see how we cope take it from there
pro	I see the UK being a nimble global player reaching outwards into the world, as an independent and proud nation.
pro	I see why people might seem mad and scared of the consequences of the loss of this nation but, you have to take into mind that somewhere along the lines change was imminent. I'm sure that Great Britain is going in isolation mode to make their nation even more prosperous. Keep calm everyone, based on history this can only lead to success.
pro	I smell globalist propaganda and boy does it stink. Centralized power is only for the elite, do yourself a favor and read some history. BTW immigration is not always a good thing, look up Swedish rape crisis.
anti	I so hope they do an other referendum!! THIS WAS A HUGE MISTAKE...
pro	I support Brexit
pro	I support Brexit, no one knows what will happen after Brexit, but why not try it?
anti	I think Brexit is disappointing from an economic perspective.
anti	I think Brexit is the biggest blunder in UK’s history for a very, very long time.
pro	"I think GB made a good choice. Notice how I said ""good"" instead of right choice. Sometimes in life we must make a 'not so right' choice to obtain what we want. Congratulations!"
anti	I think Johnson is losing it. The hair ruffling has gone full Ken Dodd. He just needs some diddymen now.
anti	I think everyone knows why Brexiters voted for Brexit. From my perspective those reasons appear to fall into two categories: Completely impractical wishful thinking of outcomes which on the surface sound good; and outright terrible ideas usually based on misinformation, faulty logic or emotional reasons.
anti	I think it was a knee jerk reaction based on fear .Not based on the true danger of conservatives.
pro	I think it's a great move...to be in control of your own country is a good move.
anti	I think that BREXIT is not good for both the Britain and EU. The Britain should play a more positive role as Germany did.
pro	I think the British will be ok after Brexit.
pro	I think this is the best thing for the EU
anti	I thought brexit was stupid and I still think its stupid
pro	I vote leave the EU to give my children and grandchildren a better future!
pro	I voted Leave because I don't want to be part of the United States of America, any more than the United States of Europe. I don't fear Russia or China, I do fear an EU super army.
pro	I voted Leave. I made my mind up freely. This is just another attempt to stop Brexit. Fed up with the moaning because the remain side did not win. We are leaving end of.
anti	I voted Remain, not just for political reasons but because my mum’s moved to Spain and I want her to stay there
anti	I voted STAY - because I may want to move to Sweden or Denmark one day, especially if the Tories keep winning elections.
pro	I voted for brexit for various reasons but the main reason is the lack of transparency in the EU.Most people I know cannot name even one MEP . There was also the fact that there is a great deal of lobbying going on resulting in policies benefiting larger corps who have the money .
pro	I voted leave and have no regrets what so ever.
pro	I voted leave and not affraid to say I did.
anti	I voted remain and don't regret it for a second. I still think its a fucking stupid idea.
anti	I voted remain. Knowing eu got big problems. Better the devil...
pro	I voted to leave because QMV is undemocratic and that since 2009 any decision against the EUs’ agenda to consolidate its own power and to increase federalisation fails because of QMV.  Britain doesn’t want a closer federalised union, the EU does, these are two irreconcilable viewpoints. But hey ho, it's much easier just to call me a stupid uneducated racist right.
pro	I voted to leave i dont remember anything about a deal on the ballot paper it was a simple choice leave or remain we voted leave now thats what we should do.
pro	I voted to leave, not negotiate!
anti	I want a no deal brexit, high taxes, massive immigration of british people to eu and just a HAHA TOLD U SO moment.. super mean, but this has been mind fuckery
pro	I want the EU to fall. It's not right that one Union should be able to create laws that overrides a nations laws
pro	I was Leave then and I’m leave now VOTE LEAVE
anti	I was absolutely gutted by the result. I still feel we should have remained in. However, it's vital that the British people unite to make a success of this. There are definitely opportunities and if 48% of the population stand around whinging we won't have a chance of making this work for us.
anti	I was strongly against Brexit. I speechified against Brexit.
anti	I was woken up early by the thought of how I would feel if Brexit happens. It's not good. Intense despair would be one emotion, and extreme anger and hate would be another. If a few million people feel like me, this country will be heading for very bad times.
anti	I went through my stuff yesterday to check how many British products I actually use: I found just a Colman's mustard. Bottom line: If he goes to a trade war with EU he will loose.
anti	I wish there was hope, but we are all bracing for hard brexit
anti	I'd have so much more respect for the Brexit Tories if they had a plan. An agreed desired goal and thought about how they would get there.
pro	I'm 27 and voting to leave the EU is the single greatest thing I've ever done in my life.
pro	I'm American but I'm glad to see the UK become free from the progressive globalists, let the uk be run by the uk
pro	I'm American, but I realize that the European Union is bad for Britain just like our overpowered federal government is bad for the state governments.
pro	I'm a benite socialist. So no problem with immigration big problem with a European superstate project that the average person feels little political accountability with.
anti	I'm a german and I say that Europe without GB is ridiculous. I vote stay. And if you look at this video the Brexiteers have been using the same falsification an disinformation techniques the Nazis used in 30ies. Most of what they pretend is simply not true.
anti	I'm an American.. so i don't know much about the issue...but even i can tell this is probably a shit deal.
pro	I'm astonished that anyone would want to stay in the EU.
pro	I'm delighted we have left.
pro	I'm happy for England and brexit now you can start making a better living and getting ahead in life. God bless you
pro	I'm no fan of Britain. It's no democracy. But IMO it's best move would be to walk out of the EU today without paying anything. I'd be planning high taxes on.German cars just like America should. The US can and should take steps to crash Deutsche Bank. The goal, bankrupt Europe.
pro	I'm not english but I'm THRILLED for the UK. Another blow to the new world order.
pro	I'm not old and I voted to leave!, so happy with decision. England needs to stop trying to control everything and be involved in everything and just worry about themselves for once
pro	"I'm willing to bet most people in power didn't want this because they never believed the country would vote Leave and were worried about their careers after possibly being on the losing side. My guess is many people will start to ""come out"" as lovers of independence and be a bit more positive. It will be slow, but the closer the actual divorce comes the more and more people will be okay with it. In ten years, no one will even talk about it anymore. A new era begins. Congrats you limey cunts MEGA"
pro	I'm with a Free Britain
anti	I've NEVER been ashamed of being English until these last two years....
pro	I've changed my mind from remain to leave.
anti	I've never been so ashamed to be British
pro	I've never understood the argument over so called EU money for the poorer regions. It's our bloody money to begin with!
pro	I've watched this many time, what a great speech. Gives me chills.
anti	IF UK leaves the EU, a lot of Jobs there (in Finance etc) will be destroyed! Phuu...so or so UK is in a BAD situation!
anti	Idiocracy . You wouldn't expect this from a country that went through so much in the past to become a world power and who had the chance to rule the EU. Ungrateful idiots giving up their privileges earned by their ancestors.
anti	Idiotic, xenophobic, self-defeating populism is alive and well on both sides of the Atlantic.
anti	If Brexiters were to form their own country it would be a Third World country.
pro	If England should chose between Europe and the High seas she should always chose the high seas a quote from Winston Churchill weal always bounce back because were English it's what we do 👍
anti	If anyone can look at this video and still think leaving is a good idea then they should be sent back to school!
pro	If not for the fear mongering that the economy will collapse then more people would've voted leave. The stocks plunges a few points and then literally rallies back to where it started and people fuss about it.
pro	If the UK makes trade deals with the USA, Canada, Australia, and other english speaking countries, they will be just fine.
pro	If the UK were the size of Norway this might be true, but people don't say this about countries like Canada, Korea, Australia or any other state that isn't part of the EU but has a decent trading relationship with it.
anti	If their goal is less power and influence in the world, then it's a good move.
anti	If this ends up being the case we #remain voters genuinely need to take to the streets, the 🇬🇧 government can’t take away economic & life opportunities from us and then expect us to pay the #leave voters for screwing us all. How much is it costing you to save the Tory party?
anti	If we exit the EU, foreign investors will desert us. Investment by foreign multinationals is the number one way to grow the economy.
anti	If we have a chance to rethink then for all our sakes, but particularly for the poorest, let us go back towards Europe.
anti	If we leave the economy will drastically drop, yes it might grow after a year or two but leaving the EU effects the poorer people in the country rather than the wealthy individuals
pro	If we stay the EU turns into USSR and collapses, these idots just want to watch the world burn. Good thing we're in the process of leaving.
anti	If you look at it ideologically, I would say Brexit is not something that probably is good for the world.
pro	If you vote to remain that will eliminate any chance or a renegotiation with the EU- for a safer and more prosperous Britain- #VoteLeave
pro	If you want to abandon the UK and go live on the continent nothing is stopping you. Let the UK be independent.
pro	If you want to see disasters, just look across the channel to the EU - Italy’s insolvent banks, Deutsche bank could be the next Lehman Brothers with all its Toxic derivatives, France ungovernable, Greece still a mess, Germany about to enter recession, a steadily declining economic competitiveness vs Asia and a demographic time bomb thanks to feminism. They also have issues with immigration. In the UK, we have spare ports capacity and loads of airports to buy food from all around the world - Tesco flies in fresh veg from Kenya. Will do alright...
pro	Im from Bulgaria and i wont we to exit EU to. We are part of EU from 2007 and everyting is more bad then before
anti	Im going to enjoy the street interviews of confused Brexiteers outside their farmacies wondering why they're empty.
anti	Imagine how much energy and faff has been spent on Brexit. It could have been spent elsewhere and making the country a better place. A huge shambles and a national embarrassment
pro	Imagine how much stronger the UK would be if all the anti brexiters left
pro	Immgrant is destroying england. Brexit means Brexit
pro	In a nutshell. I can’t wait till we’re out 🇬🇧
pro	In my Eyes is European Union evil mechanism led by few for their own good and it needs to be stoped.
anti	In other words - it's a small bump for EU and suicide for UK.
pro	In the construction trade we're flooded with Eastern Europeans doing poor work for low money. It's constricting the industry and genuine builders can't get work as the Europeans are half the price. But they don't pay tax, mortgage, run families and cars and bills etc... they eat poorly and live badly so don't need the income to meet UK expected standards of living. That gives the rest of us no choice but to drop our prices or have no work. Meanwhile our house prices, rent, food, fuel etc.. prices all increase.
anti	Increase taxes on remoaners. They need to pay for what they put the nation through
anti	Indeed, Brexit represented the end of politics and the start of post-truth manipulation.
pro	Is it just me that thinks we should already be seriously protesting against this government. For the total disrespect for the Leave vote.
anti	Isolated, weaker, worse off and divided. Yes we did it. Brilliant Nige.
anti	It almost feels like she is trying to get the remainers and the 'soft' leavers to join together against the full on UKIP nightmare.
anti	It doesn't matter which way brexit goes it breaks either the economy or democracy, once the vote is leave there is no outcome that works.
pro	It feels a bit like British people on tour talking to foreigners in that way of going 'what we want, is we don't want free movement but we want access to the single market' and they're going 'well, you cannot have that' and we're going 'no you don't understand, WE WANT...
pro	It is our future we are talking about here. If you want eurocrats who have no interest in British welfare to control and decide your future then vote stay. If you want your future in your own hand then vote LEAVE!
anti	It is seriously going to hurt UK and in the end EU will offer to help and let them back in but only if UK agrees to specific terms unconditionally. ...Which will still be a better deal than staying out.
pro	"It means britain is not getting punked by a ""union"" that helps overrun its nations with ignorant islamists who cant keep out of trouble and try to change others governments. GOOD FOR THEM."
anti	It seems that this no-deal strategy is being supported by those who want to create a subservient feudal class structure of selected ‘haves’ who will ‘own’ all of those who have been disadvantaged by austerity as well as those who will be ‘pushed down’ to become subservient to those who are recommending ‘no deal.’
anti	It seems to me that the person to cancel Brexit would be a fucking hero. I mean, they'd be a new king arthur
pro	It took a man to liberate Britain from the EU tyranny. Eat your heart out Theresa May!
pro	It was a bad idea to join in the first place because you can't squish 27 national policies into one without either becoming a true single country or risking an outlier fall out of parity/benefit
pro	It was a risky move leaving, but a BRAVE one. I've never been more proud of GB. If they can identify a problem and fix it, America can too!!!
anti	It was born of lies. Good idea. BesidesBritain is not a world power any longer. It is part of Europe.Vote again.
anti	It wasn't the EU that closed the docks, the mines, the car factories and the steelworks
anti	It will be a good lesson never to entrust the rabble with giving their opinions on topics that demand expertise and experience.
pro	It will be brilliant , walk away from the pen pushing, triple red tape corrupt EU, it's only good for the few elites.. WTO here we come and we will never look back..
pro	It worked fine before the eu... why not now ? Sure there are a few issues to sort out but so be it
anti	It's a dumb decision that will benefit noone in the end, and I hope the UK government will see reason and turn it around before it's too late.
pro	It's a no brainier, let's go. Where did the word Great come from in Great Britain? Not from being in the EU that's for sure...
anti	It's about destructive self-interest.
pro	It's all ,could happen,maybe happen,possibly happen ! But the fact is no one knows what will happen ! But what I think should happen is farmers stop leaving their fields fallow and grow food for UK,civil servants start to work fir their high wages and do the jobs that the EU has been doing for them for years, we should start making more deals with none EU country's ,put more control on our borders,remove every foreigner in our prisons back to their own country's, I could go on and on because it'd isn't take a Eton or any other public school to use a bit of common sense to put uk on the road to self governing .
anti	It's been few years since UK vote leave but I'm devastated about lack of knowledge from British people what is EU. How this people could vote when they don't have basic knowledge how EU works
anti	It's clearly going to be a monumental disaster that will destroy the economy and send hundreds of thousands of jobs to mainland Europe.
pro	It's eight working weeks until Brexit Day! The 29th March will be a glorious day of independence when the UK takes back full control of our sovereignty, laws, borders, money, trade, fishing waters & agriculture. under WTO rules. MPs must not block what the people have voted for.
pro	It's good to see somebody showing a bit of pride in Britain's numerous achievements. If the BBC had their way, we would all hate Britain, the British and everyrhing we stand for. I for one am ready to say goodbye to the BBC.
anti	It's incredibly stupid. Because I weighed the factors and can't see a way for the benefits to outweigh the cost
anti	It's kind of amusing that people say that it will fix the NHS when the NHS is in favour of staying in the EU.
pro	It's not all about economy, the country has spoke and we want to be out of the EU!
anti	It's not so complicated, I'll make it easy for all you British bums: brexit is dumb
anti	It's not up to the EU to solve a British civil war with itself. Theresa May committed to the current deal, and then 4 weeks later reneged on that commitment. Do British commitments mean nothing any more?
pro	It's simple normal people in Great Britain want Freedom, therefore didn't accept EU dictatorship!
anti	It's something that is completely irreversible - we will never get back into the EU on the same terms we have now
pro	It's such glee to see the liberals with their knickers in a twist, been a long long time coming.
pro	It's the EU that will no longer have billions a year from Britain. It's the remaining EU members that will pay for it. Britain will be too busy trading with the rest of the world to notice.
pro	It's us the British that will decide who wins and the British people have had enough of immergration. Do the right thing for our children our grandchildren and all those before that gave so much for us to have this referendum. VOTE LEAVE
pro	Italy fell into recession on Friday. Spain Portugal and Greece not far off again. They want our £39bn to support these countries. Why would we want to be part of a sinking ship. Let’s help it sink faster
pro	Italy is in an recession...italy will be next to leave The end of the EU is coming! Countries will be richer and better off without these unelected idiots at the helm
anti	Its about as good an idea as concentration camps and splitting up families
pro	Its so damn nice to have a PM that talks up the nations prospects.
pro	Its the people country and not the experts. Experts on what is best for them and not experts on what is best for you the people who dared to vote for your own self interest.
pro	It’s #Brexit Eve! I haven’t been this excited since the exit poll was announced on election night 🇬🇧💙
anti	It’s better inside the eu
anti	It’s very easy to Tweet about the financial advantages of Remaining and the financial risks of Brexit - But it’s not the main reason I back Remain. The EU is the most successful peace project in the modern world. A continent known for strife is now at peace.
pro	I´m brazilian and I live in Brasil. I support brexit. My country has been destroyed by the socialists during 30 years and I know that EU bureocratics are socialists that want to implement a socialist government in Europe. UK is correct to leave this evil EU. All members of EU must to implement referendum.
anti	I’m heartbroken for you all. Isolationism isn’t the answer
anti	I’m just here as an American glad we aren’t the only country that seems like a prequel to Idiocracy and Black Mirror.
anti	I’m so depressed by #Brexit and those awful Tory twats. I can’t face any of the news, not one little bit.
anti	I’m sorry Europe. Not all of us want to go.
pro	I’ve been waiting 4 years for this yes Borris my man
anti	I’ve had enough of brexit it’s totally stupid leaving
anti	Johnson, a very poor orator, leading the UK ever more downwards.
anti	Just a single fact. British customs started stopping and controls parcels from EU. This is nightmare because customers waiting for their purchased products few weeks. I guaranteed them 5 days and now it extended to 3 weeks. Chaos.
anti	"Just because you ""won"" a dodgy referendum doesn't mean we all have to bow down & worship everything you say!"
pro	Just get out . it is what the people voted for
pro	Just leave already
pro	Just look how EU treat yo now Brits. Like some enemies, they hate you. Well done leaving.
pro	Just means we'll have work to do. Sick of lazy Britain. We will be fine! We want no deal!
anti	Just stay in the EU
pro	LEAVE ALREADY!!! BREXIT!!!
pro	LEAVE IS BETTER FOR BRITAIN , OVER A DECADE HUMP, ECONOMY & CULTURE WILL GO BRIGHT THAN EVER BEFORE !
pro	LEAVE MEANS LEAVE - we did not vote for a deal - we the people voted to leave.
pro	Leave
anti	Leave lied.
anti	Leave means companies leave the UK and relocate to the EU.
anti	Leave means companies leave the UK and relocate to the EU. Great job Nigel Farage, Boris, Rees Mogg, and others.
pro	Leave means leave. Sign the UK open petition for a no deal Brexit 347,360 MBGA
pro	Leave means leave. The people will be respected.
pro	Leave sooner the better
pro	Leave the EU
pro	Leave the EU for your better future.London is crowded and if we remain then there will be no place in London for the citizens
pro	Leave, leave and quickly...and not come back...NEVER.
pro	Leave: I want our laws to be decided in Westminster not Brussels
anti	Leavers have played right into the hands of these traitors
anti	Leavers, you've doomed us all..
anti	Leaving a large market will do damage to the UK economy. I am still waiting for somebody to tell me how we will be better off.
pro	Leaving is not racist, the true racists are those that wish to remain, when will they open their eyes and see that the world is out there not some closed shop like the EU.
anti	Leaving is stupid.
pro	Leaving the EU = democracy Not-leaving = no-democracy simple stuff
anti	Leaving the EU is a weakness. It signals that the UK is powerless and has no voice. This is the UK that the world is seeing right now. Other nations cannot understand why we are putting ourselves through this. Is there any sign that WTO will be any better (with Trump now saying he wants to leave - where does that leave us)? If you guys don't 'agree' with the decision of 160 odd WTO member countries, are you going to be insulting to them too? The problems we have are WITHIN, not out with.
pro	Leaving the EU is inherently a good thing. There is no reason that a country should slave itself to the interests of other countries. Globalism is not possible. Different countries have different cultures, economies, and political interests that are often incompatible.
anti	Leaving the EU is retarded and has almost zero benefits and I think if they're honest with themselves, most people know it. They just spin these elaborate webs of fear of immigrants and red tape to make it look logical but its a stupid emotional movement.
anti	Leaving the EU was a horrible decision...
anti	Leaving the European Union was a big mistake. You will all regret it in a few years.
anti	Leaving was the stupidest thing we have ever done, the only consolation is that all the racist, right wing turds that voted leave are the ones who will suffer the most, if your person with a brain between your ears GET OUT OF THE UK or you'll be rounded up into camps soon.
pro	Let's Leave: The EU wastes your money http://bit.ly/28P4tTR
anti	Let's be honest. Considering the enormity of the damage that is being brought upon the country and upon every single one of us I am dismayed by the deafening silence of us remainers. The consequences of Brexit are similar to that of an alien invasion and yet, no effective tangible expression of the extreme pain it is causing is being made visible. As far as the government is concerned we do not exist. In France people can paralyse the country because of some small new tax they don't like. In the UK the country we know and love is literally being ripped away from under out feet and we do little more that sit, watch and hope. Just over seventy years ago British people died for this country. Is this really the best we can do?
pro	Lets make Britain Great again.
pro	Lets make our great Britain SUPERIOR AGAIN
pro	Lets start the liberation of Europe from the EU
pro	Let’s keep rolling this up to a major level. project fear. Not. If you have an opinion then express it by signing this Petition 229963. Leave the EU without a deal in March 2019.
anti	Like America with Donald Trump England with Boris Johnson has screwed itself. Good luck on a screwed economy.
anti	Lol - we've gone from Brexit will be great to now survivable. Brexit is a complete con.
anti	Looks like Britain woke up to the fact nationalism isn't good for a modern country. Patriotism is perfectly fine, but nationalism is just isolationism with more losers.
anti	Looks like we are going back to Victorian values. Where wealth is in the hands of a few and the workers have little or no rights.
pro	Looks to me like the EU is getting twitchy about UK being successful. Leave it to the french and Germans to support the other 25. Thank god we are out and no longer subsiding half of Europe especially bailing out Ireland
pro	Love seeing some good ole DEMOCRACY in action
pro	Made me realise eu only want our money don’t care about us I would still vote leave
pro	Make the UK great again
anti	Many English people feel more proud to be European citizens than being only small English citizens, because England have no influence in the world. After Brexit, England will become an insignificant country, and they have to show their visas on their passport if they visit Europe.
pro	Many many thanks brexiteers you just gave Scotland the final push to become an independant nation again.
anti	Many people hate the EU because they are jealous! Long Live the European Union!
anti	Mark Blyth is a remainer and Brexit is an absolute disaster for working people
pro	Mass Muslim Immigration. That is all. If this problem isn't dealt with all other arguments are irrelevant.
anti	Massive lying on both sides but staying in and reforming it is better than leaving and not knowing what to do (even Farage has said he doesn't know a plan of what to do after leaving)
anti	Missing EU already
pro	Money is obviously important, but I think it will be a huge blessing if Britain cannot afford to pay welfare. Then, half the Muslims will be forced to go to somewhere like Germany to continue leeching. In the long run, you will save not only tons of money, but also will save your countries, and such great, great traditions. What a rich, wonderful heritage to uphold. God bless Great Britain!!!
pro	More Brexit benefits ......BBC News - Ikea announces first big UK store closure
pro	More likely the beginning of the end for the crooked EU Up with democracy and freedom
anti	Most brexiters make the mistake of thinking the £39billion can be withdrawn, it can't. its UK obligations that will be paid to the EU, regardless of a deal or no deal.
anti	Most of the EU legislation is good for majority of British citizens such as workers rights, consumers rights and laws to stop companies damaging the environment
pro	Most of the world doesn’t belong to the EU and they seem to manage.
anti	Most people don't want Brexit..it's a political, economic & social nightmare!!#StopBrexit #RevokeArticle50
anti	My brother, who, unlike me, is a Brexit fan, rightly said that the people called for Farage and they got Theresa May. All are punished, said I. At least we can still agree on something.
pro	My daughter rang me at 5am to tell me we are out. I cried like a baby. Best day of my life
anti	My family did, I voted to stay in Europe. They were lied to but they still beleive the daily mail over informed commentators.
anti	My mortgage has increased by 7.87% overnight. Thanks Brexit
pro	My thoughts? Get out as soon as possible.
anti	NO BORIS, YOU DON'T HAVE A TRADE DEAL. YOU HAD BUT YOU THREW IT IN THE BIN.
pro	NO DEAL ! Brexit is NOT about Trade ! It’s is about taking back Control of OUR COUNTRY !
pro	NO DEAL and total exit. The EU owes us untold billions if not trillions of pounds. They don't deserve a damned farthing and all the deals propose giving them money.
anti	NO TO BREXIT 😈 STOP BREXIT NOW 😈 IT'S A DISASTER 😈 WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER COMMON SENSE REALLY THINK ABOUT IT?
pro	Nationalism is waking up again all over the West, Globalism shouldn't have kicked the sleeping giant.
pro	Nice to find out that they want agreements now their right to bully and threaten the UK has ended. Or have they just crapped them selves over the number of large financial groups from the EU that have applied to operate from London.
pro	Nigel on the money again.
anti	No Brexit please!!!
pro	No Deal Brexit creates jobs for the EU!
pro	No deal Brexit is the only option that has signed into law.
pro	No deal brexit is not a bad thing
pro	No deal is better than being in the Eu
pro	No deal is the best deal and we will be just fine.
pro	No deal is what we voted for. The eu know we ain’t going to leave without a deal. So they hold all the cards ffs. For Britain is the only way to save this country. Anne Marie waters is the only person to re install sanity.
pro	No deal means independence obviously
pro	No deal that was the vote
pro	No deal will make the UK fanancially better off its a fact
anti	No matter what happens now at this point, it's bad for the UK.
anti	No people's vote, no Brexit.
pro	No we voted leave that is what we want.
pro	No-deal Brexit means you're no longer subservient to a govt of officials you didn't elect. It means taking back control of your own nation.
anti	Nobody should believe the above mixture of lies and distortions pedalled by these self-serving Brexit chancers.
anti	None of the Brexiteer's now say we will be better off. They promise sacrifice short term pain, bumps in the road, hiccups nobody is promising prosperity only Davis.
anti	Not a word about food prices rising after brexit. Starvation is coming to our country I'm leaving it and going to Europe as 27 countries can't be wrong . Brexit is based on lies and a lack of education in England. People who voted for it are old people from provisional towns and villages with no imagination who are still living in the British empire bye bye used to be great Britain
anti	Not all British thanks very much. 48% of us are still baffled how 52% of the population are idiots who can’t seem to grasp anything logical or remotely factual
anti	Not even a hard brexit can cure a stupid brexiteer.
anti	Not going to get anything off the EU some of the British still think that United Kingdom is still half the world sorry to tell u its only a dot on the map now and it hardly has anything to offer anyone in the world because we ain't the world anymore we're nothing
anti	Not necessarily...I'm 66 and I am a staunch remainer and so are all my retired expat friends.
pro	Not one person voted.for.this.childless fool! BREXIT ...No Deal!
pro	Not really a big fan of the British, but this man leaves many leaders behind. Excellent speech and leader. You've all done well to elect him.
anti	Nothing could be more symbolic of our future path than the fact that we are leaving at midnight... on European time. Britain's future is tied to the EU and we've just surrendered all say in it.
anti	Now all power is in a the hands of a billionaire government. Scotland will be free and England can suffer the mess on there own
pro	Now is the time to heal from EU damage and grow freely without being held down.
pro	Now our country can look forward to a bright future, freed from the shackles of the EU. With the economy robust and employment booming, Britain has defied the critics who predicted that a Leave vote would be a catastrophe.
anti	Now seeing this. i see how many stupid people the UK haves. dont know anything and there are only old people talking. bye UK good luck you will lose a lot!
anti	Now that Brexit is done, what will the UK public blame their problems on next?
pro	"Now they're finally free. Free to send home all those nasty Polish people who work in the constructions for peanuts (so that they can employ British people willing to take those jobs); free to keep all those Pakistani having tens of children each who will be financially supported until university; free to make things difficult for students and researchers wanting to come into the UK . forgetting that once those scientists come up with some good idea the patent is British's property and the whole country benefits from that; free to compete alone with giants like China and have people work for salaries comparable to those in China. Competing means to produce more, better and cheaper than your competitors. In case you're having a fit of nostalgia for when Britain was a great empire, know that domination is not an option anymore. You prefer the word ""colonisation"", though infact you colonise Mars or Antartica, but you dominate a country when you impose your rule on a place that is already inhabited."
anti	Now three world powers USA, Russia and China will play with the UK.
pro	Now we can send those Muslims and Somalis back to Germany and France.
anti	Now we wait and see a once great nation crumble into dirt
anti	Obviously leaving the EU would be a massive economic catastrophy. This is highlighted by almost every industry apart from the few that would benefit (eg insolvency practicioners).
pro	Of course he voted remain he's from London. Lol
anti	"Oh Great! Brexit is now ""survivable"". Well that's something to look forward to! Thanks Leavers!"
anti	Oh dear. The Express has finally discovered that Brexit will leave Britain worse off. And it is SHOCKED... Time for them to join the growing #StopBrexit campaign.
pro	Oh please stop with the scaremongering
anti	Oh please 🙄 Europe has made plenty of exceptions for Britain.
anti	Ok UK, good luck with flushing your economy down the toilet. Maybe you can turn your island into an Industrial Revolution Museum and live off ticket sales eh?
anti	Ok just don't ask for help when your weak England gets into another world war
anti	Ok, it's been 2 days and I still think #Brexit is rubbish. Sorry.
anti	One among the many. I wonder if someone somewhere is keeping up a tally of what these increasingly important negative impacts the Brexit will have on Britain. When that number is calculated, I would like to be on the side looking at the facial expression of the leavers -with popcorn in my hands.
anti	One day we will realise thst brexit was the biggest error the UK has made in centuries.
anti	One day, a second people’s vote will bring us back into the EU. But when?
pro	One of the best days for the UK ever!!
anti	One of the most common reason I hear for leaving the eu is that the eu needs the uk more than the uk needs the eu. Ok so how does that justify leaving? It's like a spoilt child attitude. Regardless of who needs who more we still benefit hugely from our eu membership. The fact a trade deficit exists will still be a huge problem for the uk to solve even if we exit.
anti	One of the responsibilities of a government is to prevent people from doing spectacularly stupid things.
pro	Only countries that are prepared to grovel and do as they're told are welcome in the EU
anti	Only good thing about the whole thing, is that it's the best shitshow in town.
anti	Only idiots want to leave. Unity has proven more efficient than divided.
anti	Or the other way of looking at it: brexit is when you get drunk and decide that all the people you came to a club/event with should leave because a few of you decide to go (despite the fact that they are having a good time). So you tell the your mates that you are all leaving but before they can get to the door (a sensible way out) you try to push one of your good buddies, London out of a window, whilst shouting “I want a red, white and blue exit”. When he fights back you call him an “enemy of the group”. Kicking him in the stomach, through the glass and disabling him preventing him from working for life. You stare out the window and say “going without for a little whilst will do you good”. When the club/event step in and ask you to pay for the drinks you have and leave, you get upset and say the only reason the club wanted you was for the money, and refuse to pay. “39 pounds, outrageous”. Not realising it is not a massive sum of money to the 27 investors that bought the club. In the corner you notice your Irish buddy is holding hands with one of the bar maids who happens to be Irish. He explains to you that it’s good for them to be close and he doesn’t want to leave. So you smash him over the head drag him out and tell him that technology will fix this problem. Your Scottish friend is sitting there shaking their head whilst whilst highlighting the fact that you always seem to decide what everyone else is doing. He doesn’t want to go so. You smash him over the head and drag him out. Your welsh buddy is so drunk that he didn’t even realise that he was at the event so he agreed that you should leave. But on the way out he turns to you and asks where he’s going to get music and alcohol from. You can only say “it is the will of the people” which in his drunken state he repeats. As you step out into the cold your fists bloodied, you realise that you won’t be able to work at the factory for a whilst, while your hands mend, which will affect your income. As you walk into the cold, with no coat, no taxi and no clue where your going, you start to think ‘maybe this wasn’t a good idea’ but then you remember ‘it was all the remainers fault’. “They should have just accepted the will of the people” you mutter as you drag your two unconscious mates from Ireland and Scotland, behind you.
anti	Or we could stop Brexit, stop the economic suicide, stop the bonfire of human rights, stop the wastage, stop the insularity, stop the madness.
pro	Our globalist puppet leaders can't make us feel inferior without our own consent. Choose self-respect, choose freedom, Vote Leave.
pro	Our universities and NHS have been abused by this sense of global entitlement from our academics and medical professionals. We need to take back control.
pro	Out means Out . We knew what we were voting for but these idiotic remain politicians are trying to turn the result over and say we didn’t know what we voted for , of course we knew what we voted for
anti	Outwardly, I'm polite. But, inside I'm 100% convinced that Brexiters have fucked over this country. Millions of morons walk among them.
pro	"People are braver than politicians. They say 'we're quite happy to leave if we can't get a deal'. Parliament needs to recognise that's what the British people are saying."" #standup4brexit"
pro	People from Europe should be moved back straight away they are committing crimes and harassing our kiss government should be taking action they come here and pretend to be English ridiculous we want our old England back which is safe and respectful these people from Spain and Germany etc no manners
pro	People tend to forget that the UK was very much a prosperous nation prior to the EU. I'm sure they will survive again.
pro	Peter Shore was correct. Before the left became the right and the right became the left.
anti	Play stupid games. Win stupid prizes. Voting has consequences. I'm sure most Britons regret their decision already.
pro	Please Britain leave! Freedom is more important! The economy will only go up! Hope you leave and hope more leave after you! From Lithuania
pro	Please God , that the British people vote to leave this communist EU, once Britain goes the rest will follow soon ....
anti	Please don’t listen to the Brexiteers’ madness which asserts that, because we have huge plants here, we will not move and we will always be here. Listen to the experts' hard facts rather than the Brexiteers' woolly thinking #StopBrexit
anti	Please explain the advantages of Brexit, because I'm lost.
anti	Please please please please stop this madness and admit brexit is a shit idea.
pro	Please remember all the people who died in the world wars to stop this type dictatorship. If we vote in all these people will have died for nothing. VOTE OUT lets make Britain great again.
anti	Plus it was pretty clear that Brexit would cause us to lose lots of great and qualified doctors and nurses.
anti	Pound will be worthless when they leave
anti	Pro-Brexit people are bunch of idiots just like Trump, Putin and Erdogan supporters.
pro	Project fear planted a story last week that all British people would require atleast 15 months on their passport to be able to travel to an EU nation after Brexit. The sheer number and ball face cheek of the project fear lies is astonishing. Some people genuinely believe due to project fear, that after Brexit they “won’t be able to travel to and from Europe” anymore!
pro	Put the great back in Britain, leave now, no deal.
pro	Quite possibly one of the best days of my life.
pro	REAL BREXIT IS NO DEAL BREXIT
anti	Really hope Brexit doesn’t happen after what’s happened.
anti	Regardless of what the UK does. I hope for Scotland to declare independence from England and remain part of the EU.
anti	Rejoin.
anti	Remain voters should and will follow only one agenda - surprise, surprise: to remain!
anti	Remain!
anti	Remain, an expat. I paid UK tax and NI for 10 years, but I've been out of UK for last 18, so I had no vote. Thankfully my chosen home will let me stay. I feel heartbroken about the decision to leave, mostly because it put me in a precarious position, but partly because I don't feel my own country anymore.
pro	Remainers = short term comfort = long term enslavement.
pro	Remainers are just filthy pigs. It was foolish of them to think they could beat us.
anti	Remainers are ten times more patriotic than leavers. That is why the Country has not collapsed yet. We keep fighting to hold it all together in spite of the flawed thinking of tired, old folk dreaming of the good old days.
pro	Remainers are the ones responsible for devidind this country , watching the death throws of the tory party failure to carry out promises means they have committed political suicide
pro	Remainers, you can thank the leavers later.
pro	Remember that 1.5 million Londoners voted to leave the EU
pro	Remmember March 2019 at 11 AM we leave the EU for good, brexitmeansbrexit
anti	Rest of the world - OMFG USA just elected Trump. This cannot get any worse! UK - Hold my beer..........
pro	SO biased, I enjoyed seeing the faces of these liberal metropolitan elite types on the day the Leave vote won, 2016 was a great year
anti	STOP BREXIT COME BACK TO THE EU!!!
anti	Sad day for the 49% that voted against the brexit and have to live with it. England ist more and more a poor country now
anti	Sad to see people sharing their congratulations to GB for gaining independence. They have never been the opposite of independent. What a sad day 31th January was.
pro	Scotland should wake up no point being in a dictatorship of the eu that sturgeon is going to destroy Scotland she is doing a great job now
pro	Screw EU.
pro	Screw the EU.
pro	Screw the EU. They are failing. Brexit and Trump and nationalism is prevailing.
pro	Seeing hundreds of businesses in all industries go under because the EU dips its regulations everywhere, I will vote leave.
anti	Seems like if the EU had actually wanted Britain to stay they would have done more to keep them in than just calling the Brexiteers nasty names and mocking them at every opportunity for their legitimate concerns. And I say that as someone who thinks it's a bad idea for them to leave.
anti	Seriously, anyone, someone, I'll take anything at this point. Give me 1 good reason for Britain to leave the EU.
pro	Sign the leave with no deal government petition and show Tony Blair he cannot just take over
pro	So all we hav had from @StrongerIn is scaremongering, personal attacks and talking Britain down while @vote_leave have been #ProjectHope
pro	So desperate to hang on to their money and anything else they think will get them brownie points with the EU!!!....If they succeed in keeping us tied to the EU ..then I think they will have a shock because it won't be as they think ..IMO
pro	So it looks like the 4-day 1st war of Brexit is officially over: Brexiters got all excited on Brexit day
pro	So long Britain and good luck! Well deserved. Love and support from a Franco-British
anti	So maybe we will drop Brexit?
pro	So proud of England right now!!! Good job and God bless from the USA
pro	So proud to be British. Goodbye failing EU and good ridence!!
anti	So sad to be waving goodbye to my children’s EU citizenship. Here’s hoping they get that elusive something that nobody has yet identified in return...#Brexit 😢
anti	So this is how liberty dies. With thunderous applause
pro	So where is the EU going to find 67 million rich (by worrld standards) consumers with a high disposable income to replace the UK?....not Serbia or Turkey thats for sure
anti	So, Brexiters, are you looking forward to dirty beaches, destruction of wild life habitat, scrapping of workers’rights, hormones in animal feed, noisy, over-powerful, energy-consuming vacuum cleaners, etc.?
anti	Some IT companies are already shifting out of their UK bases.I fear for job security
anti	Some of those in Northern Ireland who want to remain in the EU could call for a referendum to rejoin the country of Ireland
pro	Sooner or later the Authoritarian Left will have to get it through their thick heads that the people are sick of their top-down administration of unaccountable power.
pro	Sorry James I don't agree with you. The backstop and ANY restrictive conditions which ties us to the EU must be dropped. They are unilaterally trying to stop any competition from the UK. Totally unacceptable. It amazes me the way politicians just ignore any facts that contradict their view point.
pro	Sovereign Independent UK, sounds good. After transition period - free to forge its own destiny unshackled from the EU beast.
anti	Starvation is coming to our country thanks Nigel were are money for NHS??? ucking lair
anti	Stay in EU STAY IN EU STAY IN EUROPE
pro	Still amazing. Proud of the U.K. from a fan across the pond
anti	"Still baffles me there are people celebrating their rights and protections are being removed. And not even in a sneaky lawyer talk way, the PM is straight up telling them ""You know all those regulations that prevented companies from selling you shit food? That's gone now, jolly good."""
anti	Still have to pay dues and follow EU rules? LMAO so citizens got swindled as usual you're still lead by that draconian dictatorship of far left radicals.
anti	Stock up on food and medicine Brexit is a coming.
anti	Stockpiles of despair at record levels after another week of Brexit
anti	Stop Brexit
pro	Stop moaning stupid Remainers, we hate the EU.
pro	Stop so many migrants coming in, allow for greater controll with trade with the rest of the world, be able to have our own maritime borders not to be shared for fishing, to save £257,000,000 a week on eu taxes, stop our echonomy from growing a a slow rate
pro	Stop the paranoia. If EU is so great then why are Norway and Switzerland not regretting their decision not to join it?
anti	Stupid brits. They have the best EU deal of any member but always wanted more. Good riddance....
pro	Such equally Arrogant and Ignorant people these Remoaners are.
pro	Switzerland is doing just fine not being in the EU. What’s the difference?
anti	Take another vote now that people know exactly what the choices are, which they didn't back in 2016!
anti	Tbh I don't think we should have left in the first place
pro	Thank God for Brexit. Thank you Britain. Signed patriotic Irishman.
pro	Thank God we voted to leave!!!!!
pro	Thank god we left.
pro	Thank you, Mr. Farage, for having led this fight. Let's hope the next chapters commence soon, with quite a few other European countries following the UK's example.
anti	Thanks for your answer. Seems like the whole Brexit campaign was built on that NHS promise which turned out to be absolute bullshit. Shame we will still leave the EU though.
pro	That was best moment ever we out of eu
pro	The 'stayers' are just using basic scaremongering, tiring now it is.. I'm still voting LEAVE. Get Boris in and Dave out come June 23. Independence day will come!!
pro	The Back stop is a full stop , so we never leave the EU its a trap
anti	The Brexit may very well be the dumbest idea since Donald Trump.
anti	The British have made a huge mistake.
pro	The British kneel to no man or Cartel.
pro	The British people DEMAND a NO DEAL! We voted to leave, we did not vote on making deals before we leave!
pro	The British separating themselves is the best thing that ever happened to Europe. Europeans will develop and thrive better than ever without the less than worthless Brits
pro	The British will never surrender their culture, history nor their sovereignty to the Euro communists. You may thank Nigel Farage for that. Top -HO!!!!
pro	The Customs Union is a central pillar of the EU and is enshrined in the EU's 1957 Treaty of Rome. To not leave the Customs Union is to not leave the EU. People voted to Leave, not leave a bit. Anything but a clean Brexit is a betrayal.
anti	The Divorce is Finalized.......now what Mr Farage? Who's going to build this new Britain when the grey Brexiteers have all died off in 20 years and you're sunning yourself in the South of Spain. How will the common UK citizen benefit from leaving the common market?
pro	The EU as a political union is anti-democratic as it undermines parliamentary sovereignty and makes UK citizens subject to laws made by people they didn't vote for.
anti	The EU brought peace to a Europe plagued with wars, revolutions and dictatorships. Let us never forget that the EU is a long term project to bring peace and stability to Europe
pro	The EU has destroyed Europe. It's sad! I'm glad Great Britain, the land of my ancestors, is going to leave.
pro	The EU has proven to be a failure. Its current hegemon has imposed an influx of millions of people, without checking their precedent, on millions of Europeans and supposedly 'sovereign' countries who had no say in it at all.
pro	The EU in its current guise has its days numbered.
pro	The EU is a disgrace!!!!!! They are scared because they know this globalist social experiment is failure!!!!!!
pro	The EU is a garbage fire..
pro	The EU is a new version of the USSR
pro	The EU is a rotting corpse. Every country should follow the UK and get out of it before the necrosis spreads to them.
pro	The EU is as bad as Democrats trying to take our guns..
pro	The EU is evil. Brexit now!
pro	The EU is for wimpy peoples. UK is showing strength.
anti	The EU is in the driving seat. Brits need to stop thinking they're the powerful empire they once was. They're not. Their empire was defeated long ago. They're nothing but an insignificant island nation that needs the EU more than the EU needs them.
anti	The EU is like marriage: those outside want to get in, whilst those inside want to get out. But divorces are expensive, not easy and often argumentative: that's why so many prefer to stay married.
anti	The EU is not always perfect but it has provided us with peace for many years now
pro	"The EU is not pleased? ""I urge the #UK to clarify its intentions as soon as possible"". I think they just did...BYE!"
anti	The EU is one of the largest economies in the world, it is the largest import and/or export partner of many countries. You'd have to be deluded to want to leave that club.
pro	The EU is restrictive and undemocratic. Vote leave.
anti	The EU is so much mire than just economics
pro	The EU is so undemocratic. The EU forces austerity. The EU makes Keynesian adjustments impossible on a nation basis and is viciously globalist. And that’s why there’s also plenty on the left in Britain that voted for Brexit— the left lives democracy, the left hates austerity and lowering wages due to loss of sovereignty.
pro	The EU is still in denial of the fact that we are no longer a ‘member state’ that they can push around and dictate to but a free, democratic country now able to make decisions in the best interest of our nation.
anti	The EU legislation includes the Environment, labour laws(such as the 40-hour max work week), etc. If we leave its likely we will just implement the same if not stronger restrictions on our firms
pro	The EU policies on immigration has been a disaster for the UK
pro	The EU seems problematic, I hope it falls apart.
anti	The EU should not be soft on Britain. Be reasonable, but Britain wanted the divorce, and should not be able to share in future profits/growth by the family. They wanted independence - let them have it.
pro	The EU was a failed experiment. About time all the other countries exit as well
pro	The EU was never supposed to turn into a Government.
anti	The EUROPEAN UNION was a British idea. Now they want out. Well enjoy being Poor. Enjoy eating you Mad COW Beef.
pro	The European Union is a massive bureaucracy where the people do not even get to choose if or when politicians get elected. Britain is the first to realize this
anti	The European it is always to have stronger than ever that allies and friends and other country as well because this is for for the future to work together but now that what you're seeing that Great Britain is no more it the European no more it is well out by their own by them self and only time will tell
pro	The Guardian readers must be hating this positive vision of the future.
pro	The Islamic immagrants are destroying the Europe. And the British people don't want that. So, Brexit is reasonable. And of course, coming back to EU is a very bad idea now. So, I think Jeremy Corbyn and his Labor Party are so naive :0
anti	The U.K. (until it inevitably breaks up) is about to find out how small and insignificant it really is on the world stage.
anti	The U.K. should stop this nonsense called Brexit, because most of the people of the U.K. do not want a Brexit anymore.
pro	The UK did not want to be part of the one giant EU Superstate unlike Ireland, Britain gave Brussels a chance to make compromises and maybe keep us on board and they did not hence we are leaving the institutions of the EU January 31st 2020 at 11pm.
pro	The UK exit from the EU is nothing but a glorious defeat for the cancerous socialist libreals who are literally ruining the world. Well done British people!
pro	The UK finally gave their citizens what they wanted years ago. Now they will be much like the rest of the World and make their own destiny.
pro	The UK flourished for centuries before 1972, they'll be just fine. If the vote to remain in '75 was good enough, so is this.
anti	The UK government is still keeping “no deal” as an option, but they don’t want people to talk about it
anti	The UK has now moved to the bottom of the EU growth table. And somewhere near the top of the inflation league table. The pound now buys 10% less imports than it did before the Brexit vote.
anti	The UK has really shot themselves in the foot. With a cannon.
pro	The UK is a white Christian nation and thank god that this vote proved that the majority of Brits want it to stay that way.
anti	The UK is really, really screwed up. I mean really, really really screwed up. Can leaders be this stupid?
pro	The UK must be free from a despotic EU empire, now!
pro	The UK should be ashamed of being suckered into giving up their sovereignty in the first place.
pro	The UK voted for Brexit because it's a stupid idea to have your laws made by unelected foreigners who you can't kick out if you dislike what they do.
pro	The UK was never really the same as other European countries. You still needed a passport and go through customs. To me I am happy they are out and then everyone can get on with life and business.
anti	The UK wil lose a lot of income and Scotland whants independence even more now. If you are in a union you are stronger and now you lost income, stability and allies. It doesn't look so good for the UK
anti	The UK won't recover for a solid 20 years now right?
anti	The beginning of the decline of a once-great nation.
anti	The best brexit of all, is no brexit at all.
anti	The brexit will even negatively affect me in germany and I'm really angry about it
anti	The brexiters just don't get it..... The fact the EU have commissioned this report puts them way ahead of the UK. The report allows them to think ahead and put in place damage limitation measures - unlike the UK. Because the EU are planning properly, it will hurt them far less than the UK. It's quite simple but clearly not simple enough for brexiters.
anti	The case for Brexit was made on rhetorical flourishes and promises and bluster. A lot of promises on which people voted have turned out to be undeliverable. It was a false prospectus.
anti	The clever Brexiteers resign from the government before the starving public seek to hang them.
pro	The concept of the EU is great. The current implementation is absolutely awful.
anti	The economic Damage to the UK over Brexit will be immense. Then maybe people will learn, unfortunately the hard way but hopefully they will learn there is strength in numbers and not in isolationism.
pro	"The electorate were not asked to vote for ""brexit"" or a ""deal"". We were simply asked to vote on whether or not we wanted to leave the EU. A majority voted to leave. Now accept the democratic vote and get on with it. No ""deal"" no problem!"
pro	The eu is a better place now
pro	The eu would be ok if it wasn’t political. The eu should only be about trade. That’s it. Go Brexit
pro	The eu would be ok if it wasn’t political. The eu should only be about trade. That’s it. Go Brexit.
anti	The fact that British government wants to start trade deal negotiations right after leaving the Union confirms that the Brexit was very dumb decision in the first place. Anyway, what done is done. Just remember that democracy isn't flawless.
pro	The focus should be on making sure Brexit happens”
pro	The future holds freedom and autonomy and the securing of democracy. Good job Brits - congrats from Canada.
pro	The greatest act of democracy for 70 years.
pro	The main reason people voted for leave was to reclaim our sovereignty.
pro	The majority of people voted leave during the referendum despite the lies of the remainers. We should leave as the majority of voters democratically decided. No need for a second referendum
pro	The majority voted for Brexit, yet UK is still in EU today because of elites like this guy don't actually believe in Democracy.
pro	The majority voted to leave but typical coward politicians won’t institute the people’s will.
anti	The more you look at Norway or Switzerland, the less attractive their position appears
pro	The most important public face of Britain's entry into the European Community/Union was the idiot and Conservative Party Prime Minister, Edward Heath, who signed the treaty of membership in 1972. He told the people that the then European Economic Community, or EEC, was just a free trade zone and not planned to be a centrally-controlled United States of Europe. Heath was asked in 1990 in a BBC interview if he had known all along that Britain was signing up to a federal European state. He replied: 'Of course, yes'. By then it didn't matter, the deed was long done. Sir Crispin Tickle, one of Heath's negotiators, has admitted that the government covered up the full implications of membership and said the rule was 'don't talk about this in public'. VOTE LEAVE
pro	The only mistake that the UK made over Brexit is not doing 30 years earlier!
pro	The only reason why I support brexit is because it gets us the hell away from Article 13.
anti	The only thing Torykipper Brexit UK deserves is to be ignored and sidelined completely. How dare we play so recklessly with peace in Northern Ireland. Disgusting. Reprihebsuble. We are a pariah.
anti	The only thing guaranteed to come from Brexit is a worse relationship with Europe. It really is a simple as that.
pro	The only vote should be Teresa’s deal or wto deal. My family & I are aware of a few years of hardship but very happy to be free from the clutches of the eu
anti	The perfect example of a country driving itself off a cliff and crashing to the ground, just because some people said the country could fly and apparently more than 50% of the population is utterly stupid
anti	The politicians that pushed for brexit should be put in jail for convincing the public that it would be easy with no consequences.
anti	The pound took a knocking today against both the euro and the dollar. Surely the markets haven’t lost faith in glorious #Brexit already? It’s only Monday.
anti	The problem is: brits are unaware of how bad the constitution of their own economy is. Basically anything besides finance is dead. However, as a fellow EU citizen I found their constant thatcheresque wish for lower financial contributions into the EU household unbearable. So, I guess that’s Karma.
pro	"The real Brexit debate was in 2016. I'm sorry, but this is sedition. Either you believe in democracy or not. There's no such thing as a soft Brexit. You either leave or you don't. We didn't vote to ""half-leave""."
pro	The reason for Brexit was taxation without representation simple as that.
anti	"The ridiculous attitude of the UK, is still "" 27 countries needs us more than we need 27 Countries"""
pro	The self loathing radical left wants to collapse UK society to be reborn as a socialist society.
anti	The sensible solution is to stay in EU.
pro	The silent majority have walked through fire & remainer establishment brimstone, to bring the united Kingdom back to its rightful place as one of the truly great democracies, congratulations on your victories.
pro	The start of the British Union
pro	The term ‘awkward squad’ comes to mind - or ‘bullies in the playground’! Can’t wait to LEAVE!
pro	The territory of fascism creeps ever nearer. 'Brexit is completed. So do not use the term ‘Brexit’, save as a historic
pro	The traitors in politics who are betraying the democratic majority are the real issue.
anti	The truth hidden by the Brexiteers is coming out quick and fast now. We will need new licences roaming on phones will be charged £365 million we were supposedly paying a week another lie, the leavers will have their Brexit but the UK will be set back decades.
anti	The truth is even to this day majority of british people dont know what they voted for
pro	The turkeys really are voting for xmas, the EU will be bankrupt by the summer if they keep behaving so poorly
anti	The uk will suffer a lot because of brexit.
pro	The value of sovereignty cannot be measured by any economist's formula.
pro	The vast majority of MP's don't want Brexit and so they are trying to screw us. Don't dare to stop it from happening. There will be riots like you have never seen.
pro	The voters told them what they wanted to do in 2016 - leave the EU - and these liars and incompetents simply do not want to do that, they never listen and they never learn.
pro	The war will never be over. The left will never stop trying to take away our freedom and prosperity and replacing with their totalitarian nightmare vision
anti	The way that the left wing media characterises Brexiteers as either racist or stupid is unfair - some of them are both.
pro	The whole EU saga is a sham, a place for big business to make lots of money at the expense of the people they `say’ they represent.
anti	The world needs unification, not division.
anti	Then wait and see what your so called sovereignty is good for when Brexiteers like Gove, Johnson and JRM cut down social care, the NHS and make you work like a slave - if you have a job left at all!
anti	There are two kinds of European nations. There are small nations and there are countries that have not yet realized they are small nations.
anti	There aren't any racists in my family, so we're relatively safe. I'm not saying everybody who voted leave is racist. I'm just saying that everybody who is racist voted to leave.
anti	There is mainly 1 reson I think brexit is stupid, the UK had many privileges in the EU compared to the rest of the member nations but they are abandoning them to have a less good deal than they had before. Plus, when they come back (because i am convinced they will one day) they will have to negotiate with a stronger EU than before and they will get non of the advantages they had. Basically they are leaving their very good deal to come back and get a worst one
anti	There is no Brexit that protects jobs. You know this. You can make the case that we should do it anyway if you want to, but to lie and say there’s a brexit that will protect jobs at this stage is incredibly irritating and wrong.
pro	There is no choice but Brexit. The EU won’t change, and the UK cannot get what it wants. We will still be associated with, and co operate where possible with our neighbours. But ultimately we shall be free and independent. Roll on Brexit folks!!
anti	There is no form of Brexit that will be good for our country but a no-deal Brexit will be the most catastrophic of them all.
pro	There is nowhere for our MP’s to hide with no membership of the EU. Anyway try not to generalise against the people that voted one way. There are many different reasons to vote against the EU, and many are very valid.
anti	There should be a second referendum and after seeing how damaging this all thing is I know my choice on the next referendum.
pro	There trying to use scare tactics to get people to say deal. Which is bullshit we are English we will get by we always do. We can still exsport don't worry about that
anti	There was a correlation between education level and likelyhood to vote remain.
pro	There will be no disastrous consequences,neither will we go without any medication.That has been confirmed by the Gov. The scare stories are purely made up cos the elite don’t want 2deliver #Brexit Remain rebel MPs are weakening the hand of our country &strengthening the EUs hand
anti	There's also no mention of the costs the UK gouverment has made because of Brexit. Like paying a ferry company without ships.
anti	There's far too much uncertainty associated with an EU exit. From Farmers concerned about the future of their CAP payments to Businesses decided the future of their firms, the prospect of a Brexit poses far too much uncertainty and risk.
anti	There's nothing good in Brexit.
anti	There's only one way to prevent the self-immolation of the formerly United, now Disunited Kingdom; CANCEL BREXIT NOW!
anti	These Brexiters are very dangerous.
pro	These EU creeps have been stealing from us for years , time to stop no more money no more fish end it now, invest in trawler net cutting patrol ships now. Tell BMW VW , french farmers to cut staff now.
anti	They chose Pride over Prosperity, that's dumber than having the Royal Family
pro	They need us we don't need them
pro	They say that being magnanimous in both victory and defeat raises us above the apes and closer to God. But I'm in the mood for beating my chest with gay abandon, screeching wildly and flinging shit in the general direction of @davidschneider . I care not. #BrexitCelebration
pro	They shouldnt get a penny anyway, we have ploughed billions into their hairbrained schemes whilst our own investment needs have been overlooked in manufacturing, agriculture and fishing and stupid projects as far wide as Fifi, no iffence to Fiji. Nit to mention the massive impact on our infrastructure due to mass imm igr ation. They shoukd pay us to leave.
pro	They tried to stop it but we never gave up. We are now a free and independent nation once again. Time for celebration for the 17.4 million people who believed in the potential of our country.
pro	They voted like anti-globalism poets, they voted as british... and won their freedom
pro	They walked away from external control of Brussels. Congratulations to the people of great Britain!!! I hope the BBC after leaving will start to work democratically and impartially in the interests of their own country, not for Brussels officials and bureaucrats)
anti	They went to all that effort at Parliament Square but couldn't even sing the national anthem right. Doesn't show much hope for our future.
anti	They will realize that they stand without and trade deal with the EU, and after slamming the door leaving EU, the chance for any EU country will forget and make a new deal is small. It’s like going to a gathering, only wanting to enjoy the cake, but leave the dishes to others.
anti	This Boris guy is so delusional it's getting insane!
pro	This bloke is the exact reason nearly all of Britian voted britex
pro	This country stood alone for a thousand years before the EU so can stand alone again and rebuild what has been given away to the unelected bureaucrats in Brussels. Given away without the consent of the people.Can you imagine Elizabeth 1 handing power and sovereignty to any other country?? This once great country will be great again OUT of the EU.
pro	This days after we left the biggest free trade bloc in the world with the determination to put up trade barriers.
anti	This exceptionalism of the politicians is mindbaffling and insane for every non-Brit.
anti	This has nothing to do with old voters dying or new voters arriving and everything to do with the fact that: BREXIT IS A CRAP IDEA
pro	This is NBC so it's pure globalist propaganda. It's 100% designed to influence people against Brexit. I don't know why that specific group is of any importance. These Jews are supporting an idiology that demands importing millions of Muslims into Europe, and then they wonder why antisemitism is spiking.
anti	This is awful it has been snatched away from us this is disgusting I just feel bad for everyone who didnt want this including myself how is he bringing us together by separating us ruining our country
anti	This is hilarious. You Brits. You know what's gonna happen? You'll end up not only back in the EU but also with Corbyn as PM. God damn it UK. What have you done?
pro	This is in no way surprising. It shows how little power the EU has over us, something May has persistently and wilfully refused to accept. They need us more than we need then. We should never have got into negotiations in the first place. Thy were completely unnecessary.
anti	"This is the point where ""Democracy respecting"" Brexiteers go into overdrive to try to avert another vote."
pro	This is what happens when you take advantage of richer countries' generosity. If you do it for too long, they leave and lock you out
pro	This is why people voted to leave the EU. Not racism, not because they are 'little Englanders' but this. If the entire country looked like and had even half the levels of wealth London, the south East and prosperous cities such as Oxford, Bath and Bristol had then maybe the result would have been different. Fact is, once you get north of the Watford gap you quickly see large parts of the midlands and north are an utter wasteland economically. Politicians have acknowledged this for decades, yet have done nothing. I have seen what places like Hartlepool, Stockton on Tees, Middlesbrough and Hull are like. Many places in the less prosperous Eastern Europe EU countries are better off than these places
pro	This isn’t nothing new, E.U. Have taken far more business out of the U.K.
anti	This makes me sad i love the diversity of cultures in britain and some of the best drs are immigrants as are many in important positions contributing their skills to our country im ashamed of this country since brexit
pro	This should have happened years ago, shame it’s taken so long
anti	"This so called ""nationalism"" is going to cost the UK billions and billions."
pro	This was posted 4 minutes after the Brexit happened. Bye Britain. (Note: I’m not actually living in the EU, just thought of doing it anyway.)
anti	This will come back and haunt them. Trust!!
anti	Those celebrating will soon feel the truth, and will be the first who crawl back to the EU begging for assistance.
pro	Though, to be honest, immigration had nothing to do with my reasoning for supporting Brexit
pro	Three and a half years later and we are FINALLY leaving and for one I'm glad to be gone.
pro	Thumps up Mr. Farage.
anti	Time is moving on and so is Nissan. The next SUV is build in Japan instead of Sunderland. Well done Brexitiers.
anti	Time to act to take back control and to vote remain!!!
pro	Time to create a basic Bill of Rights for people of the UK to avoid the troubles of the past.
pro	To all those heroes that voted leave, it must feel good. We've got back our country.
pro	To cancel the Brexit and rejoin the EU now is an equivalent to an abandon of a good ship to jump on a sinking ship, because the EU is a dead man walking!
pro	To see these EU scoundrels squirm with their displeasure is quite satisfying.
anti	Today is a bad day for Britain, America & Democracy in general. Britain is leaving the EU. Trump is getting away with the Impeachment Inquiry without any witness's & democracy is going down the drain in a hand-basket.
pro	Today is the day! Waited so long for this, start of a great future for the UK!
pro	Today millions of people will get to celebrate the day the people beat the establishment.
pro	Tomorrow is a momentous day for our country! The great opportunities that will arise must be gabbed with both hands. I am most excited about the societal healing that can now take place. 🇬🇧
anti	Too many low skill workers ?? 2/3 of immigrants hold degree . don't blame immigrants , blame the fact that you people like to drop out of schools , most of your medical professionals are immigrants.
anti	Total tosh, brexit is for dumb-ass racists.
anti	Totally irresponsible when they can retract Article 50. Then take the time to negotiate the deal they really want. This action will destroy Britain.
pro	"Trust channel 4 to put ""Brexit"" and ""racism"" in the same sentence. As if all those who want Britain to leave the EU are racists. Trying to twist and tar the decision as usual."
anti	Two years too late Stephen, Brexit is the UK's greatest blunder of modern times.
anti	Typical Brexiter idea - expect the EU to buy you a bike and teach you how to use it. After the slander they have received at the hands of the UK media, I'd be worried they will just let us roll down a hill into heavy traffic.
anti	Typical Britian, Not wanting to play nice with the rest of the world.
pro	Typical leftist regressive nonsense. Long live Brexit and down with globalism.
anti	U.K. Should stay in eu
pro	U.K. was a lot way better before they joined the EU globalist.
anti	UK has never been more separated until Brexit
pro	UK is a great nation. Her people are strong. Brexit will be just be another chapter in its history. LONG LIVE THE QUEEN. FUCK EU.
anti	UK is going to be like the Holy Roman Empire a place that is neither United or a Kingdom
anti	UK is so screwed. What a joke!
pro	UK will be the better for it. The faster they get away from liberal Europe, the better.
anti	UK will never decide to exit EU.
anti	UK will no longer be able to blame EU for all its problems.
pro	VIVA UK AND SEPARATION FROM EVIL GENOCIDE SOCIETYS AND THEIR UNION
anti	Vote Remain
anti	Vote remain!!!
pro	WATCH 21 times Theresa May promised that the UK would leave the EU's Customs Union. She must keep that promise.
anti	WHAT A SHAME! If only someone had warned him #Brexit was a shit idea....
anti	WON'T SOMEBODY PLEASE THINK OF THE CHILDREN?!?!!!
anti	Wake up Britain! ....and change the clowns who created this mess! One of them could be seen on this video...laughing idiot!!!
pro	Watched the whole damn thing. #BREXIT is gonna happen. The people voted.
pro	Watched your video still want out
pro	We Got A Great Win For Freedom Today!!! God Bless an independent and free England
pro	We all know the EU is corrupt and a political union - those who can't see it need to do real research about the issue
pro	"We always knew that it would come down to the fine line knowing what we know about Brussels bureaucrats and what they have to lose. Though we didn't expect Tory MPs to shovel 'sh it' on the British population after a democratic vote. Reminder of Cameron's EU campaign leaflet: ""Once in a generation decision..."" and ""The referendum on Thursday, 23rd June is your chance to decide if we should remain in or leave the European Union"" and ""This is your decision - The Government will implement what you decide"".  Tory MPs should be reminded what was categorically promised prior and throughout the campaign and stop trying to implement their own personal views on the British public. It's time for those renegade MPs (Labour and Tory) to be reminded that they were elected to act for their constituents and not for themselves. Write to your MP now! Leave means Leave!"
pro	We are all sick of the EU and glad to be off
anti	We are literally gambling with the UK's economy! It could go either way (very good or very bad) and we won't know until its too late. OK the EU economy isn't exactly in great shape, but this is exactly why it needs to reform.
pro	We are so much more than a star on a flag, so right. Happy Brexit day.
pro	We can do a lot better on our own to deal with the world, we don’t even have a seat at the world trade organisation anymore, it’s bad for the UK we sell them a lot less that they sell us. There is no negatives in leaving as far as I am concerned.
pro	We can just sit back and be free by default. I'm going to vote out tomorrow to make the pain go away quicker.
pro	We can't afford to abandon Brexit, Europe will see us caving in as their victory & our weakness which they'll exploit going forward, It will put us at a disadvantage when dealing with other EU members, regardless of how we voted we can't afford to not leave.
pro	We did it! We're out! We have FINALLY left the EU!
pro	We did not even have a chance to join the EU, they just made us and now we have to pay millions, BILLIONS to leave.Not cool but it’s good we’re leaving.
pro	We didn't vote for deals we voted out so NO deal OUT
pro	We don't want the EU. It's not right wing... It's the feeling of the nation.
pro	We don’t want to reopen we are going to leave
anti	We get owned by the USA and every other country we try and trade with.
pro	We had a democratic vote and the Remoaners lost
anti	We had a good run lads. Will be a strange feeling not being an EU citizen for the first time in my life in a few days. I do hope we will be back in future, although to be honest I think the EU is better off without us.
pro	We had a vote we voted leave get over it.
pro	We had our vote forget about a second!!!
pro	We have become too dependent on trade with the EU because we didn't have a choice, now there is a whole world out there...
anti	We have been lead into this path with a dead end by the BREXIT lies and the whole generations of UK people will pay for it.
pro	We have done it! We are free!
pro	We have to look after ourselves because no one else will,the EU is destroying the UK and europe
pro	We in the UK made the right choice to leave the eu
pro	We joined the European Economic Community but it changed into a monster that wants to rule every aspect of our lives.
pro	We look forward to doing business with a FREE and INDEPENDENT Britain.
pro	We love you UK! The bold reclaimation of your independence shines as an inspiration to all nations that wish to preserve their national identity. Much affection from the US!
anti	We must stop brexit I want my life back
pro	We need hard brexit. Definitely
pro	We need to leave, we do not need to be part of the EU and are better off alone!
anti	We need to remain in the EU. End of conversation.
pro	We no longer need to bow the knee to Brussels. They need to realise this and that you can't bully a country that is no longer a member of the EU.
pro	We now Thrive. Good riddance EU
pro	We should not be subject to rulings made by foreign courts or regulations and laws made in foreign parliaments. The EU is completely undemocratic and is used to by politicians to evade the voter and public opinion.
pro	We stood alone in Europe twice before & Europe will be eternally in our debt for doing so. We should stand alone again.
pro	We voted LEAVE - not for a deal.
pro	We voted Leave. We didn’t vote for Mays BRINO, or for these stupid delays and silly lies.
pro	We voted leave because the politicians of the EU we're meant to represent us & instead they dictate us. No deal will is our better option than remaining with those who demand things. Someone who demands things from others is not an ally. I'd rather have no deal. We will suffer for a while only to adapt & flourish afterwards as the EU kills itself.
pro	We voted to leave now just get on with it no more talking do as the majoriy voted for
pro	We voted to leave. We mustn't let the Remoaners destroy democracy.
anti	We want MORE migration so why would we even think about quitting the EU?
pro	We want a hard Brexit don't give the Eu a penny and if they want to play hard Nuke them.
pro	We want our country back
pro	We want our country back. Come on and roll on BREXIT! Put the Great back into Britain.
pro	We want our own laws. The rest of EU have gone to pieces also
pro	We wanted no deal. We want to leave, pay nothing and walk away from the EU mess
anti	We will be in stone age after leaving EU so vote in
anti	"We will be weaker. We will be poorer. Some of Johnson's backers will prosper- Rees Mogg's Dublin-based investment fund may produce a decent return even if Mogg is not himself a particularly savvy investor. We will have less consumer protection, chlorinated chicken, and people with darker skin will be more intrusively questioned, on the street and in the pub. ""Where are you from? No, where are you really from?"""
pro	We will make our own laws now if the EU don’t like it then we take our trade elsewhere. The World is a Shopping Mall, the Countries are shops, we choose who we buy from.
pro	We will never give up! Why? Because we won! The people spoke and the goverment said they will deliver that vote! So deliver!
anti	We will see who still wants brexit when the economic impact of the decison is felt. This is not the right time to do a deal of this magnitude.
pro	We won’t have to allow freedom of movement to EU citizens, so we’ll be able to greatly reduce the number of people coming to the U.K.
anti	We're in big trouble.... We left the EU which means all the stuff will become expensive... This is sad
pro	We're more than a star on someone else's flag. We'll decide our own laws. We'll decide who comes in. We'll decide who can fish in our waters. Oh, and we'll spend that £20 billion per year we put into the EU on us.
pro	We're not blaming the EU, we're leaving the EU and good riddance. Let the EU ship sink but not before we've got our share of the assets we've paid for.
pro	Well 99% of educated people want to leave Mr PM. Listen to the British. There is a lot of risk staying in. #brexit
pro	Well I'm a no deal person. We voted to leave, we have no say in who runs the E.U (there done in secret). We will be great again. With steel, dairy, fishing and car industry's will be reborn giving ppl jobs and the government tax. We keep our money and invest where we want. We trade with the rest of the world, with new strong trade deals.. driving down the price electronics and other goods. Let the crumpling block fall apart we will show that other countries can do the same a prosper...don't fear it, embrace the challenge
anti	Well I’m in Ireland so I thinks it pretty shit
pro	Well done UK , Freedom !!!
anti	Well technically all old (65+) people voted leave which is so stupid they get to vote because they wont feel the consequences as much us younger people
anti	Well technically all old (65+) people voted leave which is so stupid they get to vote because they wont feel the consequences as much us younger people ALSO northern Ireland and Scotland voted to stay but England voted to leave so If Brexit does happen Scotland and northern Ireland will make a vote to leave GB and Join EU
anti	Well they're certainly writing history... on how to drill your country's economy into the ground
anti	Well they're certainly writing history... on how to drill your country's economy into the ground :)
anti	Well those legends that brits are dumb af just became a reality. Wp brexiteers now you can go and fck ur self.
pro	"Were the UK to exit, essentially because it does not follow the idea of political unity of Europe or that the solution to every problem is ""more Europe,"" which a certain European elite believes, the sky would not necessarily fall."
pro	We’ll be able to negotiate bilateral trade agreements with other countries that solely take into consideration the nation’s interest.
anti	We’ve got years of this stupidity to go, yet. Hubris, spin, polemic and lies will issue from the government day in and day out, month in and month out. All for what? For nothing tangible, visible or useful. For a fantasy.
pro	What A Glorious Day 😂🇬🇧😂🇬🇧😂 #BrexitDay
pro	What a bunch of morons the sooner we leave the better.
pro	What a dangerous plan the EU has for us.get out now infact all you in the EU get your own county's back.
pro	What a legacy. An opportunist who was willing to sacrifice his country just to further his career.
anti	What a mess
anti	What a shame Britain left .. EU is a primary reason we haven’t had a WWIII yet.
pro	What did Britain say to its trade partners? See EU later
anti	What happens we all get flushed down the loo.
pro	What have we gained culturally from being in the EU???
pro	What is the bloody problem with nationalism?
anti	What was is so good about brexit. All the old people voted brexit and it has ruined all the young sensible people's lives. The economy has crashed and there's no way we'll be in the single market. Fml
pro	When we get 80% of our fishing waters back and start buying our home grown potatoes from Lincolnshire the National Dish will be back on the Menu at affordable prices. The French can have their Moules de mare we don’t eat buckets of slugs
anti	When you vote today, vote for prosperity, for tolerance, for cooperation. #VoteRemain to keep Britain #INtogether and #StrongerIn #EUref
pro	Who are they? Are they starting a new job as waiters in a chicken restaurant and enjoying a team lunch before they start their shift? #ProBrexit #British #UK #Proud
pro	Who in their right mind would want to stay in the EU after all of this!
anti	Who would've thought this would be only the second most stupid thing people did in 2016
pro	Why Brexit happened? Because people vote for it to happen. Deal with it (it's called democracy by the way)
pro	Why are uk journalists acting like they're reporting for the eu? It is cringeworthy listening to the buttsucking interviews they conduct with MEPs.
anti	Why do I feel like this is the week things are going to spiral out of control?
anti	Why do people assume that if we are no longer part of Europe WE will have control of our affairs? It's an illusion. AT BEST, the UK Government will have control and the links between the Government and the people that voted is tenuous indeed.
anti	"Why does anyone expect honesty concerning Brexit? It continues the way it started. About 7 million of those most paying the price today were not even allowed a vote in our ""democratic"" process..."
pro	Why would anyone vote to be run by over paid, non-elected EU bureaucrats who answer to no one. 48% of the voters are just insane or ill informed.
pro	Will someone tell herr tusk we have a rule of law in the uk which you cannot ijust gnore. Unlike the tin pot dictatorship of he EU
pro	Within 10 years, the EU will be taking out loans from the UK. Long live the Empire!
anti	Worst Case Scenario: Scotland will soon have a new referendum to leave the UK and join the EU as a new nation. Northern Ireland would also want to leave the UK. This would cause political and military tension between England and Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland might even want to integrate with the Republic of Ireland and be in the EU as a whole. Also Spain may think that now Gibraltar is their land, and want to annex it, so that it remains in the EU. This will leave the UK in shambles. The United Kingdom of England and Wales is what will remain. War may come over Northern Ireland or Gibraltar. Geopolitical stability in the region will change, that's the only sure thing.
pro	Would rather be broke and independent than a state in the European Union. The EU is like the USA. A massive government with too much power and a love of all things money. Prepared to sell its citizens, it's resources and it's economy to whatever company can afford to bribe them. One thing us Brits have in droves is honour, the EU insults our honour. The British will never kneel!
anti	Would those who have voted to leave still voted that way if they knew would it destroy the UK
anti	Wow that farage had no idea what he did for his country lol...he made his country the only third world country of europe
anti	Wow you've got a long way to go to match the anti Brexit marches, you've only reached about a 10th. Must be so disappointing for you.
pro	Yay No UK in eu means UK can meme
anti	Yeah u're independent and I wanna inform u to forget that u will go around and colonize the world as last time. Mission impossible dudes
pro	Yeah whatever, you can stick your EU up your continental dirt bikes boxes, we’re Britons not Europeans
pro	Yeah, best decision the Brits ever made! It's called democracy you bloody snowflakes!
anti	Yes and right now the economy is going down, and no one knows how long it'll be going down for. Pound is dropping harder than Trump's approval rating and you're at risk of inflation. You can kiss your status as 5th largest economy bye-bye because you just lost a rich market of 500 million people.
pro	Yes finally we are out . Time to start building a new Britain filled with actual British people where it's not unusual to find English families in London . Can't wait for a safer , less collapsing , less crowded Britain !
pro	Yes leave the EU
pro	Yes we have left the dictatorship despite cannel 4's remoaning antics
pro	Yes we need to get out . The EU is in financial crisis.
pro	"Yes. . . we Yanks are proud of our Brit cousins who've finally said ""enough'!!Hopefully this revolution will spread to the US where we can shake off those who wish to make America a Third World country."
anti	You can dress Brexit up however you like but whenever you see a large group of Brexit supporters in one place there’s simply no disguising what it’s really about...
anti	You can see a bit of sadness on his face. He certainly voted to remain.
pro	You do realise the U.K. is one of the biggest contributors to the EU. We put in more than we get back. £250 million a week goes to the EU. Overall we paid £8.4 billion more than what we got back. That’s billions we could spend on our own country, spend on our NHS, spend on sorting out homelessness.
anti	You guys are nuts for leaving the EU! Economic suicide!
anti	You know I think the government are stalling as the more they look into it the more they realise it’s a bad idea
anti	You know what brexiteers. I'm warming up to that unicorn you voted for, even though it looks more like a donkey now... I want my donkey and I want it now! Stuff Brussels!
anti	You say you done need eu but you forgot that people from Europe fight and give the lives for Britain in ww2
pro	You voted to leave , now leave... why pay politicians to get agreements and meet when leave means leave. Nike just do it.
anti	You will come back begging us to re join. And your request should be rejected.
anti	Young brits have been stripped of their right to work and live freely in the EU by a moronic old generation.
pro	"Your forefathers did just fine without the EU, fought a massive world war, and came out okay. The Germans had nearly their entire country destroyed and rebuilt it with hard work. Finland fought the massive Soviet armies basically alone during WW2 and survived. The ""modern"" youth today are spoiled lazy parasites who expect everything to be delivered them on a silver plate. Don't even think of asking them to work, they'll just cry about those mean old pensioners who managed to survive a world war for not giving them more ""free"" stuff."
anti	as a liberal american i want to thank you england, we in the u.s. will now have i front row seat to what a trump presidency would look like. thank you for showing us a preview of what really happens when you give in to hate and fear. enjoy the example the eu is about to make out of you, it is probably going to look like something out of a prison movie. thank you for the fact that this will probably bring about actual reforms in the eu, none of which you will benefit from.
pro	awesome it’s about time we leave.
pro	because we joined it under the guise of it being a trading bloc and that's categorically not what it is now
anti	beginning of the end of UK ( england, scotland, ni and wales )... in coming years
anti	brexit is a catastrophe
anti	brexit is all about racism and xenophobia everything else is just smoke and mirrors to save face
pro	brexit was a good idea the problem is we have a neoliberal remainer handling it that will not resign she is like a turd hanging off a dogs arse.
anti	brexit was a russian created farce to turn britain and the rest of europe into a russian client state
anti	brexit will not work, back in 2025 after the the federal have push through everything the brits have been dragging their heels at
anti	british people are p'wned by banks.
anti	can no longer continue to ignore how weak the UK is alone.
anti	can't wait to see the looks on the faces of all the doleys who voted to 'kick the forners out' being handed a hoe and a pair of wellies when they go to sign on in april..
anti	champagne corks are popping in Moscow
pro	congrats vote out! no more illegal immigrantion and open borders. no more UK being run by a parent council in germany. so glad out won. good step forward for conservative values!
pro	congratulations England for Brexit, well done Johnson
anti	consumers would feel no better off by the end of 2019, with anxiety setting in over Brexit’s potential impact on jobs, house prices and equity markets.
pro	fantastic night stayed up till result was no longer in doubt went to bed very very happy .now let's get out doible quick!
anti	farewell Great Britain send our regards to the Earth's core on your free fall into oblivion
pro	finance is a small part of Brexit, we accepted we may be poorer in the short term, but we voted for self-determination, an end to unelected bureaucrats and the evil ECJ
pro	for the love of #AlmightyGod lets #leave EU. #brexit #go
anti	from the side view the grass is always greener on the other side until you get to the other side and look down on it.
anti	funny, how I'm the only one who realized that this whole Brexit thing is just a social experiment
pro	glad i voted to leave...i don't know anyone who voted to leave that would reverse their decision....leave means leave, if no deal is reached trade on WTO rules
pro	great listening to a bunch of whinging remoaners who love voting SO LONG AS IT GOES THEIR WAY
anti	i feel now that I've had my europeanness taken away from me
pro	i hope my contry would leave the EU as well (i'm from denmark)
pro	i voted leave and was working the nightshift when i got in my car at 6am friday morning ive never felt so good
pro	i voted leave for freedom
pro	i voted to leave the EU. Are you saying my vote didnt count?
anti	i wish i was old enough to vote would have picked to stay
anti	if brexit happens, The Bank of England foresees a worse economic shock than the one the UK experienced during the financial crisis, with house prices falling twice as steeply.
pro	if great britain can survive and thrive for most of its life without the e.u. then they can again become powerful as they once were!
pro	if people want to be in the European union, they should move to Europe now. if they don't like Brexit , get your stuff and leave.
anti	in a few years you find out you had a great deal you were part of the eu
anti	in chinese there is a saying that a person can be sold and be so stupid to help them count the money. that's brexiters
anti	independent from what? What did the EU actually prevent us from doing?
pro	it is about bloody time we got out sick of being told what to do by someone not from our country i am happy to be english
pro	italy will follow UK soon ! bye bye Nazi UE
anti	its important to stay in the EU for business. Most of the UKs business is with the EU.
pro	keep the faith. The EU is collapsing.
pro	leave won by 1.2 million votes. I bet u that more than 1.2 million people voted leave because of the 350million a week going to the NHS, which isn't happening
anti	less friends more enemies more possibilitys of war good job ypu played your self
anti	lets first wait one year if there are still so happy happy happy
pro	makes a lot of sense. The only people who want to stay in the EU are either totally stupid or well paid!!!
pro	no deal only way forward for the UK then and now.
pro	no deal please, lets get out of the sinking ship
pro	no trading at all is just spreaing with fear, they said the same to norway and norway is doing just fine without the EU. so they use fear to control the people.
anti	now it's time for the UK to dissolve
pro	null - are you on the same planet as the rest of us? Vote LEAVE for BRITSH jobs, people, the economy and security
anti	oh, the people voted to leave EU because we were tricked!
pro	out means out wto that's what the British voted
pro	soon all European Union members one by one Exit from European Union
anti	thank God I and my wife have now got German citzenship so we don’t have to live with the likes of Francois and his fascist mob!
pro	the EU is NOT europe, it is a political control system. wanting to leave the EU just means you are paying attention - it does not mean you want to be disconnected from europe or anywhere else. a complex matter requires thinking beyond the simple.
anti	the UK should leave allowing the EU to become a country but be allowed to rejoin later (when it has realized its mistake).
pro	the UK will blossom after brexit 92% of our exports are outside the EUSSR
pro	the best thing will be to get out of EU the filthy propaganda of better in are all lies.u.k will be finished if it stays in.E.U is colapsing anyway
pro	the people voted to leave so Stop trying to over turn it.
pro	the remain camps seems to wish the leavers should be ignored and only have disdain for them
pro	there is a point in Brexit as U.K becomes an independent and Sovereign once again.
anti	they lied about Brexit … have another referendum … FFS !!!
pro	they should obviously leave
anti	voted leave and now have changed my mind. It was a stupid choice. New referendum is needed

pro	we don't need immigrants
pro	we don't want the euro! it's a terrible currency!
anti	we need a petition for a referendum to get back in Europe
pro	what a load of rubbish. The whole establishment has been injecting fear into the public and people are scarred to death of freedom! We'll be great as an independent country. If we stay in we'll be flooded to beyond repair with loads of useless immigrants
anti	when will the brits start to realise that 350.000.000 europans are not going to drop there pants bend over just to please 65.000.000 brits
pro	yea it's really good decision for Britain to move out
anti	роverty and dооm awaits the country
pro	"“The humiliation of having a pink European Union passport will now soon be over and the United Kingdom nationals can once again feel pride and self-confidence in their own nationality when travelling, just as the Swiss and Americans can do."""
anti	“so many remainers that hate our country” I think you will find that those who love their country voted Remain. Those who put self interest above what is good for their country voted Leave. They are now struggling as they realise they were conned and it is only in the interest of the very wealthy that we should leave.
